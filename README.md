This repository contains the python code and datasets scraped for use in our paper published in the 17th IEEE International Conference on Semantic Computing 2023.

Data was scraped from 7 mental health apps that are available on both iTunes and Google Play stores.
This data was then put through various combinations of Natural Language Preprocessing techniques, and their effects were measured on how the preprocessed data performed when using sentiment analysis.
