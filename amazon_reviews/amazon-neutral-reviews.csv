3,Doesn't do what it says it does at all,0
3,Nails still split,0
3,It does whiten and moisturize.,0
3,didn't work,0
3,Product didn’t do as advertised,0
3,I bought this based on the reviews but I think this is a smelly coconut oil and didn't work as it was supposed to.,0
3,"After weeks of use,  nails stil chop and break",0
3,Hasn't made much of a difference yet but I keep using it,0
3,did not notice any results,0
3,Not really sure about this yet.  Its a hard cream.  I expected it to be thinner like a lotion.  Its greasy so you have to wipe your hands off after.I really haven't been using it long enough to give a review on whether or not it works,0
3,"My nails still split, bend, and tear. I don't use it as often as in the beginning.",0
3,"Haven't had it long. The smell is overwhelming!  So, I won't use it very often.",0
3,Used for a couple of months but didn't notice any difference with my nails.,0
3,Not as effective as I had hoped. A little thin.,0
3,Helped cuticles but not nails.,0
3,"It moisturizes, but so far I really can’t see any difference.",0
3,I didn't notice any difference between this and other nail/hand creams,0
3,It’s ok. Been using for two months now and my nails are same.,0
3,Didn’t work,0
3,Not seen any miracles but still trying after a month.,0
3,I believe it hardened my fingernails.,0
3,I can't give a rating yet I just received it and have only used 1 day.,0
3,It’s ok. But don’t thinkIt helped my nails & I put it on every day,0
3,It seems to work. The only drawback is the OVERWHELMING coconut smell.,0
3,Either this takes awhile to work or it doesn't work as much as everyone says it does. My nails are still breaking after 3 weeks...,0
3,Doesn’t work,0
3,I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because the instructions say use 3x per day. I don't have time to apply 3x per day. This means I would have to carry it around.,0
3,I received this gel no white topcoat and it was very clumpy you couldn’t even use And that’s upsetting because I love this product,0
3,The top coat is fine dries perfectly.The base however does not ever dry fully and so the nail polish peels off After a couple days no despite the top coat.,0
3,It turns a yellowish color when cured.,0
3,Not long-lasting,0
3,It does not dry and it comes right off at the slightest touch,0
3,Still have to wipe,0
3,"I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn’t the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I’ll keep using that.",0
3,I cured the base and top coats with a 45W LED Lamp for 60 seconds and they were still sticky + tacky. Even cured them for an additional 30 after that and still sticky. Tried to wipe them off after a while and it just takes the polish off. Very difficult to remove residue as well.,0
3,"It's more expensive than the one I've used before. Also my nail polish doesn't last, I'm going back to the other one I used. Atleast that one is $2 cheaper and it lasted me 2 weeks.",0
3,Has a harsh smell other then that it work good,0
3,You still have to wipe.,0
3,Doesn’t last as long as other products I’ve used.,0
3,"Kinda thick, does not last long",0
3,"Did not use for 3 months stored in a dark cupboard,  and when I went to use them they were chunky and wouldn't work",0
3,Polish is decent but one is obviously old because it arrived dry. Still usable but very dry.,0
3,It just doesn't leave the same shine as a regular wipe off...,0
3,Very thick. Takes 4 min to dry on led light,0
3,To small,0
3,The listing makes these look very special. Indeed they are attractive (if somewhat smaller than normal). But they don't do any better than the ones you buy at the drugstore.,0
3,They are very small,0
3,Difficult to hold and press down with precision. Don't waste your money.,0
3,"I’ve only used them once, but I was expecting them to be sharper. I wouldn’t spend $15 on these again.",0
3,I gave this product 3 stars because I felt it  performed exactly the same as a cheap clipper.,0
3,I was expecting something way different,0
3,"The edge is sharp and cuts easily. But due to the edge's thickness and higher grind angle, nails can often crack a tiny bit compare to my old Victorinox 8.2055.CB clippers.Ended up using some high grit sandpapers (1000, 2000 and 3000 grit) to sharpen my old clipper and put these in the drawers as emergency backups.Structurally, these are stronger than the Victorinox, and easier to cut some thicker and harder nails (like big toe nail).They works, but are not the best choice for me.",0
3,Not very sharp and to not come with file,0
3,"I've bought nail clippers at the usual department stores for years, brands like Revlon, Trim, etc. I was looking to replace a set so I researched the Harperton clippers and other brands. The reviews on this set were very good 4.6 out of 5 stars, over 10, 000 reviews and an Amazon Choice for high ratings and a well priced product. They are well made, sharp and ergonomic, but are not outstanding as some reviews claimed. They are actually a little shorter and slightly wider than the department store brands, but do not seem to cut any better and have no swing out nail file attached to the device. In my opinion, they are no better than the department stores and are more expensive.",0
3,Too heavy and herky - and more expensive than the set I got for my husband! Returning,0
3,Just trying it out...like it so far.,0
3,Smells decent,0
3,I put some of this on every time I go to the senior center or retirement home. 70% of the time works every time!,0
3,Na,0
3,The size of the bottle is too small.,0
3,To oily and goes away fast the fragrance,0
3,It doesn't work for me,0
3,N/a,0
3,Not a long lasting smell,0
3,There wasn't much scent at all. who knows if the pheromones' are working?,0
3,Wanted something spicier,0
3,It’s cool...I guess for what you pay it is what it is. I didn’t get any compliments and it’s more like an oil in a spray bottle.,0
3,I can hardly smell it on me,0
3,Scent and longevity. Oily and leaves mark on clothes.,0
3,It’s ait,0
3,See above headIine.,0
3,I don't know I think it's a normal colong,0
3,Did not notice a difference,0
3,"It’s a decent smelling cologne, I don’t think at all it contains pheromones. Unless, it has to do with one’s own body chemistry and how it reacts. Kind of expensive for the size and I would not rebuy.",0
3,None,0
3,"I'm in a rural part of the country.... It works I think,but I pair it with Armani",0
3,"I don't really use it often because it won't last for long, it's an oil and you need to re-apply. It's also a very light scent people barely smell it",0
3,The smell doesn't last long it fades away quick,0
3,Very normal.,0
3,Don't work,0
3,Enough said.,0
3,Pew,0
3,"Love the scent, but doesn't last long. Not too sure about the pheromone part. Don't think you can just rub on pheromones.",0
3,Just Ok. It’s an oil !,0
3,Normal,0
3,For the price I would expect longer longevity.,0
3,Nothing,0
3,It wasn't what I thinking it was,0
3,Could not tell any difference when I used it had not effect,0
3,Very oily when it goes on.,0
3,FOR EVERYDAY USE,0
3,"It appears to be just a plain scent, that doesn't really last long....",0
3,"The scent isnt that strong, the smell is interesting. Wont buy again. Some people didnt even notice i had it on",0
3,Nothing noticeable .. i think its a bit expensive,0
3,"While the scent is pleasing....at least to me, I’ve used other men’s cologne with more lasting results?",0
3,Not what I quite expected but I expect to use it.,0
3,Subpar longevity,0
3,Its to oily....,0
3,The smell did not last,0
3,"Smells fresh, oily. Couldn’t attract a fly even in a strip club.",0
3,Smells ok!,0
3,I believe this stuff but it doesn't work at all. No women will pay special attention to this smell at all,0
3,Clinique for men is the way to go.,0
3,My bottle was only 3/4 full when I opened it,0
3,"The scent of this perfume is light and refreshing.However, the down side is the smell doesn't last for long.",0
3,It’s okay. Smells slightly better than Axe I suppose. You get what you pay for. It could be worse.,0
3,What fragrance? None at all.,0
3,The smell went away,0
3,Cheap scent as price,0
3,Leaves spots on my clothes.,0
3,So when i received the package the entire box was soaked in the cologne. Smells decent.,0
3,Scent does not last long at all,0
3,"An average scent, nothing really unique about it",0
3,Scent does not last long!,0
3,Yup,0
3,its decent but if i put it on my neck i break out,0
3,It evaporated to quick,0
3,the scent does not last long but its ok.,0
3,"I got this product bc these type of scents should last a couple hours, but it barely lasts through the first.",0
3,it does stays long but the smell does not live up to it's ratings and reviews,0
3,5 star longevity cause I cant get the smell out. Holy moly dont buy cheap cologne!,0
3,Cheap scented,0
3,Perfume is cheap but at the same the fragrance doesn't stay for a long time. Wears off in a couple hours,0
3,The scent is very light and doesnt linger very long.,0
3,Excelente producto,0
3,I’d rather go to bealls instead,0
3,its decent for the money..,0
3,I GIVE THIS 5 STARS DOES WHAT IT SAYS,0
3,These are decent for the price I would say because it doesn’t last that long but smells decent,0
3,Smell not long,0
3,"Not saying there is anything wrong with the product. I guess I the kind of person that is use to higher end colognes. I just wanted to get something for my grudge days(I always have to wear something).It's not a  bad cologne, but just not my taste. It's subtle and wears evenly. I am aware that there are different scents, so I might need to try a different one.",0
3,"Has a light, powdery scent",0
3,The smell doesn’t last long. 🤨,0
3,Scent does not last more than an hour or so. Will not order again.,0
3,Not enough vanilla scent !,0
3,Overly vanilla for me,0
3,Smells clean......but fades too fast.,0
3,"Not a very ""woodsy"" ""Oaky"" aroma, very lite scent doesnt last long, but alot of cologne for $20.",0
3,Just ok.,0
3,Smells cheap,0
3,The smell just isn't there. Not manly at all.,0
3,Not Expecting for the Price ?,0
3,Fragrance doesn’t last long enough!,0
3,Gives me a headache,0
3,—-,0
3,Good stuff. The bottle is garbage though. Which makes it all trash. If it cant handle the shipping or it falling over once. It’s no good. The qc for the cap is trash.,0
3,"I anticipated this dryer to be just what I was looking for but it was twice too large & heavy for my hands. I’m so disappointed because in the few areas my hands could manipulate it, my hair did just what I had hoped it would do. If you make one that does, please let me know because I’m at my wits end.",0
3,Bought in July and already smells like it’s on fire when using.  A week outside the return window 🙄,0
3,Too bulky to hold,0
3,Long and heavy to use.,0
3,NOTHING,0
3,The dryer cylinder was too big for what I intended to use it for. It was rather hot to hold and just didn’t work for me.,0
3,"Too loud. Didn't curl my hair, just blew it all around.",0
3,It is too large to use on shorter to medium length hair.,0
3,Not really for people with long thick hair.,0
3,My hair sits on mu shoulders and I have bangs.  The brush is too big for my bangs.  I had to return it.,0
3,Didn't like it; heavy and too bulky for anything other than long hair.  I returned this item.  other than that it appears to dry and curl ok but not for me.,0
3,Wasn't expecting it to be so big. Kinda bulky and heavy.,0
3,It does dry quickly.,0
3,It did dry my hair fast but my hair didn't look as smooth and shiny as I expected.,0
3,normal,0
3,Not many temparature control settings,0
3,Too big and heavy,0
3,Too bulky to use,0
3,"It is very heavy , I gave it to my Grandaughter",0
3,Too heavy to use all over head. Have only used once since buying it.,0
3,Doesn’t really wave the way you’d imagine,0
3,It’s biggest strength is smoothing hair. It doesn’t give great volume and it gets very hot.,0
3,na mal,0
3,I should have researched this more. The size of the head is way too big for my shoulder length hair.,0
3,The handle is too large abd it makes unit heavy and Gard for me to turn,0
3,Big and very heavy.,0
3,"I have loved this dryer and have been raving about it and have gotten several of my friends to buy it.  It works for me because I’m not coordinated enough to manage the brush and dryer separately.  That said, I’ve had it for 10 months and it suddenly broke on me last night.  I was so sad.  Revlon is doing a warranty replacement but I don’t get to pick my color.  That may seem trivial but I just want what I bought to work and I think if it breaks then they should replace it with the same thing.  I’m definitely not happy with that warranty policy.  Obviously it matters enough to me that I have come back here to update the review so that says something.  And the whole thing makes me question how long this one will work too.",0
3,Did not dry my thick hair at all! Took longer then a hairdryer,0
3,"I think it works ok, its meant for air dried hair I think. It takes FOREVER to dry wet hair. It would take an hour to get hair dry using this.",0
3,Could have been smaller.,0
3,"There’s a tiny lip at the top that my hair get caught under and tangles or rips out. Drying my hair takes much longer and there isn’t much curl, like I expected. Decent product but it just doesn’t do what I thought it would.",0
3,If you have long hair you will need to blow dry with regular dryer a little before using it or it will take forever to dry your hair.,0
3,No temperature adjustment and it gets soooo hot. I wish I would have bought a better one and spent more money on something that doesn’t get this hot. I would not recommend.  It works great but the heat cannot be good for your hair.,0
3,Gets too hot!!! A bit clumsy.,0
3,Ordered a bunch for Christmas presents only had one that didn’t work!,0
3,"Very loud, heavy and the unit gets too hot.",0
3,I like that my hair doesn’t get stuck in it. You can keep turning the brush without your hair falling out of it. I don’t like that it doesn’t dry my roots so my hair will be dry but not the top of my head,0
3,After 5mos of use the dryer now makes a high pitch skreeching noise for the 1st minute after turning on.,0
3,"After a couple times using,  it made hair feel heavy.",0
3,Didn’t do what it said,0
3,Didn’t see ANY sort of change in my hair!!!,0
3,Smell is ok. I have been using this for 2 months and haven’t seen much difference in my hair. Smell doesn’t stick.,0
3,When I use this..my hair became very strong..but getting lot of dandruff,0
3,Makes my scalp itch,0
3,Can't really tell this makes any sort of difference what so ever.,0
3,Caspa,0
3,Wasn’t quite what I expected,0
3,The shampoo and conditioner work like they say. I am picky when it comes to how my hair feels after washing. I really dislike my hair being staticky. I want my hair soft and not full of static. I guess it depends on what you are after. For the price I myself will try something else.,0
3,It makes my hair knottyFeels dryer now than before.,0
3,It was kinda stringy,0
3,It's OK.  If course going to use for longer than 2 days,0
3,Hair felt dry,0
3,Didn’t work not even a little,0
3,It was ok. Didn’t notice anything different from my usual shampoo. Set time is a bit to long. 5minutes for shampoo is do able 10-15 for conditioner is way to long for in the shower.,0
3,I will not purchase again,0
3,Not seeing a big difference in my hair. Have been using 3 months.,0
3,The conditioner doesn't soften my hair.  I do believe that the shampoo has a stripping effect.  I do not notice my hair being any shiner.,0
3,"It really help me with my eczema problem, my scalp is not as itchy and I see way less dry  scalp on my head, thw only thing I dont like its that the rest of my hair gets way dry and tangled, even with the conditioner.",0
3,Left my hair with a lot of tangles,0
3,It’s breaking my hair in half. Bummed:,0
3,It's not what I expected. It tangles my hair up to much.,0
3,I started using this but it doesn’t seem to meet up to its claims.,0
3,It makes my hair feel dry,0
3,Was expecting lager bottles,0
3,Feels to weighted on my hair. Like I have to really rinse to get it out of my hair. Not at all impressed. Would not buy again.,0
3,"It's too thick, I had to wash my hair multiple times to get product out. This product is not for African American hair.",0
3,Not for consumption,0
3,It really is quite thick.,0
3,Takes time. We need more time to review,0
3,It’s really heavy so use it very sparingly. I have thick hair and it’s even weighs my hair down.,0
3,Way too sticky.,0
3,I mostly used it on a section on my eyebrows that look thin. Used this every night and I'd say that It worked. Hair looks thicker now.,0
3,My husband only used the castor oil once.  We haven't use it enough to evaluate it yet.,0
3,Have not seen any result,0
3,Haven’t really noticed any difference. Been putting it on for about 2 months now...,0
3,"This is way too thick for hair applications. It's hard to rinse out even with shampoo and it leaves your hair feeling sticky and muddy which makes hair difficult to comb or brush afterwards. I haven't seen any positive effects of using this stuff and I will say for the most part it made my hair feel worse not to mention gave it massive shrinkage.I gave it 3 stars however because if you mix it in with conditioner it's a way better experience. It's good as a base to mix with other products but It is however not the reason I purchased this. I purchased it with the intention of only using this oil by itself. I don't see how this can be beneficial if it makes my hair feel yucky.I may continue experimenting with it as a base as I try to mixtures of other oils to come up with a proper consistency but based on the advertisement of using this for ""hair"" or it's mystic ""hair health"" properties I""m going to have to say this is a a bit far fetched to expect from this item and not a good reason to purchase it.",0
3,I found it cheaper at the local supercenter.,0
3,"The texture is very tick. Didn’t see the result yet , though I’m using it since a week",0
3,Not sure if it worked or not. It is difficult to spread on because it has the texture of tree sap.,0
3,It didn’t moisturize my skin and the bottle kept leaking every where so I had to throw it away,0
3,Everybody needs It’s,0
3,WOULD NOT BUT.AND DON'T USE ON HAIR,0
3,It does work somehow!,0
3,Arrived licking and almost half is gone.,0
3,It didn’t do anything,0
3,Does the job,0
3,Just started using the product so I can't give an accurate review.,0
3,To tick for my...hard to wash off.,0
3,I’ve been using it on my hair for about 2 months now but nothing noticeable yet.,0
3,Does not last all day,0
3,"Doesn’t stay long, started to fade within 3 hours of apply.",0
3,"Not smudge proof, spreads across my eyes by the end of the day.",0
3,It works just not as long as it states.,0
3,It runs after 2hours in a humid climate,0
3,I don’t see what all the hype is about.,0
3,"Little water resistance.  Very smooth color ( brown), but is hypoallergenic.",0
3,Just a regular eyeliner,0
3,A little light and patchy gunks up if you go over spots again and dries down shiny,0
3,This product is drying out to fast.,0
3,It’s ok. Prefer Stila.,0
3,It’s not 24 hrs stay,0
3,Smudges.,0
3,Average.,0
3,Not very water resistant & have to go over several times to get the black dark enough. Prob won't purchase again.,0
3,hairs on the brush bent out of place,0
3,It is not waterproof and doesn’t last long.  I had to use it several times to fix the eyeliner. I wouldn't buy it again!,0
3,For the price it’s ok... I wear contacts... I have to se another..,0
3,Eh it's too watery,0
3,"This eyeliner is waterproof in a way that if you put it on and try to wipe it off with water it will only partially come off, but it IS NOT waterproof in a way that you can go swimming or sweat even a little bit. I bought it for my vacation because the reviews were good and it actually says ""waterproof"" not ""water resistant"" which is what it really is. Also the brush/marker is too flexible making it very difficult to do winged eyeliner. I would not recommend this eyeliner at all",0
3,It’s not waterproof or smudge proof.,0
3,Product just ran when I tried outlining my eyes,0
3,I am on Airplanes all the time and the tube explodes and leaks,0
3,"I am not sure what is up with this brand. I bought one it was fine, bought another and fibers started popping out. Just got two more and one of them is doing it already?",0
3,goes on smoothly lasts for hours,0
3,I’ve had the product for a short time and it’s already coming apart and it smudges alot,0
3,Cracked after awhile,0
3,The line was thinner than I thought it would be...,0
3,Dried out really quickly,0
3,Read a ton of reviews.  Got this to replace my MAC liquid last eyeliner.  It doesn’t last as others have reviewed.  I use a primer & setting spray and it still fades away by the end of the day. Doesn’t last on oily skin.,0
3,not bad.definitely not waterproof though. got faded after 4 hours too,0
3,The product was kind of dry and was not waterproof! Will prob not purchase again!,0
3,Tip of the eyeliner started fraying and was not smooth and pointy. It was all over the place,0
3,It started flaking.,0
3,It tries but doesn't work for hooded eyes. May work for those without hooded eyes but for me it smudged like crazy.,0
3,"Its not waterproof, smears  and does not stay on all day",0
3,Blush is good but the smell was terrible like putting selfless tanner,0
3,It's okay....it does the job but the color is a bit orange. I wouldn't return it but I will not buy it again.,0
3,This product is okay . It smells nice but it doesn’t really show well on my skin type . I prefer the hoola bronzer .,0
3,I don’t smell anything. Wanted as a contour. Too orangey!!!!,0
3,It doesn't taste the same as last time,0
3,Product came without applicator inside,0
3,Not dark enough. Plus it smelled funny. Sadly I'm returning .,0
3,Made my pores look bigger,0
3,Little too light,0
3,It came brokeeeeeee !!! So dissapointed!,0
3,Really have to use a lot to show color,0
3,The color is too light for my skin.  I cannot see it.,0
3,The bronzer is very light for my skin tone. This bronzer is for light people. I am more on the brownish skin color.,0
3,Side by side my “bronzer” and “deep bronzer” are the same color... should have just kept it I guess,0
3,It was a lot more shimmery than I thought it would be. I ended up returning it.,0
3,Waaaaay too dark and almost the same as the darker shade.,0
3,ça va,0
3,"The product seems to cover ok, when you can get it to come out of the tip. There is a dial you turn and then you're supposed to tap the sponge applicator on your skin, but barely any of the product comes out.  Also, removing the seal around the cap left a very sticky residue on the bottle that I couldn't get off even with rubbing alcohol.",0
3,not much coverage,0
3,Too thick and water repellent,0
3,Not enough coverage,0
3,"The product works as expected for a concealer. However, instant age repair is a big stretch. The spongy applicator seemed to make the distribution of the concealer uneven. Used it, but won’t purchase again.",0
3,Like it but found it hard to get out.,0
3,It doesn't work for me at all.,0
3,Powder spread,0
3,Don't feel I would reorder.,0
3,"The concealer accentuated some of my texture and creases under the eye. I have sunken eyes. Not sure if I will use again. Also the applicator seems unhygienic. I know the products has many rave reviews though, my skin is just not good enough to have a flawless application of this concealer.",0
3,ditto,0
3,"Loved it, that is until it stopped turning to dispense more. I guess I'll have to break out open to use it",0
3,Maybe I should've chosen a different shade? It just didn't 'stay in place' to change the color of my 'dark circles?',0
3,I have a lot of dark spots and I can not completely cover them.  But I'm old and maybe don't know what I'm foing,0
3,Product seemed somewhat dried out- not easy to blend/spread. Flaked off easily after application.,0
3,I always use this brand but after removing the tape that seals it a sticky residue was left.,0
3,Does just an average job for coverage.  Has a tendency to crease and wear off mid-day,0
3,VERY drying,0
3,dry,0
3,I have been using this product for quite some time (2 years or more) and I gave it only a three star to make a statement that it is NOT going to cover up age spots or blemishes. I use it as a ''base'' before putting on my liquid makeup.,0
3,Much lighter than actual color displayed.,0
3,Its not thick enough,0
3,Feels and looks really thin for dark circles. Imperfections on skin dies cover up.,0
3,"It's ok, not moisturizing at all.",0
3,Dont know why but it doesnt come out ...,0
3,Not sharp enough. One use does it in.,0
3,These are not sharp...at all.,0
3,Not my favorite razor for facial skin. These don't move over skin very well. Maybe I need to get used to using the we m.,0
3,"Good beginner tool to start with if you're new to derma planing. It's good for the price. However, I think that it gets the job done but not as good as you want it to with dead skin. It is great at removing that peach fuzz around the jawline though.",0
3,Not sharp enough,0
3,Not so smooth and not so much for sensitive skin,0
3,"This product works as described for me, but really scratched up my sister who has sensitive skin.",0
3,Not that sharp.Plastic edges scratched my face.,0
3,They work,0
3,I have noticed this pulls hair a little instead of just shaving smoothly off.,0
3,It works but I don’t see how it works any different than a razor!,0
3,They are sharp but I feel they should be shorter or maybe a different shape. I find it to be big for the areas on my face.,0
3,"The pump is sturdy and reliable. However, the container is top-heavy.",0
3,Not sharp enough. Not at all moisturizing. I had to go over several times the areas I needed done. Cheap enough that I didn’t return.,0
3,I didnt like that it was hard to maneuver around my eyebrows. It left my skin a little irritated because there is just a blade.  I did like that it came in a 3 pack. I liked the price.,0
3,These are ok! I bought temporarily because I can’t get my eye brows waxed right now and they needed shaping.,0
3,My face is still sensitive after using. It got the hair off but didn’t really exfoliate. My face is raw.,0
3,"The blades will easily cut you. They are very irritating on delicate skin. But it works well,so be careful when you use it.",0
3,"Product is easy to use and helps my skin to look great. Would give 5 stars, but one of the three razors arrived broken.",0
3,I really nicked myself with these.  I don't with other brands.,0
3,These are ok. They do the job but do not last.,0
3,For face use only. Don’t use these on the coochie.,0
3,V.denger,0
3,Wasn’t what I expected,0
3,"The product seemed a little cheap in my experience with it, however it still did what I wanted I just only got one or 2 uses out of each blade.",0
3,This is my second and doesn’t work as good as the original.,0
3,Heats up after a short time.,0
3,"I'm going to keep it, but it still left enough behind that I still had to use tweezers.",0
3,Hair comes back a few days later,0
3,Worked one time,0
3,this was purchased for Mom,0
3,However…. It doesn’t really work!!! Don’t buy!,0
3,The product simply quit working despite a new battery.,0
3,It takes some work to actually remove the hair. I have to go over my face a couple of times to really see results.,0
3,it did not work,0
3,"So it works for the most part, misses some hairs here and there, but I mean its way easier than a razor  and you can safely travel with it. Problem is I have severely sensitive skin and it did make me break out, so overall I won’t be using it very much.",0
3,"OK, but anything to write home about.",0
3,Leaves visible stubble for darker hair,0
3,"This seemed to dull really quickly and I do have to go over the same spot a lot.  Although when I clean it there is always a ton of baby hairs, so it has to be working. It just has a harder time on course hair.",0
3,Do not waste your moneyIt is not what it says it isYou use it to cut off hair which it does but it grows right back in two daysIt says the hairs stay away for a week or two but that is false,0
3,It’s ok. Have to use it 3 times a day. Makes hair grow back fast  Not very smooth.,0
3,Loved this product a lot but it has recently stopped working despite new batteries. Purchased less than a year ago,0
3,Chin up,0
3,Need to got over a few times before it actually works,0
3,Was not what I expected.,0
3,"it does the job but it will stop on you, it doesn't work steady it gets caught on the hair and stings, overall it does the job you just have to be patient with it, battery is tricky you think your battery is running out all the time, for the price its good enough",0
3,Not for everyone. The sharpest go away essay.,0
3,"I can't figure out why this works on some hairs and areas and not others. I had some dark hairs removed and some that it skipped over many times. Same with light hairs. I needed several passes to get most of the hairs that it was able to get and others I had to just use something else to remove. It was very gentle on my skin at least. The battery life seemed ok but I have no idea if it's working at full capacity or not? If your skin is so sensitive that you can't use anything else, maybe try this. Otherwise I would maybe pass on it.",0
3,"This is basically a shaver, and does not give a very close shave.",0
3,"Does not take off the hairs,  after using it, stil able to pluck off single hairs.",0
3,"Used it for my chin. It worked. But 2 days later, there alot was stubble.",0
3,"It was great while it lasted. (About a month) It slipped from my hand and fell into my sink. From that point on, it seemed to work, it sounded and vibrated like it worked but didn’t.  So I’d say it’s worth the money as long as you aren’t prone to dropping things. Once you drop it, it’s broken.",0
3,Didn’t really get the hair as it claims .,0
3,"Maybe I do not have enough facial hair, but it seemed like I had to leave on my face longer than the demo videos I found. Somewhat worked but I still can see some hairs, waxing ends up being better/faster in my opinion. The only downside is its more painful to wax. Glad this was not too expensive, will use it but will still be waxing when I can.",0
3,Does not remove hair,0
3,Works but cheaply made. I dropped it and it feel apart.,0
3,Works OK.,0
3,Burns your skin doesn't work,0
3,Smell,0
3,Did the job but was STINKYYYYY,0
3,"It worked only ok. I had to open up windows, light candles, turn on the vent in an attempt to get rid of the smell. I just left that side of the house for a while. It lingered for so long. I will not be doing that again.",0
3,"Pros:Smooth skin, hair removed, and no burning sensation.Affordable.Cons:Sulfur from the pits of hell have invaded your bathroom - this smell is like a trash bag full of rotten eggs bursting onto the floor - and likely your whole house; it permeates for hours and lingers in your nose canals. It has a god awful smell, but it works.Otherwise:I prefer veet, it's more expensive, but the smell is subtle in comparison; instead it has a slight chemical smell which is nothing compared to the overpowering sulfur smell.Not for everyone, but if you can stand the smell, then it'll save you some money.",0
3,"If you have thick, course hair, then it doesn’t work as well. I left it on over the time amount recommended and it still did I not take off the hair on my legs.",0
3,Can't really get past the smell. Also it burns if you have sensitive skin.,0
3,See above. Use for facial moisturizer.,0
3,I feel some burning when applying salicylic acid beforehand.,0
3,It was not as expected. It is very watery and does not moisturize.,0
3,My product didn't come sealed shut. How do I know it wasn't used?,0
3,It was ok. Not as motorizing as I thought!,0
3,An average moisturizer.,0
3,If I didn't open the product I would have sent it back,0
3,It not have a seal on it when I opened it it looked used,0
3,"At first this felt a little sticky on my skin, then after 3 days, my skin seemed extremely dry!It doesn’t work for me. Not for every day use in my opinion.",0
3,Not as much moisture as I thought!,0
3,I bought it in April 2021 and it expires in July 2021 ...,0
3,Made me break out more,0
3,"for my skin, It's not as moisturizing as described",0
3,Moisture did not last long. Skin was very dry after it dried up. The scent was a little much I wasn’t aware it had a scent that’s on me. Umm smooth Nd light,0
3,"The product seems to be really thin, and left my skin sort of dry and a little sticky. Could be better formulated in my opinion. Guess I’ll stick with Cerave",0
3,Product was not sealed!!!,0
3,I’ve used this for about 30 days and haven’t noticed any difference. May e it’s just me.,0
3,"Bought this product in July, no scent, used it all, and loved it. Recently I bought another however now it has a scent? It’s the same exact product which is strange. Not a fan of the scent.",0
3,It burns my skin n it has to many chemicals,0
3,I will never order another product that uses so much disposable plastic that has so little product. Cone on people!,0
3,"Item seems correct, but is from another country- I cant read  the labels or confirm authenticity.",0
3,"The box came kinda beat up, the shrink wrap was ripped and the lid wasn't closed tightly. Possibly a return?But I looked at unboxing videos and saw that there wasn't a paper/plastic lining to seal the opening of the jar and it looked the correct quantity.",0
3,Dried my skin out,0
3,Why is it called a moisturizer ? My skin does not feel it . It gets dried up fast and then i need to put more on !,0
3,It makes my skin soft but it burns.,0
3,I did not receive what I was expecting. This product has fragrance in it.,0
3,Only gave 3 stars as when i had recieved this the lid wasnt on right so half of it was in the box and unusable,0
3,I can't really tell any difference,0
3,Skin still feels too dry after application. Not that moisturizing.,0
3,This gel formed clot. Wasn’t very smooth for my skin.,0
3,"I dont see any results, even after 2 months",0
3,Didn't do anything but stain clothes and cause acne,0
3,Actually I don’t see any thing different on my skin. I have use it for many years,0
3,Waiting to see results,0
3,"It was an okay product, I used it nightly. Didn’t cause a reaction which is great, but also didn’t necessarily improve my skin in any way.",0
3,Different color/smell than Walmart bought bottle.,0
3,It hasn’t helped prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy,0
3,I have been using this product on my belly area for stretch marks since I was pregnant and now I felt a little bit different than the one I used to use.,0
3,I wanted to like this product but the scent is just gross. Like an old woman's perfume. Used it for a week and switched to Dove.,0
3,"used it for 2 months , don't see much of a difference",0
3,First time trying it,0
3,Still got stretch marksUsed it everyday,0
3,I haven’t noticed any change in appearance of three different scars I have (two on knees and one on arm),0
3,"I used this for months and I do not think it made a difference in any of my stretch marks or scars. Keep in mind they are all barely noticeable as is, but i really thought that since they were so light there would be a drastic difference. I don't know if i would buy this again. I also did not enjoy the smell - its weird and strong",0
3,I have been using it for my leg scars and haven’t really seen a difference. I’ve been using the product for a month,0
3,I used this product while pregnant and still got stretch marks. I used it twice a day and felt moisturized but still got some stretch marks.,0
3,This is not the real bio oil.,0
3,"I have yet to notice any difference on my stretch marks, been using everyday morning and night for about 2 months",0
3,It seems to break me out a little.,0
3,Returned,0
3,It might cause allergy,0
3,Still waiting for final three months of use to provide full detailed review.,0
3,Not have used it much,0
3,Still waiting for results.,0
3,The product box seal was already ripped open when I recieved it. Other than that the wrap on the bottle itself was still on,0
3,"I don’t know if it’s actually diminishing my stretch marks, but it feels very luxurious.",0
3,I don’t see a change yet and have been using a few times a week and putting on with socks and sleeping with them...,0
3,Need to use them for couple days to see results and not working on all acnes.,0
3,"For pimples,etc",0
3,Acne Pimple Patch does not cure face Pimple after using it.,0
3,I have used the product only for 2 days and don’t have enough time/usage to rate it.,0
3,Didn't work as expected.,0
3,Didn't work for me,0
3,"Not the earth shattering product I expected. It works well for some things. A pimple beneath the skin - it will usually bring it to the surface. It did not do much for white heads or blackheads. Very limited use, in my opinion",0
3,"It helped a little. If you get pimples every once in awhile I can see purchasing them, but if it’s more than that, I don’t see why.",0
3,As I have sensitive skin this acne pimple product did not work for me,0
3,Some worked but most of the time they didn’t do anything. I’d suggest a different brand,0
3,I wore many acne patches before but these don’t seem to do much. They really dry out my acne and if you wear make up then you’ll have a lot of dry patches on your skin.,0
3,Used it on acne in different areas.  It did not work at all.  I also found the same product at our local Dollar Tree.,0
3,"It didn’t work for me didn’t do anything for my acne, may have just not worked for me but may work for someone else",0
3,Worked as needed,0
3,Didn’t work out for my skin.,0
3,The product worked to cover the zit but minimal absorption,0
3,"Feels small and flimsy..... doesn't slide well.....and ""right clicks"" in the middle of it all....",0
3,I need to take my mouse around with me for work and it’s an auto shut off. It ends up staying on in my bag for a long time. I’m just going to use it at home.,0
3,Didn't look the same as in the picture.,0
3,It will do for what I need to do,0
3,I thought it would be more flat.Good price,0
3,I bought 4 of these mice.  One malfunctioned 1 week after the return date expired.,0
3,Lasted a few months then it became useless. You get what you pay for.. price wise.,0
3,Much smaller than I thought it would be,0
3,Does not have on and off button,0
3,Cant find the off switch and have burned through multiple batteries.,0
3,I wanted something pink but this was a bit toyish for me.,0
3,Bigger then expected. Very light in weight,0
3,does the job,0
3,The scrolling is eradicate,0
3,Did not connect to my windows laptop but works with my sons. I didn’t have the time to figure out why I wouldn’t work.,0
3,"When not in use for a while, it doesn’t “wake up” very quickly.",0
3,works.,0
3,The middle roller doesn’t scroll the page up or down,0
3,I needed an adapter - mouse is not readily made for Apple devices.,0
3,Does not have a on/off switch,0
3,The mouse is quiet - clicks and scroll - but the accuracy is a bit lacking (which is expected for a device of this price).  My only pet peeves (aside from the accuracy) is that it goes into auto-sleep mode when not in use (I prefer to have a on/off button) and the plastic battery compartment opening piece is slightly loosely fitted so it makes some noises whenever you move your mouse.,0
3,You need batteries for this.,0
3,The mouse moved too slow.,0
3,Basic mouse. Nothing fancy about it.,0
3,Works but cheap looking.,0
3,The mouse pointer moves uncontrollablely.,0
3,"I like the quiet click, but it doesn't have an on/off button. And, sometimes it is hard to get it to click on something especially after it hasn't been used for an hour or so.",0
3,"it works as a mouse, but it cannot be turned off without manually taking out the battery.",0
3,"Apparently it is for ""lefties"".  I have to do all functions backwards, left clicks are right clicks and vice versa.",0
3,Gets the job done considering I don’t need it much but feels very cheaply made. I’ve only had mine for about a week so we will see how long it will last.,0
3,Quieter then my regular mouse but not completely silent.,0
3,"It does not have an on/off switch. I tried letting it sit & close the computer, but the mouse stayed on. You have to remove the battery each time",0
3,It works. Cheaply made but for a cheap price,0
3,The little cap on the thing u plug into the computer fell off so it reviled the chip card thing and it never worked again and we had this for only two weeks.,0
3,Decided on wireless,0
3,This product does not work with my IOS devices.,0
3,"The mouse kept messing up on me.  After 3 months, I had to replace it.  I will not buy this name brand again.",0
3,Got this for my sons Chromebook and it is often glitchy.,0
3,Cheaply made - uncomfortable fit,0
3,These are way bigger on the face than I excepted . My face looks so tiny with these on.,0
3,Little cheap look,0
3,I am sensitive to light and easily get headaches/migraines. These did not improve that for me and I can't tell that they are actually anti-glare or not.,0
3,Watching tv at night and computer work at night,0
3,Light weight,0
3,they’re smudged and the smudges won’t come off,0
3,I didn’t notice a difference even with the blue light testing tool that they sent with it ..I may use these frames for my real glasses,0
3,"Sleep quality? Why is that a review category?Otherwise, I don't see/feel a difference wearing these. Also they a little tight on my face",0
3,"Bought it cheap, and it look cheap but works for what it suppose to do.",0
3,I couldn't wear them for long periods of time.,0
3,The product didn’t do what it said it would do,0
3,One of my pairs are really loose. One sides won't stay sturdy and I never had any damage to them.,0
3,I just don’t notice a difference when I wear these glasses.  They seem very lightweight and cheap.,0
3,"They do what they say, I just personally can't stand the look of them.",0
3,It was more of just a fashion item,0
3,I don't find that it gives me much glare protection.,0
3,"If you have a narrow face, these are huge.Super cute-just entirely too big for my face.",0
3,I put the test paper up to my computer screen and it never changed the paper to that purple color. I guess my screens are already equipped with the blocker and I didn't need to buy these glasses after all.,0
3,Can't really tell if it's making any difference,0
3,Too heavy continuously wearing it.,0
3,Nothing else to say,0
3,The mouse often just moves by itself.,0
3,"Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing",0
3,"Laptop is decent, I’ve had it for just under a year and the mouse doesn’t work",0
3,"It’s ok, it crashed chrome as soon as I downloaded it",0
3,"This is really great laptop but by design it is meant to slow down performance when on battery power which is normal for many laptops, however either Acer or AMD makes it WAY too slow for that and unlike some laptops there is no setting provided that allows you to change this.",0
3,it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse,0
3,Returned laptop. The baccklit keyboard keeps turning off. Droveme nutz,0
3,Within 6 months of purchase the monitors hinge has pulled away from the screen.,0
3,"I actually like this computer. It's lite, fast enough to meet my needs, and the touchpad works as well as a Macbook.The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is due to the fact there is no CAP lock indication of any kind. No light on the key itself, nothing on the screen, no warning when you start to enter a password that the cap are on, nothing.I'm sick of entering password incorrectly because I don't know if the caps are locked on. This may not be an issue for some, so if it isn't go ahead and purchase this one. However, I would caution you that it really is a pain and with almost everything you do being online and all the different requirements for password from simple to complex, it really is quite cumbersome.",0
3,Bought this and had a question about the computer was told it was out of warranty. How can that be?  Three day warranty what the heck. I would look elsewhere for a computer.,0
3,Charging cord is shot and I haven’t been had it 3 months.,0
3,Overheats,0
3,It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity.,0
3,built in camera and mic not working,0
3,"This is a very basic computer, it really shouldn't be used for streaming or gaming, because it just frankly cannot keep up. And now my touch pad doesn't work so I have to contact ACER to have them fix it. I haven't even had the computer a year yet.",0
3,"The batter life is trash, and heats up fast",0
3,Battery time is about 1.5 hrs,0
3,Bought it in June now August and is already slow to load and I haven’t even downloaded anything to it,0
3,Nothing fancy but does what I need.,0
3,Slowww.,0
3,I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time,0
3,Chrome OS doesn’t work for many software apps etc.  could not connect to many programs. Going back to a PC. Probably works for kids but not for “grown up “ who needs more than YouTube or social media.,0
3,"Was to small for what I wanted it for, returned and got a bigger one.",0
3,Great buy - we needed a Laptop for simple projects.We both found the computer NOT user friendly - not good for the our senior environment.Still learning.,0
3,Screen was smaller then I expected. Touch pad not touch screen !!!!!!,0
3,I need a book that explains to me how to use it!,0
3,"False advertising in reference to the backlit keyboard. It does NOT have that. Speakers are not loud at all so if you dont have headphones or a quiet space, it can be inconvenient.Good for the basic computer needs.",0
3,"Functional laptop, but not as described.",0
3,What I expected,0
3,THE PROCESSOR IS NOT 2.8GHZ IT IS ONLT 1.3-1.4 GHZ IT IS SLOW.....,0
3,"Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard.",0
3,"its to long for touch screen to recognize touch... needs bluetooth mouse or keyboard for instant reaction, unless it can be reprogrammed for sensitivity,  would be 5 star all around, nerve wrecking..",0
3,"I can’t install apps for my LG home appliances even though they are available for Samsung Phones, but not the tablet.",0
3,"It keeps taking me to other places, puts spaces between letters, jumps around, etc. Returning.",0
3,What do I do the screen  cracked inside,0
3,"So far, not impressed...tablet has updated at least 3 times since I received it less than 24 hours ago.",0
3,"Very slow, press an app and go make a cocktail. By the time you return it will most likely have loaded.",0
3,"This is my second Galaxy and I found this one to be alot slower, the screen is not nearly as sensitive to touch and the color and screen quality are not the same. I got this one because my first one wouldn't charge after 14 months but I have terrible luck with electronics anyway.",0
3,It is slow,0
3,Unless you are only looking to do some light internet browsing and document preparation I suggest that you get something other than a chromebook.,0
3,Cant really do much with this... if you only need to use the internet then that works.... cant download anything.,0
3,Too small,0
3,"This product is not 2.64lbs, it is 2.9lbs",0
3,Very sensitive a pad. Impossible to use. Have to get the mouse to work with this laptop...,0
3,Like the touch screen except for scrollingCame with ZERO instructions.  Which did not make it easy.,0
3,After 6 Months some keys are not working. I am searching on Amazon to see if there are any replacements sold but I cant find any. I don't see any where I can connect to the manufacturer to buy a replacement. Also there is a glitchy look when watching movies from Netflix. I don't have that issue when I am watching the same movie on my phone which is a low end ZTE. That means that the quality sucks when watching netflix. I don't know how to fix that. Another issue which I have noted is that after the first two months the response time for turn on has slowed significantly. So normally when I open the Chromebook its takes about a second to come on but now it take like 20 seconds to power on. Apart from those three issues (which are somewhat major) the Chromebook seems to work fine.,0
3,I  do not recommend this chromebook. sometimes it works as it should other times it does not. The front size is smalland when you increase the size then it runs off the page.  I am going to go back to an HP product.This is just to unreliable.,0
3,Its kinda wack its just a tablet with a key pad,0
3,Was fast at first. Two months later it’s slowing down a lot.,0
3,I have to learn too many new things in operating this system.,0
3,Slow and far away from being a laptop!,0
3,This is my first Chromebook....I found the screen too smallIt does simple simple to navigate,0
3,"I absolutely love my surface pro 7, but its been a year an a half since I've bough it and the battery doesn't last more than three hours (on battery saver mode). For me, this is a problem because I move around a lot and it gets very annoying having to carry the charger everywhere I go. Part of the reason I decided to go with the surface was because of its portability and ""long lasting"" battery. If it wasn't for this issue id be giving it a five star review because of its amazing performance, but sadly, this is not the case.",0
3,Flash drive is not read when connected using usb c. It works when I use a usb c adapter with usb.,0
3,very small size and high storage but there is not click to lock in the usb slider so when inserting into a computer the usb a or c port will often retract back into the drive instead of going into the female end,0
3,Does not work if u have a case on your phone.,0
3,Needs a key ring.,0
3,Made for windows only,0
3,I have to take the case off my phone to use it.  It should have a smaller profile so it works with a case on the phone. Also it gets hot.  Why?,0
3,this USB gets hot after transfer 3-4 video files,0
3,It gets really hot when in use.,0
3,Its little flimsy. Actually mobiles that have usb c comes with an adapter themselves and kinda make this product redundant.,0
3,The only downfall to this is the hole to clip to is right in the center so it is not streamline as it hangs on my keychain.,0
3,5GB write 60MB/s with 3.1 Type-C.Type-A? ∱∪ↅϏ..,0
3,feels cheap and overheats all the time,0
3,write speed is 20mb/s maximum,0
3,The second one I purchased is marked 64GB but it is only 32 GB. It is marked 64 GB.,0
3,"Little expensive compared to other metal/rugged ones in Cost/GB. Bought regardless because it had Type-C connector. Its a average flash drive, as connectors look and feel little flimsy as if it would fall apart soon.",0
3,"most of the time. Frequently has issues with the standard USB side, but none on he USB-C side, which I use more frequently.",0
3,"I like this flash with the added USB-C port.  It is perfect for moving data between the kids' Macs and other PCs.  Unfortunately the material/workmanship is cheap.  The slider used to extend the connector fails regularly.  Once snapped into place, it will fail and the exposed connector will collapse when inserting into the receiving USB port.  So you must hold the the slider while inserting--a minor annoyance.  The entire flash drive feels a little cheap--not bad but not what I was expecting from SanDisk.  Otherwise, the drive functions well is is a fair deal.",0
3,Decent product does wat it is intended to do,0
3,Feels cheap,0
3,Considerably slower than the 32gb version I already owned.  Not sure if it is due to increased capacity or not.,0
3,A 3 star because it has a very small & impossible  space to attach to your key ring,0
3,Decent for the price,0
3,The drive works as a transfer between my laptop and phone. My big issue is I need to remove the phone case to insert the drive into the phone.,0
3,"It is made really flimsy, and it does not stay in when it is placed in USB port.  Not what I expected from San Disk.",0
3,the switch know is not that smooth,0
3,Not much speed W\R,0
3,This device is heating very fast,0
3,Gets Heated,0
3,Storage capacity is less than whats written on it.It gets heatedup while transferring files,0
3,Very slow....I didn't expected this one...While copying 1gb file it's taking a lot of time in mobile.....,0
3,Gets really hot when in use. Starts a transfer quickly but gets slower and slower throughout,0
3,Practico,0
3,Transfer speed is veey lowwwww😣😣,0
3,Data tranfer speed is very slow takes more than  half an hour for 15 gb tranfer...,0
3,Heats up very early,0
3,Speed not as expected,0
3,"Device consistently disconnects from the Xbox, kicking me out of games downloaded to it.",0
3,Xbox doesn't always recognize it upon start up I have to unplug it and plug it back i,0
3,Was almost 2TB,0
3,Speeds are very slow,0
3,Literally only 1tb,0
3,"Good size, decent price, horrible speeds. Xbox one, Xbox One s, and Xbox One X, All tried with this HDD. All continuously disconnect randomly. And yes, I've tried changing start-up and power options, to no avail.",0
3,I recieved the seagate harddrive thinking that I would get 4 Terabytes but only to get 3.6 terabytes. Not what I paid for.,0
3,Was 1.81tb  Capacity.,0
3,Works as ordered.,0
3,I need to manually reconnect usb each time I turn on Xbox. It works but not without issues.,0
3,When plugged in has 1.8T instead of 2T that I was looking for,0
3,I could not connect to my Mac. But connects to my xbox,0
3,Na,0
3,"It works, wasn't 1TB though. Was really about 700Gb-ish",0
3,Don't buy for a PlayStation 4 system. It's too old of a model. I need a 3.0 and this is not up to date.,0
3,I always have to unplug it and plug it back in for me to access my games,0
3,"When i ""backed"" up my pc and laptop all that is on the portable hard drive, are empty file folders. Granted, the names on the folders match both the pc and laptop",0
3,"The side of the included USB cable that connects to the drive itself is incredibly wobbly, and if moved even slightly has a tendency to become unplugged and interrupt backups. It also writes quite slowly. It works well as a backup drive, but it's too slow to use as a functional external drive, and the inconsistent connection makes it impossible to use while on the go.",0
3,Only got 1tb and I paid the 2tb.,0
3,Needs a passcode. Regards Jim,0
3,It’s very slow but it came brand new.,0
3,"Arrived on may 15, 2020. worked well until 2 weeks later the drive stop lighting up. won't buy again. tried everything.",0
3,"I formatted it exFAT so I can use on pc and mac, though I use a macbook pro 2017 mostly. And this drive has been a nightmare. If the cord so much as gets bumped (which is often the case), it will come unplugged. You get the little pop up message saying it ejected without doing it officially. Normally, I just plug something back in. But no, not this dude. It's grayed out in DISK UTILITY. I can't mount or unmount it. It won't ""eject"" through THAT menu. Iiterally have to restart my computer over a dozen times...and try various things such as ... plugging it in first, then restarting. Then trying to wait to plug in until it's restarted. I do a handful of things, different each time, and when i'm about to chuck it, it will suddenly work. I'm so over it. I need to get a new drive now so I can copy everything off of this one (if it ever loads again)...as I'm on restart 14 this time.... the 5th time it's happened in the past month because my cat jumped up to lie down on the warm laptop. I'm over it. The last SeaGate drive I owned just stopped working--i tried everything. And then when I invested another $400 in a diff drive and spent a fortune trying to get all my files downloaded from my off-site server (BackBlaze, which is another cluster F of epic proportions)...after a month of tedious, time-consuming stuff, suddenly, it started working again. WHAT THE??? So back to toshiba or Western Digital I go.",0
3,"So I got it, I download my old game to it, I try to play it, and my system said it's no more space I have to delete something.  But it's on the portable drive though?",0
3,its only 1.8 tb not 2 tb,0
3,Transfer speed is slower than a HDD I bought 5 years ago. My old HDD was a complete dinosaur....,0
3,I just recently purchased the 2TB one for my PS4 1TB. I received it within 2 days of my purchase and quickly connected it to my PS4 and followed the instructions. When it finally came out on my storage on PS4 it wasn’t 2TB. It shows only 918.4GB?????????,0
3,Very slow read and write speeds. USB 3.0 isn't even needed.,0
3,The package inside was already open.  I'm wondering if it's used.,0
3,For some reason Beyond drive I'm copying movies from is faster than the one I just bought and it's still a Seagate,0
3,Wont always stay connected/ seen by pc. I have to re connect usb sometimes for pc to see drive,0
3,Has 1.7 TB instead of the 2 TB seller claims to have.,0
3,"I bought this in december and when it arrived I read comments saying itll format when plugged in but it didnt for me it said ""cannot format this usb device as extended storage. "" I bought the 4tb one I had to do the exFAT to use the usb.",0
3,Making beeping sounds.. is that usual?,0
3,beeps and clicks a lot. it's SMR.avoid.,0
3,quality ad price,0
3,This item was open package and used.,0
3,It works but It isn't silent,0
3,Didn’t come with any cable’s,0
3,I am a big fan of Seagate and their various HDDs which are still the most practical and least expensive for large storage.  Unfortunately this drive seems slow and choppy in performance and didn't benchmark well over older WD Black or WD Blue drives - will keep it all the same for the price but not happy with the purchase.,0
3,I could not load it on my computer and returned it,0
3,"No cable, no instructions. Youtube install how to do videos.  But item is as described and stores data.",0
3,"Not that fast, and takes long time to wake up.. about 10 seconds. while my nas drive 2 seconds",0
3,DOES NOT COME WITH A SATA CABLE. Set my build back about a day due to this.,0
3,"I ordered 4 of these drives for 4 different systems. These drives are loud in terms of spindle noise, its almost like these are refurbished devices. I also noticed a power issue with them during restarts, the drives don't seem to want to restart properly and hang. I would expect this in a Video system or server environment however a desktop environment is completely different. I would not advise that this be used as a primary drive. These would be questionable as even back up drives.I had an issue where one of these drives was reported as completely failed after only the third time being used.I used this as a secondary drive in the system partnered with a primary SSD drive and still experienced diminished operation.Do yourself a favor and avoid the headache that I had and save up for an SSD.",0
3,slightly smaller storage than advertised but its under 20gbs which for the amount of space I use its not noticeable atm,0
3,"Didnt give me all 3 tb, only gave me 2",0
3,No installation information.. not even the usual screws that come with a new hardrive.. no mounting bracket.. glad I know how to install components.. next time will purchase local or from Newegg so it comes in original packaging with hardware.,0
3,I ordered it assuming it had a cable but silly me never assume,0
3,Just use it for Backup.,0
3,Bios recognizes it but software won't Sent back first one to try again.,0
3,so so,0
3,The corners of the case cracked for some reason after trying to put them on my computer...hope they did not scratch my computer.,0
3,keyboard thing keeps slipping off and case started to break after a couple of months,0
3,Does not show Apple logo,0
3,A few days of use and had a lot of scratches..bad material,0
3,The cover is fine and all but the rest of the products are trash except the little bag. The keyboard cover isn't perfect since you can't even see the lights for the letters and its doesn't align with them. The screen protector was hard to put on since one of the tags to remove the plastic didn't even work and it was very easy to get bubbles in. Would just the cover tbh.,0
3,"The case is okay, but my main issue is that the keyboard cover doesn’t line up. I got the correct one, but the letters don’t match up with the backlit ones on the cover. I have double vision trying to type. The symbols on the cover also dont match the ones on the keyboard. I had to buy another one :/",0
3,"Is very flimsy, you get what you paid for.",0
3,when i got this case the bottom piece was very easy to put on but the top piece was more difficult. i’m not sure what was wrong but i think a piece was broken off and that’s why it wasn’t attaching to the top of my computer. overall i think it’s worth it but you can definitely find better cases,0
3,The keypad cover images do not match the actual keyboard images,0
3,shows fingerprints,0
3,mine cracked after a few weeks,0
3,Unfortunately doesn’t fit the laptop. It does look cool and the other versions of it worked well.,0
3,"Overall the keyboard and top cover fits like a glove. It is very durable, however the base section just did not work with the top cover. It restricted the Screen from opening beyond 90 degrees. The issue is both the upper cover and lower (left hand corner), cover touches and creates resistance in opening. This could eventually cause structural damage to the computer screen. Unfortunately I had to return the product. Good cover, but conflict in the back must be resolved.",0
3,It cracked,0
3,The top cover catches all of the fingerprints and is hard to wipe off so now I have fingerprint stains all over the top so it doesn’t look clean.,0
3,not what I expected,0
3,screen protector broken but the rest was fine,0
3,"This was a replacement because there was a scratch on the cover on the original order. Unfortunately, the replacement one also had visible marks on the cover. Have to return and try another brand or type of cover.",0
3,"Used it for a while. Easy to snap in the cover and also like the color. But it shows the fingerprints everywhere on the cover, which I don’t like.",0
3,This is called Serenity Blue but it is purple.,0
3,3 tiny little fans barely move air past the surface...I expected that kind of performance from a $10 pad with fewer reviews than this one...,0
3,Little bulky and needs some type of gripping material otherwise laptop slides off.,0
3,"So today marks 6 months exactly since I got this product, and during that time I have used it almost every day. It works great for the most part, but the USB connectors have now broken twice. I was able to repair it the first time, but the second time one of the components straight up broke. So yeah, that's what happens after 6 months of use I guess...",0
3,"After 6 months, the noise started and it’s loud.",0
3,not really work to my laptop,0
3,It's very light but I can barely feel the air blowing,0
3,"It's really quiet, but doesn't do a great job at actually keeping my laptop cool (i7 CPU, nvidia1050 graphics card) with heavy use. The backlight is bright enough to see your keyboard well.Also, the pad itself needs one of its USB ports to connect to the laptop, so you only get one extra. And the included USB port doesn't work too well with devices with a high bitrate, like storage drives, monitors, or sound drivers—I ended up just connecting the pad itself to a new usb hub and not using its extra port.Ok for casual use, not great for gaming.",0
3,the smell makes me feel headache,0
3,After a month and a half one of the fans started getting slow and making too much noise.,0
3,"This product has a nice design, but it is noisy due to the fan motors' obsolete technology. Those fans use single-phase brushless DC motors, and they have rough commutation processes. So the fans make ticking noises as they turn due to the commutations the motors make. This product should use three-phase brushless motors for the fans, which run smoother and generate a lot less noise during commutation processes.",0
3,One of the fans didn't work when I plugged it in but it is still doing the job for now,0
3,Estandar.,0
3,The heat dissipation is minimal,0
3,"So everyone is aware; one of the pics has ""On/Off switchable LED light""; which is why i bought this; the on off button is for the light AND the fans...i really wanted to run the fans without the lights.",0
3,"My laptop would not stay in place on the surface, it kept sliding down.  You have to have the feet extended to lift it up for air circulation but the slant then causes the laptop to keep sliding.  I had to buy some ""sticky"" buttons and put them on the cooling pad to keep the computer in place.",0
3,Laptop overheats as though it's not there,0
3,"Have had this for a little over a year now, since then two of the fans have gone out.. expected it to last longer than that...",0
3,"It's big for a 2020 MacBook pro 13, you'll feel the MacBook sliding and moving inside the case.",0
3,"I order a 14"" and It's 4 finger bigger than my computer:/",0
3,"Bought 13.3"" . It is way too big for late 2020 m1 macbook air.",0
3,"The quality seems ok, but the color wine red doesn't correspond to the photo.",0
3,Color was not as pictured it’s more of a light and soft red,0
3,It’s more pink than red in color. Not what I imagined the color being.,0
3,I returned this one and kept the one I ordered with a handle.  The material is a bit thin also on this one.,0
3,Color i picked was way off what i got.,0
3,"Material was not what I expected, feels a little cheap but overall does the job. Water resistant, soft insides, and enough room for my iPad Air and keyboard plus some accessories in the front pouch.",0
3,“Wine red “ isnt red its a pink raspberry colour,0
3,It is big in size for 13 inch MacBook Pro,0
3,Came so dented and with a stain on it,0
3,I purchased this in wine- it come in and it is pink almost fuchsia colored.,0
3,way too big,0
3,Its much larger than my brand new mac book pro.,0
3,Muy grande para la Mac Air 2019Too big for a Mac Air 2019,0
3,"It didn’t last for too long, the zipper tore down",0
3,Not as sturdy,0
3,"I bought the 13-inch case for my 13-inch MacBook and it was way too big. There’s so much more room then I was wanting, at least a couple inches, if not more. My computer slides around in the case, even with my ipad in the case along with it.",0
3,Bigger than expected,0
3,"Wine red color isn’t accurate, it’s pink",0
3,The WiFi signal doesn’t reach very far at all.  A lot less than advertised,0
3,Extended Wifi  signalNo feedback from personSo unable to rate,0
3,Didn't reach as far as I wanted.,0
3,I still have it but don’t see a difference in the area I placed it for my WiFi,0
3,Did not magnify my Wi-Fi signal that much; can't really tell the difference before I got this extender.,0
3,"Works ok, signal goes in and out,  it all depends where you put it",0
3,See rating,0
3,I can't tell if helped with the speed,0
3,Does not live up to its advertisement,0
3,It would not work with my camera,0
3,Don't think it helped at all... maybe a tad,0
3,It’s works when it wants to.,0
3,"I bought two of these and placed them around a two story house using the Tether App to locate the best positions. Using the OneMesh service with an Archer A7 router, there is now full signal nearly everywhere in the house.However, this comes at the cost of half bandwidth. 200mbps down from the main router, but if a device connects to the extender, it cuts the speed in half to about 70-120mbps. Tested using speedofme and speedtest by ookla. I feel this should be something stated clearly. Mildly annoyed there aren't many reviews mentioning this and I had to go to reddit to find other people noticing this. For the relatively cheap price, I wasn't expecting a seamless extension of the network, but half speed?It's a choice between a stable connection with slower speeds or keep low signal at higher speeds.",0
3,Back and forward always.,0
3,You have to make an online account with the manufacturer to set it up.  What kind of garbage is that?,0
3,Spotty wifi,0
3,This does not work thru Stine walls.,0
3,Doesn’t work,0
3,"It's just ok, nothing to write home about. Maybe my router is too far or I'm expecting more from this wifi booster then I should, but it disconnects fairly often and it's main purpose is to provide wifi to one room with a smart TV which it intermittently fails to do. When it does work, it's a toss up between slow or nothing.",0
3,"Returned because I couldn't get it to work, it may have just been me.",0
3,Doesn’t work as expected.,0
3,It does not work for games on internet,0
3,WiFi Signal,0
3,i have Gigabyte internet but the extender only pushes out 100mbps speed.,0
3,Not sure it is working as well as expected right outside the bedrooms and my kids need to come out into the hall to get a connection,0
3,"Didn't do much, if anything.",0
3,"The extender works for the most part if you are one person using it. I live in a house with other college students and the extender provides really weak signal once there's 2 or more people needing to do online class or watching tv. The extender has a ""location helper"" and it says it's in an optimal location in respect to its distance from the router. The extender also simply stops working multiple times a day. I have to unplug it and plug it back in for it to start working again. I'm disappointed because of the high reviews and thousands of purchases and I've been let down.",0
3,Did not see much difference,0
3,I don’t think spectrum cable is compatible with this product.,0
3,"The signal is not that great.Every day I enter the area and look at the device plugged into the wall, all of the lights are off.  I have to unplug it and plug it back in.  It will reconnect to the router and will work for the remainder of the day.Strange behavior.  I think I will be buying something else today to replace the device.",0
3,"It's an wifi extender for cheap. it's ok, but my 5G channel that is 500 Mbps download on the main router only get 50 Mbps on the extender ... so it only ok.",0
3,Why do they need to get on your phone?,0
3,Did not do what I expected.,0
3,COULDNT GET IT TO WORK FOR ME.,0
3,Goes on and off constantly,0
3,It only helped my tv by about 30 percent more. So I still went many nights without wifi in my room.  Our home is about 1900 square ft and the modem is at the middle and the plug was in between.,0
3,couldn't get it to work.,0
3,Won’t connect at 1gb with xfinity XB7 gateway using 80 foot cat 5e cable. Cat 5e should work up to 100 meters (300+ feet).The 8 port version works ok.,0
3,"Hi bought this to use with a Voip phone at work that doesn't have a direct power cable to the phone, (i.e. it uses power from the internet connection to operate) and found that it didn't supply the power needed to operate the phone.",0
3,"inside the manufacturers box was a plastic bag with someone's used, old, dry chewing gum.so, now i don't know what was supposed to be in the plastic bag, if anything.other than that, the product seems to work as advertised.",0
3,All ports do not work,0
3,"Needed to replace it after 7 months. Just quit, went down and could even ping or access it.",0
3,I bought this thinking it would have wan port in back but it works for what its needed for,0
3,It has lots of features nut no SNMP.  Bummer.,0
3,Had to return no longer needed. Have this item already in use. It works extremely well.,0
3,Tecnically is a 4 port switch because you have to use one port to connect it to the router.,0
3,Does its job,0
3,Functions,0
3,Keeps having to reset.,0
3,Works as expected but seems to stall to slow speeds at times.  Spent a  little time analyzing the issue but found nothing to indicate why.  It was a bargain price and I would buy it again,0
3,This is European Branded power. Beware when buying.,0
3,Fast service and Works as described,0
3,"It works, couple of issues with the web interface and the fact that the unit wants to be on the same subnet as the router.",0
3,"I have internet issues sometimes, and I think the switch just needs to be power-cycled.  Other than that it is a standard switch and ""just works"".  Although I needed to configure it the first time I used it.",0
3,"Not sure whats going on with this device..  My games start messing up and having issues when I plugged both my computers and modem into it. I ended up taking my computer out and hooking directly up to the modem again.. Only use it when I need to copy data between computers as my computers are both in a room far away from the single run I have to the modem. it works fine for simple internet and transfers, but my games had all kinds of issues with it.",0
3,Beware! You can manage it only via Windows machine!,0
3,"The ports are on one side - the power goes in the other. Had I investigated further, I would have selected a different configuration.",0
3,It needs a manual,0
3,"The switch works fine, but it has a very high pitch whine / noise at about 9500 hertz that occurs especially loudly when under load.  I've had to find another place to put it that wasn't close to where I was working, because it was giving me a headache.  Others have confirmed the problem on some units in the Amazon review section as well.",0
3,"It will cause noise while data is traveling. Especially, more data more noise.",0
3,"So far, it's exactly as advertised.",0
3,Gave this away.  I thought it was something else.,0
3,Functions decently. Windows based GUI (Java) is the only way to manage the switch.  802.1q setup seems purposely over-complicated. Had to submit port settings multiple times until I see the traffic work properly on PVID interfacs.,0
3,Gut,0
3,普通,0
3,It is not a router.,0
3,What can I say. Plugged it in and it worked. Haven't tried the port monitor yet.,0
3,"​Hard to connect, in the end, did not used it.",0
3,Did what it was required for however I need to buy a larger unit so will be using the same seller again for an 8way unit,0
3,Version 1,0
3,This has 4 USB slots but you will probably pnly be able to use 2 or 3 at a time. The slots are too close to plug to flash drives next to each other. You can only use all four slots if you are using only the new tiny flash drives.,0
3,Works for everything else.,0
3,I bought this to eliminate the need for multiple cubes. It DOES NOT WORK with iphones.,0
3,It did not work in my car,0
3,"I used the product to charge headphones, AA battery and Apple Watch. I guess it knew that I didn’t need the fourth port because it was not working when I got it.",0
3,It dose what it was made for,0
3,I had to return it. It didn't work.,0
3,Works intermittently.,0
3,My mouse and keypad don't work when I first turn on my computer. I have to re-plug the extension in before they will come back on.,0
3,The LED lights are slightly too bright making it annoying,0
3,Very cheaply made but works.,0
3,Takes my devices FOREVERRR to charge when plugged into this splitter,0
3,My Son requested this.,0
3,Laptop wouldn’t recognize my microphone when connected through this,0
3,It’s a decent product not the best in the world but worth the money,0
3,Need more USB get more USB,0
3,"Needs updates, longer cord",0
3,It doesn’t feel sturdy,0
3,Won't work with our stuff,0
3,Did not work,0
3,Not a very long cord,0
3,We used it in the car for a road trip. We plugged it in in the back seat port and could not reach it from the front seat. When I used the front seat port it would not recognize the apps on my phone. All 4 ports would not charge at the same time.,0
3,"Beware, the ad doesn't say but this unit is directional.  It's 1 in 4 out ONLY.  It is not simply a bus. You cannot split 1 device to 2 or more computers.",0
3,We’re not charging my phone or any other equipment except my flashlight,0
3,I should have read more into the description/functionality of product didn't put out enough power to do what I needed it to do.,0
3,"looks nice,like quality material but I bought this after reading the reviews and thought it would work with my computer but it does not.I will be returning.",0
3,"3 out of 4 of the ports work, but the 4th one won't turn on.",0
3,Not reliable. One port works all the time the others work intermittently,0
3,works as advertized,0
3,Doesn’t work with iPhones,0
3,DOES NOT CHARGE. This won't charge your things. Its JUST a hub. So i can't say anything about. Except the cord is short.,0
3,"This is slow charger and doesn’t work on certain items, wish that would have been more clear in description. In addition, the buttons are easy to hit so you accidentally turn it off. Now I have to buy new product that actually charges so this was a waste",0
3,"It did not work with my apple products, I ordered 2 of them and tried many different cables to charge my Apple Watch and Phone but it did work for my non apple products.",0
3,Should have purchased 3.0 version,0
3,It's what you would expect from a cheap hub.,0
3,"I’ve used this for a long time now, this is a good concept but from time to time it stops being recognized by my computer causing me to restart maybe 1-2x per month.",0
3,Loose/inconsistent connections with the female ports.,0
3,bought  2 one fell apart,0
3,"I purchased a new comput that had just one 2UBS PORT.  I have a mouse plugged in and that's about all this decice will charge.. Cannot plug printer into it, cannot plug iPhone into it and other things. I sure didn't get my monies worth.I would NOT recommend to buy.",0
3,To small a picture,0
3,This system quits recording even while motion is detected,0
3,"I got this camera to see which one of my cats was peeing on my bed. The motion detection has caught my cat leaving the room but never them coming in- even thought the camera was pointed to cover the whole entrance. It did not catch any motion of the cat peeing on my bed, even though it was 100% included in the selected film range. Overall a decent camera. It’s always caught me and my family walking around, but if your intention is for pets I would chose a different camera.",0
3,Don't always work,0
3,Our internet is 5G only and this camera only works with a 2.4G.  I couldn't set it up because of our internet.  I am returning the camera.,0
3,Only works for motion and can only record 10 seconds,0
3,The camera is a little substandard versus The outdoor but the thing that gets me is the subscription rates when you add a second camera,0
3,Makes too much noise  purpose of cameras is to be unnoticeable,0
3,I just contacted Customer Service by chat. The sound does not work in the camera. I can hear sound on my phone but nothing comes out of the camera when I talk to it.,0
3,Cord not long enough.,0
3,The pictures upside down,0
3,Doesn’t hold connection,0
3,Camera kept disconnecting from module,0
3,Makes a static noise,0
3,Good quality when it works. Frequently stops recording at night and has to be woken by clicking live view. Customer service didn’t resolve issue.,0
3,Makes a loud clicking noise when in live mode,0
3,Doesn't work thru the windowAnd there is now a monthly fee,0
3,Goes off line frequently,0
3,"It does work and record, but if you need real-time notifications I'd look to something else. It does the recordings, but even after re-installing the app and reconnecting the camera several times I don't get the notifications.",0
3,It keep repeating the same video over an hour and make to much click noice.,0
3,As of now still unable to connect camera set up. Contacting Blink this week,0
3,It's OK. Doesn't always pick up motion.,0
3,These are not recording/alert if you don’t access the app !!,0
3,Does not wake up to catch early morning motion in the house,0
3,"Camera is good quality picture and easy set up. But the live view is extremely delayed. Also, you can’t watch live video for more than maybe 30 seconds without having to click out and back in.",0
3,If you use it in a room that is pitch black and someone turns on the lights it doesnt detect the motion. Total junk.,0
3,For the price it's a pretty decent product. Good picture quality sound is not so great. The major downfall of this product is the battery life. I used it for motorcycle commute. I was able to make it to work but on the commute home battery dies. They give you two batteries but you barely get one hour if that each battery charge. Sorry but I will be returning this product. If that's not a concern for you it's a decent product for the price. And cannot view recorded videos via app on my iPhone.,0
3,I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life.,0
3,"Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out.",0
3,It will get you started but video quality and stability is ok.,0
3,This does not include a needed micro card.,0
3,Unfortunately wasn’t worth the buy.. my dad said the quality was good.. but never connected  to any device,0
3,Looks good.Need to try it.,0
3,The camera quality isn’t what I expected. Looks a little grainy. I have not yet tried it under water,0
3,"Bought for my grandson for Easter. Worked at first then would not let him power on. Very disappointing..called and they are sending a replacement , however it is taking a long time to get. So when we do get it im keeping my fingers crossed it works this time!",0
3,normally,0
3,"Very light, feels cheaply made",0
3,"I took the camera out for the first time yesterday and the latch on the waterproof case broke.  Upon inspection, it looks like the design is very flimsy.  You also need to buy an SD card reader if you want to be able to transfer images off the camera - it estimates that it will take 60-minutes to transfer photos from the camera to my iPhone via wifi and the camera isn't recognized by my computer when I try to connect it via USB.",0
3,"Haven't used the product yet, bought it to use on kayak. So far just learning about it by looking on internet.",0
3,Takes a decent picture. Will record about 1hr video in 1080p on battery.,0
3,Three stars,0
3,The battery only last 20 minutes,0
3,"Video is decent. Audio is terrible, even with no case on it. Battery life is sub par, but it does come with 2 batteries. Basically, if you use it for video only and don't need the audio, it will be fine. If you want audio that can heard, don't buy it. I have to turn the audio all the way to max and can still barely hear what was recorded.",0
3,"The camera did its job, but I needed more",0
3,Haven't been able to get it to work yet.,0
3,Works as it should.,0
3,"I bought two of them. One of them works, but second one did not work.",0
3,So much for this brand name.,0
3,I expected the card to last more than 2 monthsGot corrupted and wouldn't work againWont buy evo brand again,0
3,"The reason I gave this card a middle rating is it cannot be formatted to FAT32, which is what my cameras take.  The firmware was changed from the first time I ordered one, to this one. So for me, it is a brick.IF you need FAT32  this will not format to that protocol.",0
3,Too expensive,0
3,First time in my life I have bought a sd card and it die within 30days of purchasing. Honestly I've never even heard of this dying but I sure got the dud.,0
3,First one didn't work. Second one did.,0
3,Solid reviews let me to my purchase of this have not had a chance to use time will tail,0
3,"Ordered 2 64 and 32, the 32 is not read, waiting for the exchange. The test speed of the 64 is decent.",0
3,It didn’t work with my dash-cam.,0
3,I experience some files or folders lost -> please go for SanDisk brand,0
3,Works,0
3,And cannot reformat,0
3,"Arrived on time. As soon as it was installed, the phone recognized it and made it available for storage.",0
3,"After placing this micro sd in my phone, it only shows that there's 119 gb available and 4.75mb are used. I paid for 128 gb not 120/119. What's the deal?",0
3,The memory has shrunk a lot.  It doesn’t seem to run as fast as expected,0
3,119 GB not 128,0
3,only 59 gb instead of 64,0
3,⭐⭐⭐,0
3,"Average write speed is 51 MB/s, and read speed is 66 MB/s. Never came close to 100 MB/s as advertised. Going to do other testing to see if I am going to keep it.",0
3,I didn't get even 500gb with this card.,0
3,Product as described,0
3,must have for any phone BUT again does not cover entire screen,0
3,After a few weeks of being in my pocket with my keys some small cracks and scratches have begun to show. I have yet to replace it with the second protector that the pack came with. It gets the job done tho.,0
3,The wet cleaning wipes were dry as a bone,0
3,Fingerprints & smudges very apparent.  Cracked on first day when it fell less than 1 ft!,0
3,Did't like...does't cover all screen...,0
3,The product works well as far as protection but I have bought 2 packs and they have sent me a pack due to the issues I was having but all of the screen protectors bubble around the edges after a couple weeks making it hard to tap anything under it. I have to change them every couple weeks.,0
3,"Three came in the package. One came cracked, one was not sticky. Was able to use one of the three in the package.",0
3,They may as well not even include the alcohol wipes because there’s no alcohol on them,0
3,Very sturdy. Full body case for my Samsung S21 5G cell phone,0
3,They seemed of lesser quality than the one it was to replace,0
3,I’ve bought screen protectors in the past that last months without cracks but these are not at all durable and barely last a week. I went through all three in the pack in just under two weeks because of how often they crack / chip from minor occurrences,0
3,See title,0
3,It cracked with in a week,0
3,"I feel this will work to give my I phone 11 screen protection from scratches from all the junk I carry in my pockets.  The screen works, that is, it is pressure sensitive just as the original was, but there seems to be a small space (1/8-1/4"") all around the face that is not covered by the screen.",0
3,Not at all,0
3,If only I could find one of these that doesn't collect bubbles.,0
3,i’m sure other people got better batches than me or can just apply it better than i can but it has a lot of bubbles and wasn’t very easy to apply. i also only got 2 in the pack even though it’s advertised as 3,0
3,"Not a strong screen protector, drop one and it will crack. Installation and everything else was fine though. Good thing it comes with 3.",0
3,Works for screen protection but it cracks every time your phone hits the ground. I’ve used others that were more durable,0
3,Runs small,0
3,A little small but technically fits,0
3,Doesn’t cover all The screen,0
3,These are more for iPhone XR’s and not really fly the 11,0
3,Slightly too small for the screen,0
3,Brooke first time I dropped it.,0
3,not recomended,0
3,Most recent batch has hairline fractures after “normal” phone drops...  glass can splinter off if phone is dropped too.,0
3,"Ive dropped and thrown my phone, wit this screen protector my phone still didn’t crack... The screen protector itself has crack but it’s still protecting my phone from being cracked",0
3,Too small,0
3,This did not work on my phone it was a tad longer than my actual screen,0
3,"somehow would crack while i was just holding it, never dropped it but the case would crack within 3 days of having it on my phone",0
3,While trying to install this protector I didn’t get it right till I had only one left the side that’s supposed to stick dry way too fast,0
3,Hello,0
3,The glass didn’t feel quite right,0
3,Does not cover whole surface,0
3,Could have been a littlecheaper.,0
3,Everything  works with any provider,0
3,The battery is going down kinda quick when u turn it off the battery percentage goes up by it self,0
3,Home button non functional.,0
3,Item came without a charger,0
3,No way this battery is 80% of original capacity.,0
3,Battery is trashed have to carry a charger everywhere,0
3,"The battery lasted about 10 minutes on a full charge. Customer service made me purchase a new one, out of pocket, and return the old one before they would send a refund. The refund took several months.",0
3,The charger that came with the phone did not work at all. And the phone shuts down randomly.,0
3,The charger port wouldn’t hold my charger in place,0
3,Had it for one year and it overheated. The battery life was only 86% when I got it.,0
3,Shipped last minute from my predicted date paid for expedited shipping. Phone gets hot after extended use ( anything over two hours) touch stops working at random times but locking and unlocking clears that issue. Speakers are LOUD to that’s a pro.,0
3,i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it,0
3,Cord does not work!,0
3,"The screen is tinier than my droid. It does not recognize my fingerprint a lot. The picture showed that little pen when I bought it, but it was not in the package, nor did it arrive later. I have to recharge the battery often.",0
3,Being a used phone watch out for battery life the batteries are not changed out on used phones so they won’t have the normal battery life.,0
3,One of the speaker on the phone do not work,0
3,Na,0
3,Battery drains from 100 to zero in 5 hours,0
3,Battery life is insufficient and less than expected.,0
3,This phone did not hold charge and is now not even turning on no matter how long you put it to charge. It shuts off. Only had it since April of 2020. I purchased another two one for my son and one for my daughter and hers is the one that won’t hold charge or do anything.,0
3,There was a screen protector  when removed it there was scratches on screen which makes me soo dissapointed😶,0
3,Clarification on unlocking to all services,0
3,"the volume on the ringer barely works and i cant use imessages, it will not connect",0
3,not working smoothly,0
3,"Battery needed replaced immediately, Audio Chip in phone burned out in 6 months and now need to replace the phone.",0
3,Brought the phone and use it maybe 2 cases and couldnt use it,0
3,The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major.,0
3,me,0
3,Could only hear on speaker phone.,0
3,"Phone has glitches. Appears up to date but things don't run properly. I purchased more storage for the phone but it still says I don't have enough storage. Screen freezes, turning the phone on and off only works temporarily if at all, among other things I am noticing more and more day by day and it's only been a week.",0
3,battery issues,0
3,Maximum capacity on battery is 81%,0
3,battery runs too... fast. Last less than a day.,0
3,A lot smaller than I thought or wanted,0
3,Battery life was at 72%,0
3,"Battery doesn’t hold power , phone dies a million times a day",0
3,Camera couldn’t focus it was continually trying,0
3,Excelente,0
3,The phone was very 4.7 in size and the battery life was 78 percent and for a iPhone this size should be at least 80 percent.,0
3,Phone arrived without a sim tray making it unusable until I could purchase a replacement tray.,0
3,Came with a screen protector.,0
3,Phone  Charger didn't work,0
3,The battery does not last,0
3,"this product didnt make one year and tore up, now i have to take it to the apple store to have it fixed, dissadisfied  with this product,",0
3,Screen came cracked smfh....,0
3,Battery doesn’t last long.,0
3,Bought this iPhone to use on tracfone it works but can’t use the WiFi calling feature.,0
3,This phone was sold to me with a battery that doesn’t charge all the way.  Servicing will cost substantially more money.,0
3,"The screen does have a long and visible scratch. It should be replaced before resale.The qualification ""renewed"" would not correct.",0
3,Not compatible with Verizon sim card,0
3,See above,0
3,A little heavy,0
3,a little smaller than i thought it would be taking pic.,0
3,"I can't turn off the alarm without turning off the phone. Three of us tried and you cannot cancel or snooze the alarm. In fact, you can't even turn down the volume. These are some interesting features for a phone.Amazon recommends that I return the item or I guess I could carry around an alarm clock and not use the alarm feature.",0
3,It's a so so phone. It works. A little laggy. I'd get the one plus nord instead.,0
3,Long run is not compatible,0
3,Late is slow,0
3,Doesn't last three days,0
3,"The screen size was adaquate. Pictures were decent. Font was too small for my liking, even at it's largest. The system froze up several times after having it only a few weeks. Sound quality wasn't impressive. I returned it. Motorola just isn't what it used to be back in the day.",0
3,... but otherwise a decent phone,0
3,even though it is unlocked phone but it wont let you turn on hot spot,0
3,I do not like this phone. It's preference leaves a lot to be desired. Battery life is incredible.,0
3,A bit complicated,0
3,"Not impressed for the money.  Felt very cheap.  Super lite watch, not impressed with the construction.",0
3,Battery doesn't last as long as advertised and gps location for time can be quirky where it changes by one hour periodically and I have to reset. This has happened 4 or 5 times this month. Without those issues it would be a 5.,0
3,One of the buttons gets stucks every once in a while causing it to skip music tracks twice or more in a row.,0
3,Battery runs out too fast,0
3,"Running, swimming",0
3,"Would rate the tracker at a 5, if the text feature was more reliable. It works intermittently.",0
3,"The watch lost connection with my phone and I was not able to pair it again until my phone operating system updated. Quite possibly an issue with the phone, but still annoying. Otherwise good watch- seems well made and sturdy. Be aware that this is not a touch screen watch and can be a bit confusing to use the sequence of buttons.",0
3,"Have had for over two months now. Battery life isn’t as advertised, maybe 4 days and tracked miles while mountain biking is always less that what Strava indicates.",0
3,It works that all I can say.,0
3,bought this because my grandkids were misrouted by the school on an overflow bus with out them letting their parents know.  Wanted to know where they were at all times.  Then found once it was received that they couldn't afford the monthly subscription necessary to make it work.,0
3,Subscription is expensive,0
3,It would take long to refresh,0
3,The accuracy isn't quite right but it will tell you where they are just gotta get used of it it jumps around a lot,0
3,As expected,0
3,Will not pick up signal most of the time.,0
3,On several occasions device didn't show current location... when I needed it to. Other than that 5*,0
3,Small and works,0
3,Can't set it up.,0
3,location not accurate,0
3,"Device will not auto update. Customer ""support"" tells you to do the same thing over and over with no result. Email support is even worse the person saying they tried to call you (no) and they need more information and to call back then you get the same runaround.",0
3,Tracking is off after second day of using,0
3,Battery dies to quick. And notifications work when they want to (but I will see them whenever I login to the app),0
3,Not very accurate device.,0
3,It technically worked. But I wouldn’t say “in real time.” Customer service did refund me for my 30-day subscription though. So there’s that.,0
3,Was not as accurate as I needed,0
3,The app had glitches !,0
3,Battery life was very short,0
3,Does not hold charge for very long.,0
3,"I was expecting the device to be tracked from my phone on an app, but not a monthly subscription fee that does not have an On/Off option. So even when not needed, it is still a fee.",0
3,Accuracy is not consistent,0
3,I live in a remote area in Alaska gps is slightly of and slow to respond. Battery life dosent last but a half day-one day and it need to be recharged nightly.,0
3,liam from billing was awsome per my requests !,0
3,Soso,0
3,vey slow update. Takes too long to find target and does not show live movement.,0
3,A bit complicated and does not always pop up on phone?,0
3,I just have for one day so can’t tell,0
3,The bathery doesnt even last 48 hrs after 10 hrs plugged to the outlet.,0
3,Seems to work,0
3,This was way to bulky for a key chain or my small dog’s collar,0
3,Location updates to slow. Shows not in range when standing in front of me. Location on map not same place tile is.,0
3,So far this works well but you have to pay over $30 for the app.,0
3,Long delays in receiving response and only available via email.  Very time consuming.,0
3,It’s small,0
3,"Gave one to my wife, and the other to my daughter.They really wanted to try them since they both are always searching for their keys (or phone).Took a while to get them working with their phones.  They had some issues with connectivity, and something else that I cannot remember.Eventually, they both have given up and do not now use them.  Apparently, it was too much trouble.I cannot say much from personal experience, because I was not involved in setting them up.",0
3,"My iPhone 7 can never find these. We put one on our cat who barely goes outside (the other roam the neighborhood.) He took it off some where in the house, and the app says it’s up the street and we can’t find it.",0
3,Nine months later it shows its location but the audio ring is only a momentary beep. Can’t find the tile without searching everything.  It just that it’s near.,0
3,"It works sometimes, but once a while it does't work. They did not mentioned it needs subscription.",0
3,The distance is not as advertised. It should be 400 feet but it can barely make it from one side to the other of my small apartment. Also it can never find my phone even when all the correct settings are on. It will be right next to my phone and will say it cannot detect it. Isn't serving me much use at the moment.,0
3,"The Tile Pro is much larger than necessary for any use I can imagine.  For those of us who carry keys in our pockets, the Tile is way too bulky especially if you also have a car fob on the same key ring .  The company needs to make them much smaller and thinner.  Separately, it goes without saying, the auto industry needs to build locators into their key fobs so we don't need to add Tiles to the key ring.",0
3,Daughter uses it all the time.,0
3,probably a google spy following your every move,0
3,I bought these to wear while I ride my quad. They aren’t very loud at all,0
3,When on the phone the other person can not hear you.  Too much noise,0
3,Just a little too big but they did have different cushion sizes and when you touch then they are very sensitive,0
3,They're big.,0
3,Not loud enoughHard to answer calls3rd pair of these series of head Tozos.,0
3,The charger case has to be recharged constantly. I only use them for maybe thirty minutes at a time and after about the second or third time of use I have to recharge the case. Seems excessive compared to other earbuds I've had in the past.,0
3,Doesnt work in water,0
3,They are not really that loud. Decent bass though.,0
3,Could be louder,0
3,"Mehhh. I researched these because I didn’t want to spend a crazy amount of money on ear buds. That was a mistake, just spend the money on good ones, you get what you pay for with these. I bought them mainly to mow lawn with, and I can barely hear the music over the mower. They’re absolute junk. Don’t waste your money.",0
3,Couldn’t get them to stay in my ears even doing simple tasks so returned.,0
3,You’ll know what I mean,0
3,They showed up late and without a charger 🤷🏼‍♀️,0
3,For some reason it repeatedly disconnects during calls.  Not when listening to music but consistently during phone calls.  (My main need for the ear pieces). I’ve tried unpairing and reconnecting several times but continues to be an issue.,0
3,The sound quality is good but they keep falling out of my ears,0
3,"These are very well made. The sound quality is incredible and it does block outside noise in the sense you can hear the person, however, the person on the other end of the phone can hear everything around you. Sometimes the things around you are even louder than you. If that issue could be fixed I would give these 5 stars. I like the adaptable earbud sizes, they ear buds fit well and don’t make your ears uncomfortable for quite some time. Over all very good but the noise issue made them almost useless.",0
3,Everyone say that they can hear everything else but me sometimes,0
3,Volume could be higher.,0
3,They looked brand new but I couldn't get the bud's to turn on so I returned for a refund.,0
3,"When I touch my ears because they itching, the tooth shuts off. I cannot simply tap the Bluetooth device to reconnect. If I have the phone charging,  I have to get up and hit the Bluetooth icon on the phone to continue my conversation",0
3,"Prefer a generic Bluetooth,  without needing an app.",0
3,"Won't stay in ears, no matter size of ear rubber. Too heavy, so fall right out even just sitting at the computer..forget exercising with them. Why do cheap ones have battery life 3 x longer?",0
3,I love them. But I can only use one. My left earbud suddenly won't play sound besides incredibly quiet. Resetting does nothing. Don't know how to contact the seller to find out what to do. They are good otherwise but only using the right earbud all the time is making my ear very uncomfortable.,0
3,Right earbud doesn't work properly. I guess that's what I get for buying used.,0
3,Music,0
3,"These earbuds are great at first. I started with the original Galaxy Buds, then one side died completely and never worked again. I attributed that to the silicon lottery, so I upgraded to the Buds+. Then, it happens again after about a year having this pair. I'm a Samsung fan, but I can't endorse the lifespan and overall quality of this product.",0
3,"Audio has a ""tinnie"" quality.",0
3,"If you move your jaw, these will loosen and fall out. If you sweat too much while wearing them, they will automatically skip songs, etc.Samsung really needs to introduce an anti-loss strap for these.",0
3,"Decent pair, don't work with other brand besides Samsung",0
3,"After only having the earbuds for about a month, the right earbud started disconnecting and now it doesnt work Doesnt register, doesn't charge , just doesn't work at all.",0
3,Left earbud quit working after 6 months.,0
3,These weren't supposed to be refurbished but they are not the quality of the ones I had prior which were exact same.,0
3,The earbuds are too touch sensitive. I keep pausing or fast forwarding my music every time I try to adjust the earbud in my ear. The fit is not that great either. I've gotten better sound quality (and less annoyance) from Skullcandy or ME Buyz earbuds.,0
3,Don’t stay in ear,0
3,They randomly disconnect a lot. Get Bose.,0
3,They were just ok.Very little noise canceling,0
3,I can’t hear one side of it.,0
3,Not much of a difference or upgrade between this and the first gen pair.,0
3,Didn't like these. They kept falling out of my ear. I do have small ears & tried the different gaskets they came with..nothing worked. Admittedly they didn't sound too bad.,0
3,Useful at home during day.  Awful blue flashing at night renders themUseless.,0
3,Foam earpieces came off right away. Was able to slip them over but they continuous come off,0
3,"It didn’t come with a charger, the box was very beat up",0
3,I Ordered a product that did not work for  my TV,0
3,Mic doesn't actually work,0
3,Regular quality,0
3,The sound is not loud,0
3,"The ear things fell off , dont last long",0
3,They work! The soft thing fell off though. I had to tape/glue it back on.,0
3,"Absolutely no noise cancellation, which is a disappointment because that was the main reason for buying them. I’d give it 0 stars for that category if I could. Easy to setup though. Clear sound quality, but not a lot of bass.",0
3,The charger connection part in the headphone break within three months. I have to manually hold and push the charger cable in order for it to charge. I tried contacting the company and have not yet received a reply.,0
3,These work very well and are comfortable; however the volume is way too loud. Note this is per my 16 year old son who likes his music loud. This is also with the volume on the lowest setting. It is uncomfortable enough that we are ordering a different set because they hurt his ears.,0
3,Quality,0
3,"A little bit cheap feeling, but it does the job.",0
3,Disconnects when attached to the screen but works wirelessly,0
3,They still have phantom drift and connectivity issue.,0
3,These quit working within a 3 months of buying them. It was part of a Christmas gift for my kiddos. I ended up going to target and buying the gray set that have held up. I'll need to buy replacement parts to get this set up and working again.,0
3,The batteries drain way too fast for a new joycon.,0
3,"Brand new and started drifting soon after use. I can’t believe It, do I have to send away 2 sets now?",0
3,Is the same as the ones your switch will come with. They are just as prone to drift,0
3,IIIV,0
3,The controllers are fine but the color in my opinion is not yellow. To me it looks more like neon green. I was disappointed.,0
3,"Someone had the genius idea to buy a set of these joycon for their switch, and swap the old ones they got, probably from launch day when they got the console. Grabbed their old ones and put them in the box then sent them back!",0
3,"I thought this came with a center plastic holder, it does not",0
3,"Way too expensive, but they work as expected.",0
3,Pricey!,0
3,The red controller is not working blue controller only working,0
3,"This is a very delicate procedure that can easily end in disaster & a $100 bill to replace your mistake. High quality and good instructions, the actual change out was above mine and my sons ability in the end. We succeeded on the first and failed on the second.",0
3,Ordered a pair of these joy cons and the green controller dial can’t point to the right. Didn’t notice until playing Just Dance and realized that I can move cursor to the right. Had to return them without the box and the new ones are so expensive ($160 plus fees and tax). Sad experience.,0
3,"After using these controllers for less than a month, the left controller disconnects for brief moments multiple times a gaming session.  I have hardly used them and this really hinders game play.  It's too late to exchange so it sucks for the consumer.",0
3,You don't even get then same amount of plastic as a Wii Remote. How am I supposed to sodomize anyone with this thing?,0
3,"Honestly, this has been a disappointing controller and I wanted to like it.  I have had the standard Xbox controller, the previous Elite controller and they have all had similar issues.  The bumper buttons fail and the thumb sticks either drift or do not press down any longer.  I know Microsoft has attempted to address these issues but so far no luck.  The controller feels better the the first elite, in other words, more solid and quality seems better if you ignore the repeating issues.  This controller lasted less than a year but I tried to deal with the issues thinking I had another month on the warranty.  Unfortunately I misremembered the date of purchase and missed the warranty window by days.I would recommend purchasing the less expensive, less well made and less featured version of the Xbox controller so replacement isn't as costly.  I would also purchase a extended warranty if available.  At the first sign of issue, contact Microsoft, DO NOT WAIT like I did.",0
3,Ordered new and got used for new price.,0
3,A button on my control doesn't work. What do I do?,0
3,3 stars because of the minimal drift to the left stick.,0
3,"For the $$$ that this controller costs, you would think they could at least throw a stick ""zeroing"" or calibration feature to the software. After only 3 months left stick drifted up and down directions. Had to go through the hassle of sending to Microsoft for warranty replacement.",0
3,Unit opened and used . Didn’t notice or use until after return time passed...,0
3,"In the description it said nothing was broken, but the right stick had a lot of stick drift that it affected other buttons",0
3,Got my controller it's working fine no button sticking or thumbstick drift. It did come with a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate trial code that has been redeemed already which shouldn't be happening since it was SUPPOSED to be bought brand new. Something petty to review on still I paid $180 for this so I expect everything to be as new of course I shouldn't have expected much from whom ever who sold this.,0
3,Controller will randomly turn off even on a full charge. also having issues with controller drift that is starting to become more apparent,0
3,"For the money it costs, to purchase these type items, you would expect that they would work beyond 90 days.  I purchased mine in Dec of 2019 and received it in Jan.  No problem with anything, at first.  The charging cradle is great.  The reception gets a little flaky at times and says that it is no longer connected to the Xbox, when the light shows that it is clearly, on.  Of course, disconnections happen at the most inopportune times and last for about 10 to 15 seconds.  8 months in.............. the right bumper started to fail.  Of course, the standard warranty is for only 90 days.  It is unbelievable that, for the price, that the controllers are the weakest link in game play.  My first controller lasted 2 years.  I guess I was lucky.  Now, I am forced to buy another controller.  SMH........",0
3,Bought it in February and already have stick drift,0
3,"Controller came very quickly but only had a single replacement paddle for the paddles on the back. Not one set of each, just one short paddle",0
3,Left thumb stick started to drift about 5 months after purchasing,0
3,Item did not come with the USB C cable.,0
3,"I believed that I had ordered a new item, only to receive an item that had already been opened.  Seals had been removed and there were knife marks on the packaging.  Item was returned.",0
3,Dislike.-immediate driftLikes-weight-everything else,0
3,Has a 2 part plugin. USB is for the lights. And headphone jack for sound. More for laptop than using with controllers.,0
3,I can't use it in my laptop.,0
3,"I’m very picky, and the headset did not meet all my expectations. I wish it was wireless, the wires are too damn long, and also I wanted the volume to be a little louder.",0
3,Functional headphones but it looks really cheap.,0
3,"It's comfy, has decent volume and controls, but doesn't last a full year.",0
3,As the title says,0
3,Might just me my pc or Xbox but the mic was very quiet for everyone on the discord call and Xbox party,0
3,The microphones too quiet,0
3,Mic doesn’t work for my sons PS4,0
3,these are ok when i bought these i thought it would be perfect to tune out outer noise it doesnt its good to hear for music & if you play it others that are in your surroundings can hear just as much as you can.... phone calls can be heard thru these headphones... might send back but really dont like,0
3,They work,0
3,Had to buy the Adapter separately,0
3,The only time u cant hear anything is when u have it on full volume,0
3,They aren’t noise cancellation and have a very loose fit on my ears. Also the sound quality is pretty bad and delayedThey’re decent starter headphones though.,0
3,Everything’s good except the fact the mic doesn’t pick up anything so no one can hear you and the voice cancellation is 0%,0
3,My son uses these. This is the second time i bought it and he keeps saying the audio makes noises.,0
3,Eh,0
3,gets the job done,0
3,The headset was very good and sounded great but the wire broke two months after using them and now they aren’t able to be used.,0
3,Had to return because they quit working.  Got a new one immediately.  It quit working a few days later too.,0
3,Static sound while using.,0
3,Started having issues with miceophone shortly after purchase. Will not buy again.,0
3,External leds do not light up on my headset.,0
3,its not really good its ok,0
3,Thin. Wierd gray color,0
3,Not really soft at all. I have bought other towels which are much softer.,0
3,wasn`t as thick or soft as expected.,0
3,It gives off lots of lint after washing,0
3,Far too many misc threads and pulls were visible.,0
3,I used it after a shower and it leaves lint on my body. It's also starting to cover my bathroom in lint in places i rarely touch,0
3,Threads get caught and pulls the threads in the towels,0
3,These towels are not very absorbent and are uneven.,0
3,This is why you don’t order online,0
3,The only issue I have is the color of the towels. They are about 2 shades lighter than I expected.,0
3,Discoloration after first wash,0
3,"These towels are thick and soft, but the color faded to almost white in some spots after the first wash.",0
3,The color was not the same as pictured,0
3,It's on the thinner side,0
3,Just average.,0
3,Not as thick and as absorbent as I expected.,0
3,Kinda rough,0
3,These towels really aren't GOLDthey're between a brown  and a beige..they really aren't the color gold I was looking for but their just guest towels..disappointing,0
3,Extreme lint on first wash. Do not wash with anything else. Medium thickness and softness. Absorbency slightly above average. A sufficient set for the price.,0
3,"I received 2 towels , not the completed set .",0
3,Gave slot of little fabric balls when washed.,0
3,Color. In the Bathroom. Some of the edging on the wash cloths started to fall apart after the 1st washing. Cheaply made.,0
3,"If you looking for a gold color no this is more like a tan call color , and the towels was not fluffy at all hard material.",0
3,"Washed three times, there is a hole in one of the towels!!!",0
3,My package only included 2 washcloths instead of 4.Good quality though,0
3,Too much lint,0
3,What is to be expected. nothing special. not a great but ok deal.,0
3,"Decent product, they are absorbent but on the cheaper made side",0
3,Thin,0
3,They are not durable at all. My towels are already unraveling on the side stitching after 3 washes. Cheap towels and cheap quality,0
3,towels did not have darker color trim as seen in the picture. also not as thick as video.,0
3,so,0
3,not soft at all,0
3,"I purchased these thinking they would match the beige in our guest bath. I did not wash them, I just hung them up out of the packaging for decoration only. They are not beige, they are a pale mustard yellow color. I do not know if they are absorbent or soft as they will not be used. The dye batches must have been separate as some are lighter and some are a shade darker.",0
3,Did not a year with my son .,0
3,Not soft or full,0
3,not as thick as i would have thought,0
3,Towels aren’t that thick guess the price is right,0
3,The smell before you wash it,0
3,I did not get one of my large towels.in the set.,0
3,"This towel could be softer, It feels little rough.",0
3,"The photo shows a deep purple color, which is what I wanted. However, the towels I received are 2 to 3 shades lighter. I am returning them. The towels are not as thick as I thought they were.",0
3,Washes poorly with shinkage,0
3,Does not stay in place. The toilet one does but not the rectangular one for the sink.,0
3,It was used for bathroom.,0
3,Too small,0
3,"Rugs beginning to pill. Soft, but they tend to slide around on tile floor.Will not buy again.",0
3,Really little,0
3,The color is deep and looks lux but the rug doesn’t grip onto the tile.,0
3,After 3 washes the backing comes off.,0
3,Does not stick to tile floors,0
3,"This rug is soft and the colors have never faded, even after washing. The problem is that it absorbs so well that it doesn’t dry out all the way and now smells musty, even after washing. I have this rug right outside the shower. I won’t purchase this again.",0
3,"They are soft and absorbent, but they slide. I adjust them 7,000 times a day. If you’re looking for a non slip rug, this is NOT it.",0
3,Some of the shag parts are coming outNot as thick as my last ones I boughtI’m think my first set came from a different company,0
3,Rug shed a lot,0
3,Replacement and match addition on other of the same brand. The only brand allowed in my bathrooms going forward.,0
3,Seeabove.,0
3,Color was not exactly what I wanted.,0
3,Doesn’t absorb water at all. Puddle underneath the mat,0
3,Was not the quality that I expected. For a room without a lot of traffic it would be ok.,0
3,Not enough rubber backing . Still slides,0
3,Not as much rubber backing as expected. They do slide on floor,0
3,The rug was very sift but not plush at all.  It was very thin.  I’m returning it.,0
3,Not as dense as pictures and color different from pictures.,0
3,"It flattens when stepped on. Gorilla grip does not keep rug in place.  It was the correct size and color, but ""luxurious"" is a stretch when describing the softness.",0
3,"Standard loop style bath mat.  It is soft and absorbent, however it does NOT stay put.  It moves around and I am constantly straightening it.  The gorilla grip backing is not as good as I thought.  It’s just ok",0
3,Rug is a different color than the picture and the edges are freyed.,0
3,Returned product,0
3,Bought this for the fact it advertised softness/cushion which is a complete fabrication on the 17 x 24 size.,0
3,"Color was not as in photo. Rug was thin, lacking quality.",0
3,"I expected the rug to be thicker, softer, more plush.  I have not washed it yet.  I do not find it stays in place",0
3,It wasn’t as dense as I had expected and you could see between the yarn. I will probably use it for a bath mat and get a different rug.,0
3,"Not as plush as it seems, very  thin",0
3,Not what I expected,0
3,Overpriced for the quality.,0
3,Needs suction cups on bottom to hold in place. Mine moves,0
3,"I think it catches some hair, but the design reduces drainage. So now the shower floor is dirty with soap scum instead of hair. Product needs improvement.",0
3,Not reliable,0
3,I found that these hair catchers kept slipping out of the way and letting the hair into the drain but they were cheap and they may work for other shower configs for all I know.,0
3,Moves around a little too much so it doesn't catch all the hair,0
3,They catch hair ! But annoying to clean !,0
3,"According to the photo, I thought that they would be convex, but as it turned out, they are flat and not convenient to use. They can only be used for the kitchen sink.",0
3,They work well but it’s hard to get my long hair untangled from it,0
3,Stops hair from going down the drain but it gets tangled in the spikes and makes it a bit difficult to clean,0
3,"It wasn’t what I expected, it moves with the water, doesn’t have a suction system in the bottom .",0
3,"Would not buy again, not something practical",0
3,Do not stay in drain,0
3,These slip out of place,0
3,Slows down water drainage,0
3,These have no suction power they are always moving. I do like the color but the gabs are so big that it doesn't really retain any hair.,0
3,Does not catch hair.,0
3,"At first, I thought they seemed great. Comfy. They’re a great size. However, after just a week, they’re become pretty uncomfortable. I’m not sure what it is. They seem a little too firm for my liking. Hurts my back and neck. ): I really wanted to like these pillows, but it’s a little disappointing.",0
3,Seem to be just so so for the price.,0
3,Extremely firm,0
3,Decent quality but lacking in that “hotel fluffiness”,0
3,Too thin for comfort/sleep,0
3,The pills were good for a week and then they lost there shape and fullness. Not worth all the money we spent on buying 4 of them.,0
3,These pillows are fluffy and great to sleep on but not cool at all.,0
3,Not as firm as expected,0
3,not a cooling pillow,0
3,It is too soft!,0
3,The pillows don’t seem to be very cooling.,0
3,Pillow gets hot. Losing support after a few months,0
3,It was supposed to be a set of two pillows but was sent only one pillow 😒,0
3,Not enough filling.,0
3,"When you lay your head on it, it goes nearly flat.",0
3,Appeared soft and fluffy. However it was not very soft and was very lumpy. After three months we ditched them.,0
3,Pillows were not soft and were too hot for me.,0
3,One of the pillows came very flat and will not fluff up even after a week. Don’t think I would buy them again.,0
3,Pillow isOut .of shape already,0
3,"The support is terrible, they came rolled up so I let them sit out as directed for 24hrs and fluffed vigorously as directed... they only expanded a little bit and are still just as flat as my old pillows. King size pillow with very little stuffing inside.",0
3,not wat I expected,0
3,If I put 2 in one case it sort of works... way too soft for me.,0
3,It's a very ok pillow. Nothing special. Gets flat easily and doesn't pop back up. Waking up with neck hurting. Don't see what the hype is all about.,0
3,"Pillow is somewhat firm, which as side sleepers we were looking for, but I don't find it ""cooling"" whatsoever, and neither did my husband.",0
3,Not what I thought,0
3,Paid $50 and only received one pillow,0
3,Very thingDoes not deserve the price,0
3,Not thick enough. More stuffing needed.,0
3,It's Ok. It's a pillow.,0
3,There are the exact size of the standard pillows I am replacing.  I would rate them higher if they were larger.,0
3,"I can’t sleep on it. My husband uses it as his pillow that he holds while he sleeps, but he can’t sleep on it either.",0
3,They’re just ok.,0
3,Not exactly what I’m looking for. Very soft,0
3,Thought these pillows were cooling but they are not.  They do keep there shape and are extremely soft.,0
3,Not firm enough,0
3,Pillows is soft and has the cooling but falls short in expectation as it is very flat snd both have to be used.,0
3,Thinner than they appear in the picture,0
3,These pillows were supposed to be firm and they are not.,0
3,"The cover is okay, but the material is not as thick as some mattress covers.  Also, the cover ends at the top edges of the mattress.  The material that runs along the sides of the mattress is a thin elastic material to hold the cover in place, but it offers no protection from spills.",0
3,Makes the mattress feel much firmer than without it. Has a rough feel to it and is a hassle to dry after washing because it holds moisture.,0
3,Washed it a handful of times but still urine seeps they to new mattress.,0
3,"Product listing claims that this mattress protector is waterproof, but our puppy peed on bed & the urine penetrated the mattress protector & stained the mattress cover. So NOT 100% waterproof.",0
3,"This was one of the top items for King mattress pad search.  It arrived and it is a mattress protector.  My fault for not seeing that detail before purchase, but just want to make others aware.",0
3,Very thin yet to see if it is stain proof,0
3,Ripped after a week of using it,0
3,"It doesn’t stay on the bed, doesn’t offer full protection.",0
3,"Protective, but could be softer.",0
3,It made our mattress 10x hotter and we always wake up sweating even in the winter.,0
3,Not know.,0
3,Just ok. Nothing to write home about.,0
3,It will not tighten up to where all of the wrinkles come out of it.,0
3,It is little bit thin.,0
3,It makes me feel hot,0
3,Not the best product out there but for guest room is just fine.,0
3,It isn’t tight enough so it keeps slipping around the mattress.,0
3,lets 30% water thru the fabric,0
3,"Thinner than I expected, have not washed it yet, so maybe update this review",0
3,Is NOT WATER RESISTANT! My son used the bathroom and it went right through. Would return but it’s all pissy,0
3,Water was still able to go through.,0
3,It’s not what I thought it would be. It doesn’t zip up at the bottom and it’s not stain resistant.,0
3,not very waterproof.,0
3,Not what I was expecting. It is much thinner than the other two I have purchased.,0
3,This product is okey for it’s price.,0
3,It’s quiet,0
3,Works.,0
3,Did not use for potty training,0
3,Caused too much sweating.,0
3,"Wasn’t a fan. The sheet being flannel is too warm, the plastic underside made it slippery on the mattress",0
3,"It doesn’t “breathe,it caused me to have night sweats.",0
3,Protection of expensive mattress,0
3,Very thin but the size fits my king size mattress,0
3,Just realized that this was the reason I've been sleeping hot on my memory foam mattress.Memory foam sleeps hot in general and this makes my back burn when i sleep.,0
3,Move to much from the mattress,0
3,"Bought the king sized version of this for a memory foam mattress.  I was told that memory foam beds are much warmer/hotter than traditional mattresses.... they were right.  I was told that this protector adds to the ""hot"" experience...  it did.  I am now looking for a permeable protector...  one that breathes.",0
3,To early to make a comment,0
3,It slips off my mattress,0
3,It’s fits my twin xl.,0
3,Seems ok.,0
3,Na,0
3,To make these pillows plump I had to add quite a lot of addl filler.,0
3,Title,0
3,"These pillows are so thin! Even after running them in the dryer with a tennis ball, they barely fill out the pillowcase.",0
3,Not enough filling in the pillows. Too flat and cannot hold shape.,0
3,"Stock pictures showed its more plush and fully, but the real deal is very flat. I opened the bag so I have to keep it but will buy the different one soon.",0
3,"These are very thin and flimsy, don’t even fill up pillow shams",0
3,I purchased these to use with decorative shams but they need to be a little more firm and not lumpy.,0
3,Too thin. Soft though.,0
3,This pillow is flat.,0
3,I anticipated a much more lofty pillow. These are soft….very soft.,0
3,They are right size for throw pillows an the covers u got separately.,0
3,Not fluffy.,0
3,"Not very full. Said that they would fluff up throughout the first week,  they didn't.",0
3,I thought it would be firmer,0
3,Didn’t fluff up much. Shipping box was big enough that it really wasn’t necessary to vacuum seal the pillows.,0
3,Made my pillows look extremely flat,0
3,Really smaller than I thought. Should have measured.,0
3,They don't stay fluffy the go flat after a few days of using them,0
3,"These inserts are actually kind of flat and not very firm. I ended up having to buy four and placed two in each pillow case before I had decent throw pillows. But they are priced cheap, so about what you can expect.",0
3,Not as large as advertised and not very full.,0
3,Doesn't puff out the cushion cover enough. For the price i thought they would be premium and they are not,0
3,Not blump enoughLike the softness,0
3,They are much thinner than expectedIt took two of these pillows to partially fill my cases.,0
3,Pillows are not full. Very thin and flimsy and never fluffed up.,0
3,Kinda cheap parts,0
3,This went crooked a couple months in and has had a little lean to the back right.  I have to spray lube into it every few months to get rid of the loud creaking that occurs whenever I shift weight.  I've just tolerated it for years but now that I'm working from home and in the thing all day I will be replacing it.  It has served its purpose.,0
3,Much much smaller than anticipated. But it’s a decent chair for the price.,0
3,It's cheap so don't expect too much.Pretty stiff. Cheaply made.,0
3,"Use this product at my home desk .Just not enough  in the seat,  you tend to sit in  a hole going downeard.",0
3,Fact that chair does not stay in locked in chosen heighth position!,0
3,Thin material with little padding. I couldnt imagine more than 1 hour in this chair.  Cheap.,0
3,Started to fall apart less than a year after purchase -at that time it has been used the equivalent of 8 month of 2/3 hours per day use.  Then it completely disintegrated when COVID-19 time came and it got subjected to daily use for a couple of months.,0
3,The chair is very small and basic,0
3,It was much smaller than I expected.,0
3,When I was shopping for a chair I read a review of how after a couple weeks this chair leaned to one side. Shoulda paid attention.,0
3,Not intended for obese people,0
3,After unboxing and assembling the chair is smaller than expected and it didn’t tilt backs,0
3,LOOKS CHEAP,0
3,"Maybe it's just me, but after a month one of the armrests got a crack, and a few months later it cracked completely apart.",0
3,The chair is not very comfortable. The seat is not very well padded. I put a chair pillow on the seat and it is tolerable now. My biggest complaint is I ordered a brown chair but they sent me a BLACK one. I needed the chair so I did not return it. This is a budget chair so it would surprise me if it is still functioning in a couple years but when you don't have much money you sort of have to make due.,0
3,"The magnetic wheels dont work,i kept fallint off the chair",0
3,"If you are not broke, unlike me, spend more money and buy a better chair. This chair is uncomfortable to sit on. I regret buying it. I will force myself to use it I guess.",0
3,I should have well-noted the first Q&A.  The maximum height of the vertical-adjust makes the seat 21 inches off the ground.  That is not very high.,0
3,"Very thin padding, this won’t last long",0
3,Smaller than expected and not sturdy,0
3,Very cheaply made. Dosent hold ot of weight.,0
3,Way smaller than expected,0
3,With a little tweaking the shelves can work out. I painted the backside of them to give them a seal because I'm made out of that material that can fall apart when it is close to moisture and I'm using this in my bathroom. So far they're staying together. They bow with a lot of weight.,0
3,Much smaller than I expected in height,0
3,Looks cheap but serves it's purpose.,0
3,"The plastic poles don't thread too well and this leads to some pretty flimsy shelves.  If it's in a low traffic area with no adventure-seeking cats it will serve its purpose just fine, but if you need something sturdier keep shopping.",0
3,Wood was chipped.,0
3,Too small for the price,0
3,The shelves are particle board.  That’s not visible in the photos.  Storing anything heavy on particle board causes it to sag.  These are decent light duty shelves.,0
3,Not sturdy enough,0
3,plants,0
3,It was scuffed up a bit,0
3,Despite tightening as much as possible the structure seems flimsy.,0
3,Decent product,0
3,Very cheaply made. Cracks and chips as if it was used. I use ot to hold my sons board games so it works. I wouldn't put too much weight on it!,0
3,it wobble,0
3,It was smaller than I expect and not sturdy.,0
3,Very wobbly,0
3,"Should have guessed based on the price, but these shelves are incredibly flimsy.  All made out of cheap plastic, don’t expect it to hold much weight",0
3,Very small for the price,0
3,It was not as sturdy. But it worked for my need.,0
3,Not sturdy at all,0
3,I expected item to be bigger,0
3,Way smaller then i thought.,0
3,"Im using this in a basement storage, its very cheap, not very durable for heavier items, but it'll serve its purpose. I would not put this where others could see it. It looks cheap.",0
3,Not what I expected!  It looks cheap and doesn’t have the capacity I needed.,0
3,"cheap plastic, can't handle weight",0
3,It arrived with two chipped edges.,0
3,Was putting it together and I had a long pole snap on me while I was twisting it in.,0
3,It looks bigger on site. It will do the job for now. We needed a utility shelf and this is a little smaller than expected. More of a livingroom or office shelf,0
3,"Very flimsy, but functional....",0
3,Max weight per shelf is 15 lbs. Entire piece is made of compressed wood and plastic.,0
3,Its a little on the wobbly side. I wouldn’t buy it to place very much on the upper shelves or anything very heavy on it at all.,0
3,Wobbly,0
3,Small and a little fragile,0
3,"very wobbly. definately needs to be anchored to wall in several places. its lightweight, so dont plan on books or very many electronics,even while anchored.",0
3,It is made cheep. Didn’t expect plastic very unsteady,0
3,Check the dimension before purchasing.,0
3,Not very sturdy. Buy something else,0
3,"Not sturdy, but did it’s job for holding my makeup and perfume. I would not put anything heavy on it.",0
3,It is wobbly.,0
3,Product came cracked,0
3,when we moved it a part of the desk fell off,0
3,It will get the job done.......But don't expect this desk to hold up very long if your kid is doing home schooling.,0
3,was smaller than i thought it might be but it works!,0
3,It didn’t come with instructions,0
3,Cheap man made particle wood.,0
3,It was really sturdy after being out together,0
3,Smaller than I expected.,0
3,Not durable,0
3,Cheaply made. Desk is wobbly already and even when I tighten it it still loosens. Would not reccomend.,0
3,Much smaller than expected. This is more for a child than office furniture for an adult.,0
3,Small desk for small areas. It will serve its purpose but it isn't durable. Cheaply made.,0
3,It’s not water proof,0
3,"This very small, it is a kids size",0
3,Not quite durable.,0
3,Paint peels off.,0
3,"The pre drilled holes were drilled out a little too big, so we had to get bigger screws than the ones provided. Other than that it seems to be okay.",0
3,Very small. Not very sturdy. I don’t think it’ll hold up when we move.,0
3,Had to return it. The desk has a weight limit and my Mac and printer exceeded the limit,0
3,I used I for school,0
3,"I returned this the next day. The desk arrived, and as soon as I opened it, it had visible scratches on every surface I could see.",0
3,"It was way smaller than i thought. Im only 5""1 and still feel stuffed when sitting.",0
3,Instructions for assembly were not sufficient.,0
3,Loud but for this price what you can expect .,0
3,Ya it functions and all but it don’t push much air at all.,0
3,See headline,0
3,This fan is great until it stopped working. We changed the fuse but it did not help.,0
3,"The older model might have been louder, but it blew a lot more air.",0
3,It does the job,0
3,"Not enough power, especially for a Honeywell product.",0
3,I gave it 3 stars because it doesn't blow very much air even on high. It is very quiet though!,0
3,I sleep with a fan year-round for the sound on high this thing barely makes a noise I don't like,0
3,"Not a lot of power even on the highest level,",0
3,Not work as expected nor needed.,0
3,Bought 2 and they both died after 1+years. Other than that they’re fantastic!,0
3,Moves air but its loud.,0
3,Look at my profile pic,0
3,Doesn't angle down. Only forward to the facing up position.  We need the down direction as many would.,0
3,Hardly hear it,0
3,I was looking for more white noise...so quite.,0
3,If it blew harder on high would of been 5 stars,0
3,Loud noise,0
3,It’s too working anymore. Only had it for a couple of months,0
3,It is smaller than I thought.Buyer beware,0
3,"It does the job of heating a room, but I need something quiet as I wanted to use this in my office and I am on video/audio calls all day. This is loud enough that my system actually reminds me I'm on mute because it thinks I'm trying to say something. I'll return it but for some folks looking for something small and efficient where the noise is irrelevant it could work.",0
3,"Makes a lot of noise.  Much louder than the Lazlo heater, but Lazlo quit working after four months.",0
3,Heats the space but is much louder than other heaters of the same size.,0
3,"Really loud, gets hot though",0
3,"Sometimes it does not turn off with thermostat, wake up to a hot room",0
3,Too loud!,0
3,Does not put out that much heat unless you are very close to it. It really does not heat up the very small room I have.,0
3,I’ve had this heater for a year and two weeks. It quit working today. The warranty was for a year.  : (,0
3,Heats well but fan wasn't very powerful if I remember right. I did return it,0
3,"It says it has a thermostat, but it's just an up or down dial that leaves you to guess where to set it for a particular temp.",0
3,Not as big as I thought,0
3,I used this product for heat but it blows cold air from the back always,0
3,Doesn’t shut off automatically,0
3,Loud and heat control isn’t much to brag about.,0
3,"Nice size, gives off decent amount of heat... but control doesn’t seems to change much. Cannot use while teaching online  because it is noisy...:(  Cannot hear my kids.",0
3,Didn’t heat the room I think the room may have been too big for this output.,0
3,Test,0
3,"Takes a while to heat up room but it does end up heating the overall room in about 30 minutes! Heat is not directly felt, blast radius is not far! Need to be really close in order to feel!",0
3,Gets hot enough but thermostat does not operate as described.  Also much louder than expected.,0
3,To small,0
3,Puts out much less heat than another heater I had with same rating.,0
3,The first heater broke so i ordered another one. It doesnt output much heat its good for a very small room.,0
3,will heat only small area.,0
3,It is very loud but heats the bathroom adequately,0
3,"Not as quiet as expected, but reasonable.",0
3,Had the return the heater after trying to get rid of the heavy chemical smell for two weeks.,0
3,"Although it works fine, it is quite noisy",0
3,Very noise!!!,0
3,Doesn’t put out much air even on the highest speed,0
3,You can have quiet or a lot of air but not both.,0
3,"Good fan great price but not ""whisper"" quiet. It's not loud or anything and I'm a light sleeper firist part and can still fall asleep to it but it's not as quiet as I thought. I have to turn up my tv every time its on and unless its very hot I'll turn it off just to not listen to it anymore.",0
3,Noise level is higher than expected.,0
3,Loud. Even louder when on oscillation mode,0
3,Not a lot of power for Caribbean summer,0
3,"It’s louder than I thought it would be. Attaching the base wasn’t hard, but I did end up putting it on backwards despite reading the directions.",0
3,It doesn't take up much space but the highest setting feels like it would be the lowest on other Lasko fans,0
3,This fan was disappointing. it works but the level of air is laughable in comparison to other fans.,0
3,Only lasted 3 months,0
3,Mixed silicone by weight. Couldn't get it to weight the same equal size pour. Accuracy just isn't there.,0
3,"This scale is much smaller than I expected, including the buttons and display screen.  Feels rather cheap. It even gave me a reading of .4 grams,  Right out the box!  I reset it and it still did the same thing, so I returned it.",0
3,"Bought for the intention of weighing reptiles, but its a little too small for my animal container for weigh in times.Will have to use this for cat food instead.",0
3,To small comparing with the price I return,0
3,Works.,0
3,"This scale is ok. It is veryTemperamental, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not.",0
3,scale is not accurate tested it with a 5 gram weight it weighed 4 grams on this scale. off by about 20%,0
3,"It is not waterproof, small for kitchen use, accuracy is 3-5 grams minimum",0
3,So light and cheaply made. Uses battery,0
3,I think I got a faulty item. Mine won’t turn on and I just received it today. (Yeah I have batteries),0
3,The whole scale is to sensitive. And was about .5 off when I used it,0
3,"After 5 months, I can't use tare button. It's just not working.",0
3,NOT GETTINT THE READINGS I NEED HUM MAYBE I'M NOT QUITE FAMILARE WITH IT,0
3,Accurate scale but any normal plate or bowel covers the screen and you can't read the weight.,0
3,Not balance!,0
3,really small,0
3,🍑,0
3,I had to return this because it didnt weigh the small amounts i needed,0
3,"This scale is very slick looking in the stainless style, but the design makes it so you cannot see the reading. For instance even a small plate covers the reading, as it is a small flat square, with the read out on the square.",0
3,The numbers tend to jump around a lot and I can never quite zero it out. The numbers change all the time.,0
3,I’ve been doing candle making the past few months and have not been able to measure and get the scale to read exactly 16oz. It is always 16.01oz. Therefore I believe it is not 100% as accurate as it should be. Aside from that it measures and its small and portable.,0
3,Not accurate but not expensive maybe I didn’t know how to use it,0
3,"My scale is not accurate anymore after having it for 4 months. I have used it about 7 times. The numbers are jumpy. The last two times I have tried making soap, my calculations were off because without touching it or moving the scale, it goes from .00 oz to .05 oz back to .00oz repeatedly. It won't stop.",0
3,The accuracy is fluctuated,0
3,"The product worked fine for 2 years, but then stopped working, even after replacing the batteries. It stopped being responsive and was unable to zero out.",0
3,Doesn’t scale exactly right. It really only scales swell in increments of 2 grams (not odd numbers for some reason). Gets the job done though for a low price.,0
3,feels cheap.,0
3,Very inconsistent,0
3,So so,0
3,Not accurate.,0
3,Malfunction shortly after I got it. I got it for recipes.,0
3,"Sometimes doesn’t work as expected, gives different measurements for the same thing with the same weight",0
3,The product works ok， but the quality is just so so,0
3,The button is so stiff and sometimes you need to press a few times to get the selection.,0
3,It's not perfect. It's convenient though. It's good for the price and size.,0
3,Always round up as it's not always accurate,0
3,Lacks more instructions,0
3,"Tried to figure out why all using this, still had to cook and then put in crock, why then??",0
3,1,0
3,Not working as advertised. The slow cooker is not working on it,0
3,The right size is complicated to operate,0
3,Complicated understand and use.Not as simple as I had imagined.,0
3,Did not get the condensation with my 3QT Nova.,0
3,It keeps signaling that my food is burning,0
3,"Every time I cook with it, it always has water spilled all over.",0
3,"I loved my instant pot so much, but I’ve had it a month and it stopped working.",0
3,"I would not buy this particular appliance again because the company wrote awful instructions or lack of instructions.I had to call friends and watch youtube videos to get any idea why it works the way it does.  I am not sure I will keep it as it seems to be inconsistent with its operation.  They  must be putting out new models allot because nobody I talked to, a couple of friends who did not have the model I did and all of us are fairly new to Instapot.",0
3,The product came without a user manual and condensation collector,0
3,"As an avid user of a conventional pressure cooker, I was hoping this would be a solution when I have extended stays in hotels.  Unfortunately, the 3 qt is just as large as my conventional pressure cooker (10 qt), and slower to pressurize.  I also noticed it takes approximately 30% longer to cook the same meals.  Sadly,  it DOES NOT come with a steaming basket for veggies (cheapest functional steam basket I found was $12) so add that into the price.  It is nice having the delay function, but if I knew then what I know now, I probably would have bought a hot plate instead.",0
3,👍🏾,0
3,"After 4 years, it lights on but can’t heat up. I don’t use it often, just once a week only.",0
3,I have to hold the liver to let the steam out. It is not coming out automatically.,0
3,I found this very complicated to use.,0
3,"when arrived, i found scratches on the inner container.As if it was used before.",0
3,More complex than crockpot,0
3,"I can cook rice faster on the stove. What was supposed to make life easier, made life more difficult.",0
3,"If you have time to cook, just get a regular kitchen.If you don't have time, but can plan, get a slow cooker instead.",0
3,Didn’t get measuring cup and spoon to serve,0
3,It does not have a brown rice setting.,0
3,"A lot of options, can do a lot, only issue is the pot is not very non-stick. The older pot I had was non stick, this one is not, and it’s an issue.",0
3,U have to know how to use this thing or it’s a different way of cooking,0
3,"Too small.  Too complicated.  Byvtge time it heats up, do it on the stove.  A crock pot is much simpler.",0
3,Cups are rather small. May work for others.,0
3,I did not use it for a while. It overheats quickly. Just burned today.Will try another product.,0
3,"Not all that , you’d be blending for a long while. And still not all the way blended",0
3,Its works for the mean time but if your looking for something permanent you may have to invest in something more sustainable,0
3,Smaller than i thought,0
3,Smoothies only and had to replaced with a regular blender.,0
3,It was average . Thought would be used more. Just average,0
3,Smallest than it looks and cups are small; for this price you can get larger one at Walmart.,0
3,The blender tends to have a burning smell,0
3,"This is a very small Magic Bullet. Micro Bullet, I just was not expecting it to be so tiny.",0
3,I put frozen fruit and milk in my blendor and it takes a really long to actually blend I have to mix it often to get the job done,0
3,Too less for price,0
3,I've purchased this product twice and use it daily for a blended matcha drink. The first lasted three years the second lasted a year.,0
3,"It was said that in can do for example onions, but in reality, it can't at all, neither big chunks nor small ones, unless you add water or sth juicy to it!",0
3,"I was scared the item was broke , because the box it came in was messed up.looks like someone had stepped on it, but it was ok",0
3,Pockets are very tight money clip does not hold much cash,0
3,"A bit larger than expected, money clip is really tight, can only hold a few bills.",0

3,כ,0
3,"When I went to register my purchase the QR code link they sent was out or date or discontinued. At any rate, it did not work. I am not sure I see this wallet as a long term solution but maybe my expectations were too high. It seems ok....we'll see how long it lasts.",0
3,I take my wallet out of my pocket at least 30 times in one shift at work to scan my badge. The corners quickly wore down allowing the outer material to peal.,0
3,"If you fill the wallet up, it doesn't stay flat.  It opens up into a v, taking up more space.  If you actually use the money clip, the adjacent card slots are very tight, making it difficult to insert or remove cards.  I wanted a small wallet that was easily accessible. This was neither.",0
3,Way bigger than I expected.,0
3,I knew it only held 12 cards but I thought it would be a little more flexible instead it’s tight and hard to get more then 1 card in a slot. The money holder was very tight and I had a hard time getting a card in behind the money clip.,0
3,"For the last several years ive had a very small, almost unnoticeable wallet. I thought thats what this was going to be. But it is much larger than I thought. Its basically a normal size wallet.",0

3,I thought it was black....its gray....,0
3,"too early to tell yet, need a new wallet, just have to see if this one fits the bill, so far, maybe not.",0

3,Much larger than I expected. It is thin but wide and longer than expected.,0
3,Too small nothing fits inside,0
3,I did not like the quality of the material. It was hard to determine in the pictures what the quality would feel like.,0
3,Great craftsmanship but I bought it for its supposedly sleek and minimalist design.  It failed on both aspects.  It is the same size as a regular wallet but is thinner.  Very well made but not what I was looking for.,0

3,This is my second pair of Adidas slides. Bought both in a size 9. These particular pair is smaller than my other pair.,0
3,Like plastic says cloudfoam but these are definitely not like the adilletes I bought last from adidas directly. I don't recommend them unless price is your only concern,0
3,Too small but since I dont have a car or a printer I cant return them,0
3,Very light weight material and will not hold up to much wear.,0
3,"I’m woman’s size 9, men’s 7. I got an 8 and they too small",0
3,Runs small,0
3,ALWAYS GO UP 1 SIZE,0
3,Too small.  Less narrow than a normal width.,0
3,I Got a size 10 cus im a 10 but i guess it runs small o sometin theyre to small shudd have gotten an 11,0
3,They size run way to small and narrow.,0
3,I got these for my husband. He wears a size 10 1/2 so I got the 11 in slides.Way too small and very narrow.,0
3,The toe was to large for my foot and my feet slide around in the shoe,0
3,Fit not as good as previous NB I have purchased,0
3,They don't breathe at all and will cause sweaty feet.,0
3,I wanted Swede but I couldn’t find it,0
3,"I’ve been wearing these trainers for about 20 years having bought ~25 pair. The last few pair seem to be breaking down faster with the plastic outsole areas caving in the side rear sections. Also, the soles have been separating. Additionally, this new pair came in a completely obliterated box but they appear to be ‘new’. It might be time for a new shoe and Amazon alternative.",0
3,"My previous NB shoes lasted over 5 years.  These ones just 1 year, the soles came apart at the heal.",0
3,I ordered 9 1/2 wide and when I tried them on they looked exactly the same but then I noticed one was made by Nike and the other one by new balance and of course the Nike was a little higher so I returned them both so as not to affect my hip,0
3,Too slippery too walk on,0
3,Buy the 626 instead,0
3,"There seems to be an issue with ""wide"" ND ""xw"" in New Balance shoes. I sent these back and ordered same pair in white. White pair is NOT wide either. Compared to other NB shoes; 411, 608, wide and they are ALL about 1/4 inch wider! Had the 481 XW and these are NOT wide either. Just received a pair of 840 V2 XW and these ARE NOT wide!! Seems that NB thinks 2E is wider than 4E!?",0
3,"They advertise these as leather. When we hear that we have visions of soft baseball gloves, cozy couches, top of the line car seats, etc. There is just one thing wrong with the descriptions of these shoes. The leather is not that kind of leather. It is bonded.Bonded leather is the lowest grade of leather, because it is not really leather – just shredded leather scraps and bits reconstituted with a filler and backed with an embossed polyurethane coating. It’s very cheap, but falls apart quickly. Bonded leather is found in low-end furniture and accessories, and sometimes book binding. You may also see this referred to as reconstituted or blended leather.Because these are cheap leather, I do not expect them to last long. In fact, they refuse to break in and get soft at all. Not bad to look at, but if you're expecting the full grain leather or even something soft and malleable, look elsewhere.",0
3,Made in a different country than the pair previously purchased. Toe is narrow and restrictive.,0
3,"The pair I got seemed to be factory seconds, but stores were closed due to Covid 19. So had to use",0
3,Not near enough cushion in bottm of shoe for me..went from air monarchs to these and going back to monarchs,0
3,Too tight across the toes,0
3,Item received as promised.  Unfortunately the model is not as the one advertised.,0
3,This product wears out too quickly for me. I expect more from New Balance.,0
3,The New Balance cross trainer is a bit tight for a wide cross trainer. I decided to keep them and will use them at times.,0
3,"One shoe had a pointed toe, the other has the expected rounded toe. It was too much trouble to return them. Lesson learned. Clearly this pair was not quality checked.",0
3,Could be wider,0
3,Shoe was too marrow,0
3,Sole separates from shoe after about 6 months,0
3,Feet can’t handle the dress shoes today.I have moved to tennis shoes,0
3,Very wide!! Would have returned them but through out the box,0
3,Ordered brown received black. Need brown.,0
3,Not that durable.  Only lasted 5 months before the stitching started coming undone.,0
3,They were bought for someone else,0
3,Shoe ripped at seams after six months of wear.,0
3,The ad info indicated the 12w was = to a 12 - 4. The shoes that arrived were 12w but the tag has the w = 2. They may loosen a bit with more wear but require a shoehorn to get feet into the shoes.,0
3,Basic shoes for a basic price,0
3,Too wide,0
3,I wear New Balance shoes all of the time and always wear a 10D shoe. I ordered these and the are too narrow. Returning.,0
3,"Looked for wide shoe, but this was not wide enough.",0
3,The size was very large,0
3,recomended,0
3,"They just seem to run about a half size to big. Besides that, they were ok.",0
3,Does not have the expected quality.  It is little bit hard as well. I have used for less than a year and it is starting to show signs of aging very quickly. Would not recommend this product for anything other than causal use.,0
3,Too long in toe area,0
3,"They're ok, the heel should be tighter.",0
3,"Not my favorite NB shoe because it is noisy. Comfortable, but I hear every step,",0
3,somewhat small,0
3,Too heavy and inflexible--I use them now (not intended) as work boots.,0
3,"The shoe is on the small size, and is not comfortable to wear for extended time. Hoping the shoe can stretch enough, so that I am able to wear for extended periods of time.",0
3,O.K.,0
3,Size runs big. Had to return and reorder a size smaller,0
3,"Sent a mens shoe and a womens shoe, so my son cant wear them.",0
3,These crocs are smaller than the crocs I got from the store,0
3,Second pair I’ve bought but this time the shoes was larger than actual size,0
3,Ran a little small! Another trip to the UPS store!,0
3,The length of time it took to be returned. And the next price went down 5$. n Not again,0
3,Bigger than expected,0
3,To big,0
3,Should have went a size smaller.,0
3,Size runs big,0
3,Really need to produce 1/2 sizes!,0
3,"I ordered the same size as my other crocs expecting these to fit the same. Well I was wrong, they ran significantly smaller and since I assumed they would be fine tossed the packaging etc so I can’t return. I’d recommend sizing up from your normal croc size.",0
3,"They are so wide for Med, I can't keep them on.Love the look of them, will give them away.",0
3,I bought these for my son who wears a size 14. They were 2 sizes too big! He didn’t wanna go through the hassle of a return and decided to keep them because he only wears them around the house. Who measures these shoes?? Are these European sizes or what?,0
3,Wider than i expected but very comfy,0
3,Just a tad big,0
3,"Size up! If you are a 7, get a size 8.",0
3,The size is way too large for the size I bought.,0
3,The product was not the color I assumed it would be. I thought it would be a bit darker,0
3,I read the reviews where it said that they run large and to order a size down. My toes are rubbing on the front of the shoes,0
3,Size up or youl be returning,0
3,Watch arrived scuffed.,0
3,"Wore it one time, and the black is already rubbing off of the band. Not the quality I'm used to with Fossil.",0
3,Too big of a face. Very clunky.,0
3,"First watched showed up all scratched, ordered a replacement also showed up scratched!",0
3,the date timer doesn't work,0
3,It’s an ok watch nothing special,0
3,The strap started to peel after a few months of use.,0
3,Eu kdk,0
3,Watch is very heavy.,0
3,Way bigger than all other watches i saw at the store.,0
3,band came off,0
3,I received with little scratches,0
3,"The inside gradient wasn't what I expected, I thought it'd be more ""refine"" looking... the rest is just as the picture",0
3,its bigger and heavier than i was expected,0
3,"Has a little mark in one side, this mark is not for a scratched",0
3,This is a very nicely designed watch. The reason for the 3-star review is for the stainless steel wristband. The quality and workmanship of the wristband is poor and that takes away from the watch.,0
3,it is too large,0
3,Didn't like. Face was huge. Returned it,0
3,"The watch came shoved into a metal fossil box.  The band was kinked , and where the kink was it scratched off the surface coating on the band.",0
3,There are white scratches on the watch.,0
3,"Nice looking watch. Tired of digital watches, I wanted an old school analog watch. This however doesn't have a backlight and the hands are not lumenescent. At this price, that is unforgivable. The date display is also tiny. Overpriced for what you get.",0
3,Betrry is not working and glass is some scracth,0
3,Some scratch are there!!,0
3,I got this product from Ethos watches. The case of the watch was an old one with few scratches on it. Also the watch didn't look to be a brand new. There were few patches. I wanted to return the product but I had to use that product so couldn't.,0
3,Looks cheap,0
3,"The dial is great but the band is very bad, doesnt look or feel as nice in person.",0
3,SAA,0
3,It wasn't the color I wanted,0
3,So far so good....dates needs be shown with contrast color. And all dials should glow at night.,0
3,Product received good but the packing from amazon is not good as expected.,0
3,"The pictures depict the face with all silver details.  However, there is actually quite a bit of gold rather than silver.  I thought it looked cheezy and a bit cheap.Returned.",0
3,Too big,0
3,The leather band color is a bit off.,0
3,The watch didnt come with the tags!!B,0
3,Smaller than i thought. Felt cheap too,0
3,Not expected quality,0
3,I didn't get warranty card with proper stamp and also any bill with this 😑,0
3,The product delivered is not working. Replacement made.,0
3,"Very large face, takes some getting used to",0
3,Strap color is different and looks cheap.,0
3,Avg,0
3,Watch looks great but the sharp edges where strap attaches to the face cut into wrist,0
3,Looking not branded,0
3,"Average product from fossil,Returned",0
3,The leather changed color quickly,0
3,Watch is very classic.. but back panel is very sharp,0
3,I got another model instead of it.,0
3,Dial is not blue..It's black,0
3,Color was totally different from the picture,0
3,"Not a bad looking watch. My only complaint is, that if i dont wear it everyday the watch stops. Its meant to be an everyday wear.",0
3,"The actual watch is fine and is performing well at this time ,There is nothing wrong with the band ,but it fdoes dig into my wrist sometimes ,prefer leather bands anyway which makes no sense on a diver watch",0
3,The cyclops is off a hair.,0
3,Returned. It was too small for my husband. Next time I must pull out the measureing tape.,0
3,Does not keep accurate time. I have had to reset time several times.,0
3,"Keeps time 1 or 2 minutes fast each day. In a week where it started on time,  it will be 10 to 15 minutes at end of that week.",0
3,Pin fell out of the clasp after wearing for a month. Bracelet is not covered under warranty.,0
3,They looks to cheap even for 90$ .,0
3,"Keeps time well. Perfect size for my wrist, doesn't look like I'm carrying a spare tire on my wrist likey last watch.Edit: after almost 2 months the glass starting fogging up real bad and it doesn't tell time anymore.",0
3,It's smaller than I thought it would be.,0
3,The bracelet feel cheap,0
3,cheap crystal should be sapphire,0
3,Very large band. Had to remove to links.,0
3,The watch is very accurate. The luminous dial doesn't last more than a few minutes after  being placed in direct sunlight for a few hours.,0
3,dont expect too much....the needles and dial quality is ...hm.....it just looks cheap.....very cheap...,0
3,"This watch is a little slow at first, but after two years it is so slow you can not rely on it.  It is in my sock drawer and I dont wear it anymore.  Went and bought a Casio.",0
3,"I ordered this and another Invicta at the same time (8926), this was not what I got. What I got was a 8926A and a 8926. I can't even find the 8926A on Ivicta's web site. The only difference I can find in the 2 is the coin edge on one, both are 40MM",0
3,I have to reset time and date several times,0
3,Quite heavy!,0
3,"I bought this watch for swimming and diving in the Caribbean where I spend 6 months of the year.This is the 3rd watch I am trying.The first 2 had faults, the 1st was losing time over a few days. The 2nd also was losing time but over a week.I  now on my 3rd which is working very well so far. I haven't been in water with it yet because of the pandemic I can't leave for my Caribbean swim to test it.",0
3,But not the big and heavy we use to see in invicta,0
3,It’s quite small for me,0
3,it is o.k,0
3,Lasted about 2 years,0
3,"doesn't keep the time, you sleep and it sleeps with you",0
3,"Pretty simple, however it kinda irritates my worst a little bit, however for the price it’s a good watch",0
3,Plastic junk,0
3,Cheap locks. Probably won’t deter theft. You can’t set a combo,0
3,not very theft proof,0
3,"Can't reset combination, have to use the one it comes with.",0
3,Set combination that cant be customized. You must rememer the combination that came with yhe lock.,0
3,"Description said we could change the combination, but you can’t.",0
3,It’s ok. Kinda thin.  I can’t choose to change the combination either.,0
3,Smaller than they looked on the website. Couldn't set a combo and bought 4 of them so sent them back and upgraded.,0
3,cannot change the lock code,0
3,Very picky lock mechanism,0
3,"Perhaps I should’ve read the description more closely, but the numbers go from 1 to 6. Makes it much harder to come up with a combo that I can remember",0
3,"Works fine,but way shorter than I thought",0
3,It works,0
3,"It is much smaller than I expected, but then much lighter than the second one I bought from a store.",0
3,"cheap lock, can kick open",0
3,Too small.,0
3,as expected,0
3,"Cheaply built , but does what it is supposed to do !",0
3,As advertised and able to lock up 4bikes side by side. Lock mechanism seems rather cheap though.,0
3,This lock is mostly just a visual deterrent. It's not very high quality and is very basic in functionality (you can't choose your combination) but it will keep someone from walking off without your bike without any effort.,0
3,The product I received had its insulation starting to come off on one end.,0
3,ssomewhat small,0
3,Decent lock but seems to stick sometimes,0
3,Does not seem very high quality.,0
3,"this is way smaller than I expected, its about as thin as a pencil however I gave it three stars because of price and shipping",0
3,"You can tell why its cheap. The lock looks fragile and the parts seem to be a bit loosen, but it does the job",0
3,Too small,0
3,this is a really small bike lock,0
3,Haven't used it.  Instructions are in Chinese.,0
3,I thought this would have a clip to fasten it to my scooter as did the one I had before.,0
3,the locking mechanism is a little flimsy.,0
3,Got this and another brand- this one is thinner and can't be reprogrammed with your own code. It will do the job but I'd spend a bit more to not have to remember a code and for the added deterrent of a thicker cable.,0
3,Okey.,0
3,Works for a quick pickup.,0
3,Caliber is too thin.,0
3,the chain is not very long,0
3,It is less weight than I expectef,0
3,would not real buy it,0
3,Does the job.,0
3,Cheap deterrent,0
3,it is very wound as in it coils up way 2 much but it will serve its purpose,0
3,Standard master,0
3,"It's cheap, don't expect much",0
3,"I’d describe these as the base model. They get the job done, but do not have features that other similar lanterns have like magnets or a hanging clip. Also, these are not as bright as others I’ve seen.",0
3,It was actually smaller then I thought.  I didn’t think to too at the measurements..just looking t what it could possible deliver.,0
3,One of the light doesn't close which causes it to stay on.,0
3,Thought it would be bigger,0
3,These are very small,0
3,Batteries were corroded,0
3,One would not shut off. The other worked as it should,0
3,Uses batteries instead of rechargeable,0
3,To small,0
3,Way smaller than mine thought,0
3,Output is about a 40 watt bulb.,0
3,These lanterns are comically small,0
3,"These little light's are wonderfully bright and easy to use but, when I opened the packagenone lamp worked and the other did not. I tried using other batteries than the one's sent with the light's but it still wouldn't work. 😟 sadly I have only one that works. Probably wont buy again knowing they are faulty before use.",0
3,One doesn’t work,0
3,"Came in a pack of 2.  One lantern turns off as advertised, the other does not.",0
3,One works great!......the other not so much it won’t shut off when you close it so you have to take the batteries out.,0
3,One of the lanterns works as designed. The other one will not close properly and the light never shuts off. Had to take the batteries out to shut it off.,0
3,I didn’t realize these were so small,0
3,"Ordered two 2-packs for Christmas Presents.  Three of four lanterns worked.  One wouldn't turn off when closed.Amazon sent a replacement.  But, returns are a nuisance.  So, I subtract hassle points.",0
3,One of the lamps I recieved was flawed. When batteries are inserted the lamp remains on and does not turn off.The other one recieved works flawlessly and lights up the area really well.,0
3,It works and will probably only work for a short time before it becomes landfill.,0
3,Bought two and they came with batteries. Each light has three banks of white LEDs. Each bank has two rows. The batteries go in the bottom.One of the lamps had one bank inserted poorly in the internal frame. Ten minutes to take it apart and fix it.,0
3,One of the lights did not work. A section of the lED did not work. Had to return item,0
3,Ordered 4 lights and 2 came cracked on the bottom door that unscrew to install batteries. Need them for night fishing and had to tape them up to keep battery cover on.,0
3,Much smaller than anticipated,0
3,"Only when starting directly at it.  For the number of LED's, really does not fill a small area very well.  Will be sufficient in my medium size tent, but if hung near the top, there is no light going down.  Should have 4 rows of lights instead of 3, light patterns do not overlap.  So OK, and good for the cost, just was a bit disappointing.",0
3,Used once,0
3,"Handles are too sorry,needs to be thicker or padded.",0
3,Don’t know about the battery life yet.  I use them around my smoker at this time of year due to not having as long sunlight.,0
3,"They're nice little lights but I do find the LED far too bright, it hurt the eyes.",0
3,"I would have given 5 stars but one whole light strip on of the lanterns doesn't work, so only two of the three sides lights up.",0
3,1 works 1 doesn't,0
3,"I thought they were going to be a little bit larger in size, and put out a little bit more light. But all in all they are convenient & will do the job.",0
3,too led rbight,0
3,"Really liked the product, however, by the time we got the chance to use the lights, we noticed that one of them was shipped to us broken. The internal switch that turns off the light when it is closed was broke off and you could hear it rattling around inside the light. The only way to turn it off now is to remove the batteries. By the time we used the lights, we were outside of the return window.Just make sure that when you get these, you check them out first thing. Lesson learned the hard way for us.",0
3,The bag strap tore the first time I used it,0
3,Had to return it due to its weight. I could not carry it.,0
3,The armrests side down in back when you text your arms.  Bag ripped when we tried to put the chair back in the bag.,0
3,Didn't even last a day and the thing fell apart,0
3,Sturdy but a little heavy to carry around.,0
3,The color was closer to a pink,0
3,As above. Returned it,0
3,STARTED TO GIVE OUT ON ME @ 210 LBS.,0
3,"It is not comfortable if you have normal sized legs. The seat is angled up, cinches the hamstrings above the knee and cuts circulation. I can’t sit in this chair for more than 5 mins without my legs falling asleep (due to circulation being restricted).The front support pieces for the arm rests reduce the available seating space as well, further constricting the body. This chair might sturdy and durable, but in terms of ergonomics it’s poorly designed.",0
3,The fabric on the chair arm ripped after just 2 uses,0
3,i only used the chair once. It was too heavy for me to carry as well as awkward.In order to store it in my small apartment I had to tie rope around it in two locations in order to get it back into its storage sleeve.I am 81 years of age and live alone in a small apartment.,0
3,Weighs a ton!,0
3,"I would give it 5 but it was late by three days and i needed for a camping trip but couldn't bring them because they weren't at my house in time, the day  i got home from camping that was the day it was delivered but i will just use them anyway for car shows",0
3,Impossible to get back into bag.  Not bd chairs otherwise.,0
3,I guess it's not sturdy enough for bigger people. The frame is bending on me fairly quick...,0
3,Rivet that holds the material to the back rest pole fell off after only two months.,0
3,Almost impossible to get entire chair back into the bag!,0
3,"I have used this chair at my daughter's swim meets.I think it was used 30 times at most, last week one of the corners ripped and it was unusable.I will not buy this product again.",0
3,Kinda small.,0
3,"The chair is very comfortable, but the bag ripped the first day. It ripped in the seam. It is a very thin flimsy bag. I will have to return unless the seller will send me a new bag. Not sure how to contact Coleman.",0
3,Wearing out quickly,0
3,This chair fell apart after the first year I had it.,0
3,"When you adjust The arms on the chair,they keep sliding down. It will not stay in place",0
3,Not what I expected,0
3,Carpel tunnel syndrome,0
3,Meh...it was ok.,0
3,Go try things on before you eyeball the product that you're thinking about.  This gapped and wasn't as described.,0
3,Bulkier than anticipated,0
3,I'm an average sized woman and these were way too big for me.,0
3,Difficult to make a tight fit. Need assistance to hold it while tightening.,0
3,It is difficult to secure the Velcro without assistance,0
3,Shop around,0
3,Sweat smell😷,0
3,Too big for my small wrist. Will be returning.,0
3,only receive one brace,0
3,Didn’t work as expected.,0
3,Too big for my hand/wrist.,0
3,The fabric starts to rip under heavy use after a while.,0
3,Need two hands to put it on properly,0
3,Velcro doesn't stay fastened after a couple of months usage.,0
3,"The thumb hole is small, making it very uncomfortable to wear. My hands are very small, and it's still uncomfortable for me. Other than that, it provides good wrist support.",0
3,Easy to adjust. However it’s a little bit too thick so it’s not comfortable at all.,0
3,Only use during warm weather. Our zippers keeps getting stuck halfway and coming off track. In addition the zipper fabric is deteriorating after a few days of use.,0
3,Very large vents on 2 sides that are not closable make this unusable in temps below 40degrees.,0
3,returned,0
3,Used when it lightly rained and inside got completely wet!,0
3,The tent sticks were very brittle.,0
3,There one I got was damaged and used. Think it can be a reality good one if I got a new one,0
3,it only fits one person not two,0
3,I got this last year for $53. Hmm PRICE GOUGE?,0
3,A little flimsy but it works.,0
3,The elastic cord inside the support rod broke.,0
3,"Had a year in it.when we set it up we seen, where the window mesh meets the tent meterial , it wasn't seen together",0
3,"Water did get in. It was a thunder storm but I seen it coming through the seam. But for the price, I expected it.",0
3,"If using inflatable mattress, only fits one single. Perhaps one twin.",0
3,"While it is the right size and brand, I was really looking for a tent where all of the windows zipped closed instead of relying on the rain cover.  It will work, but not what I thought that I was buying.",0
3,Walls of mesh,0
3,Tent arrived in one piece - barely. The box was completely opened and dismantled. The tape holding the box together was stripped halfway off.,0
3,"average quality, poles seem very fragile.",0
3,Not rain proof,0
3,haven't,0
3,Not waterproof!!! In a rainstorm you must use a tarp!,0
3,Tent leaks when rain gets heavy,0
3,Lid leaks a little and perspiration gets on lid making it wet if there’s ice inside.,0
3,"One band, very little resistance",0
3,That were smaller than I thought,0
3,The loops are too small.,0
3,3 of the bands have always busted within weeks of using them.,0
3,Excercise,0
3,My husband has been using the yellow band and it busted on him during a workout last week.,0
3,These are not for thick thighs. They start above my knees end up mid-calf in seconds. But they work in every other way.,0
3,Not right wnough,0
3,Durability could be better- the first band broke after 1 use,0
3,"Not what I was looking for, the resistance give way about halfway through pulling it.",0
3,"These are fine. They are good for the price (4.99) but if you are a serious band user and exercise regularly you'll quickly discover these have limited use. They need to be more snug for exercises that require placement on the thighs - they slide down constantly because they are cut too wide. Plus while it claims to offer a range of resistance by providing so many bands, they are all more or less light to medium. I ended up giving these away and buying the brand I used before but is three times the price.",0
3,The bands are pretty narrow and flimsy and easily roll up making them more annoying than useful.  I spent half my workout trying to keep them from rolling.  The heaviest bands were better but not what I needed for some PT foe hip issues.,0
3,Inexpensive but didn't last long.,0
3,Didn't last long,0
3,Regular,0
3,Too flimsy,0
3,"They work decently, but they roll",0
3,These rolls with your work out. They're a little flimsy. But they work.,0
3,"The product is ok, but not what I’d hoped for.  They are much smaller in size than I had anticipated.  I thought they’d have been bigger.  I am using two of the bands regularly to strengthen my foot.",0
3,The bands are too thin and too small (circumference). But...better than some out there.,0
3,"I like the quick delivery. I don't like that the bands are thin and stretch too much. I expected to get the type that I used at my former fitness gym. Instead, I'm using only the black one, which is the heaviest weight. The other color bands lack resistance.",0
3,They roll up on your legd,0
3,They cause me to itch and the rubber stinkd..,0
3,The bands are to thin and aren’t durable,0
3,Bands are very small,0
3,"There is not a whole lot of stretch to these bands, but they get the job done for the basics.",0
3,They rolled around quite a bit,0
3,I'm using them to keep my ankle weights on,0
3,Very small and cheap.,0
3,As expected,0
3,These are not like most bands very thin and okay if you have never used bands,0
3,Not made for big thighs at all,0
3,Rolls Up,0
3,I bought these and I realized that with time they ripped apart I didn't even use them a lot. Invest in thicker bands.,0
3,Exercise!,0
3,This product was too weak compare to the others ones that I have tried.Although it comes in all different sizes and colors which makes easy to differentiate.,0
3,I thought the heavier bands would have more resistance,0
3,Too thin!!!Rolls down,0
3,They roll down constantly,0
3,I had to buy a different set from another shop. These ones kept rolling up on me. Indo have thick thighs. Just didn't work for me,0
3,Bands tend to roll up while completing a work out. Gets the job done but lots of time spent repositioning.,0
3,"I thought they would be a bit longer, but I would make them work.",0
3,Bands often slip and do not stay in place,0
3,"I think the bands are a little to large and not tight enough.  I am a big person (6'3"") and I find the bands to be too loose and too weak.  I wish they were stronger and tighter.",0
3,Waiting to hear if there is a replacement coming.....,0
3,"I have these for about 6 months now. I only use the red and black. Occasionally I use the yellow for arms. I, so far had no issues. Yes, the lightweight ones do roll up. The heavier ones less and it really depends on the exercise. To avoid rolling as well as to improve some excercises I use different heavy bands for legs. None of them snapped on me yet. I do make sure to put some baby powder on them so they don’t stick. Be careful of asbestos in baby powder. Try getting those based on cornstarch rather than talc",0
3,Slips up automatically after i put it on.,0
3,I purchased these in April. I only use two or three for simple upper body exercises three times a week. Two of them split and one split completely apart while in use. I have sent emails to the company and have not gotten a response .,0
3,Keeps sliding off my legs. But other than that it does the job.,0
3,These will work if you're new to working out but they don't provide the same amount of resistance as some other brands.,0
3,It ain't too shabby,0
3,One size does not fit all.  The brace is not made for larger people.  Probably works well for a smaller body type.,0
3,Doesn’t seem to make a change in standing tall as expected.  Because u have it on it is a reminder to stand tall but doesn’t make a difference for me,0
3,I am not able to get this on.,0
3,It works but not that great. I thought that it would be a little more strong I guess.,0
3,It does not stay in place,0
3,"Positive, is I could feel a slight pull to straighten my back. But negative is it is not comfortable the Velcro rubs right under the armpits and it would be better for a strap support across chest.",0
3,No pain relief.,0
3,This brace basically just pull your shoulders back. It don’t really help slouching. You will still slouch just with your shoulders pulled back. If the brace ran down a bit lower on the back to give some support to the back it would be gr8. Felt uncomfortable as the straps run under the armpits,0
3,The Velcro straps did not slipped off underneath the straps below and dug in to both armpits.,0
3,The product was exactly what I expected to be. Not dissapointed at all. Stick with it and you will see results!!!,0
3,Was a little too small for me but would work if you were shorter,0
3,"I've been using this for about a week for various amounts of time each day.  It does seem to help correct your posture but the straps that go under your arms make it uncomfortable to wear for me.  I was hoping to be able to wear this under a top, unnoticed, but the wide straps make that impossible.  I will still try to use it since my posture is in need of help, I'm just disappointed that this isn't ""comfy"" like the name.",0
3,Under Brest uncomfortable need to be more supports,0
3,Can wear about an hour before it gets to me..,0
3,It doesn't give the support I needed.I ended up giving it to someone else & they have since passed it on for the same reason.,0
3,Itches my back but works,0
3,item was kind of small. Somewhat hard to get on by myself,0
3,So so.,0
3,"I am a bigger man. Some muscle and broad shoulders. After expanding it as far as it will go it still digs in at the armpits, even if I move my scapula close together. I can see it working for more petite people, but if your shoulders are wide it is going to be rough.",0
3,I just received the product and it seems to work fine.  My complaint is that the it sits to high up on your neck so if wearing a t shirt it's very visible.  I want to wear under my clothes so it's not viable to others.  I'm sending this back and ordering anther style.,0
3,Not that soft. I ordered a softer one after.,0
3,"I’m 58 years old and have been playing volleyball sines the age of 12. Indoor and outdoor (beach) this ball is very slippery, and quality very low. It feels like plastic cover. It’s not soft at all, but vey plastic feeling in my fingers. Don’t buy, look for a better quality. I believe it will be cracking after been used for while. Still really bad.",0
3,Not that soft enough for beginners,0
3,It did not hold up to outdoor use,0
3,First one I received had a hole in it.,0
3,"While the volleyball is exactly as pictured, it is not soft at all.",0
3,Not soft at all,0
3,"The name ""Softplay"" is incredibly misleading. This ball is harder than most. It's a shame, because the color was really beautiful. At least they accepted my return and refunded me promptly.",0
3,Not as soft as described. Leaves marks on arms.,0
3,The ball popped the first week.,0
3,Deflated way to fast,0
3,The ball came very flat,0
3,It had a scratch on it,0
3,👍🏼,0
3,Advertised as soft but just the opposite,0
3,"Peeling after a few uses.  If you can find a ball in the same price-range (and you can), get that instead.",0
3,"Its a volleyball, found the exact ball in walmart cheaper",0
3,It's called soft play but it is actually hard on the hands,0
3,Not particularly soft compared to other volleyballs.,0
3,Not that soft! It really stings our forearms!,0
3,not really round,0
3,it is not elasticity,0
3,I ordered 12 of these volleyballs and 2 of them are always going flat.  I have to pump them up every other day to be able to use them in practice.,0
3,"I got the ball with in two business days. It was what I ordered, the only thing was it was advertised to glow in the dark and it doesn't. I wouldn't have paid so much for it if I had known ahead of time it doesn't glow in the dark.",0
3,"I bought it for the price but is has a ""cheap"" feel to it.  I just needed to have a volleyball in the camper so this will do the job.",0
3,Light weighedNot my favourite,0
3,Socks shredded after one wash,0
3,"I ordered size 8-9, however, the heel of the socks are actually very visible. When they arrived, the band they were wrapped in was marked L.  Anyone who orders these needs to think small.",0
3,"I followed the size guide, but these socks are way to small.",0
3,too hot for Miami!,0
3,Thin,0
3,Size 8-12 is too tight for 12 size feet. I bought the larger size and will see how they work.,0
3,Size and quality was not as much as I expected,0
3,"Bought for husband but it was so tight and small, I kept them since I had smaller feet. Also the back part of the sock slides down.",0
3,Ok nothing special,0
3,"Would have given more stars but, it arrived 2 days late. Two days past the delivery day that I was told to expect it.",0
3,Shorter lifespan than other socks I've purchased. But initially they are comfy.,0
3,Too short in the back,0
3,They are socks.,0
3,Pretty disappointed - socks tend to roll off the back of my heel. They're also on the thicker end of running socks.,0
3,"The socks are made of quality material and are very soft, however they are too small for my feet (size 12) and I bought size 13-15.",0
3,Website says sizes are 8 to 12. They are actually 9 - 12.,0
3,They are too thin.,0
3,"Because of the writing on the sock, it appears you have two right feet.",0
3,"very short, not suitable for washer.",0
3,"Reviewing these based on what I received. Did not get what what in the product picture nor do I feel these are ""black fashion""",0
3,Very thin,0
3,they shrink so much after 1st washing,0
3,The description said size 8-12 but when it arrived it was size 9.5-11.5. Too big.,0
3,I have a pair of  Saucony socks my father gave me. What a difference from my regular socks! These must be a different type. I would say they are in between the two.,0
3,I thought I was getting 12 pairs for $25. I got 6 pairs. I got 12 individual socks. Who labels sock counts individually?  12 pairs for $25 is reasonable. 12 socks for $25 is a rip off.,0
3,Material is very thin.,0
3,these run small.  I am a mens 10.5 and these are slipping off of my heel.,0
3,"I found them to slide down the heel when walking, they are not really stitched in a way to keep form.",0
3,"kinda thin, kinda slick, not for distance running",0
3,They are on the small side.,0
3,"Decent socks, but they shrink a LOT.Get the next size up from your shoe size.",0
3,There were holes in these socks after only a few (heavy duty) wearing.,0
3,Sweaty...,0
3,"I wear size 11 and they are slightly small. I will wear them, but I wouldn't buy them again.",0
3,There was a thread pull in each sock. Makes me wonder if they are seconds.,0
3,Just got them.  Sock size is standard large 10-13.  I took the 9.5-11.5 reported sock size literally and tried to convert shoe size.  The 9.5-11.5 is men's shoe size.  I wear an 8-8.5 and they are a bit big.  Wearable like others that say 10-13 is 8-12.5.  Look at reviews.  Some on both ends of the spectrum complain about size.  So if you aren't 9-12 shoe size you will probably mind a bit thinking the sizing is off the mark one way or another.,0
3,A bit small below just below the ankle for my size 10 men's foot.,0
3,Not perfect due to the sewn toe.  If that doesn't bother you then they wear well.,0
3,Too small and they haven't been washed.  I'm a size 9 men's sneaker.,0
3,I would rate them as ok.. A little on the thin side.,0
3,a little big,0
3,see above,0
3,Doesn’t count steps accurately,0
3,"For this price, I expected faster UI, more accurate pulse measuring. It costs a lot but gives you the same what you can get from cheaper device.",0
3,The Fitbit charge 2 lasted almost 3 years. My FB 3’s lasted about a year This Charge relentlessly asks to track my location no matter what I do in settings. It awards “zone minutes” that are not the amount of time spent exercising.  Accuracy has not improved from my experience but there is an onboard GPS for running.  I always get the protection plan in case it lasts more than a year and buy on sale because these are basically disposable.,0
3,"Unable to read while in the sun, it doesn’t always read sleep",0
3,I only gave this fitbit 4  3 stars because even after charging battery to 100% you still can't see the screen. Not happy with this fitbit. The fitbit 2 was much better.,0
3,"I like this device overall.  It's simple, easy to use, and the whole FitBit ecosystem is great.  But I just can't get over the poor GPS connectivity.  Regularly, I get about halfway through a walk or run, and the GPS will randomly stop working and a message saying that the GPS signal couldn't be reached pops up and then GPS turns off for the remainder of the workout.  Also, apparently trying to start a GPS-enabled workout right after a previous one, will not allow GPS to work either.Sure, I understand that this happens sometimes.  But when it becomes a regular thing, it's enough of a pain-point that makes me want to get a different tracker.  Hopefully they can fix this with a firmware update or something in the future.",0
3,Like the product but hard to charge.,0
3,My third Fitbit. Can’t seem to get this one working correctly. Spent an hour with customer service. Still not working correctly,0
3,"Too big, especially for smaller wrists and not enough options or styles to change bands. Wrist placement is very finicky for accuracy",0
3,Very dark sometime you can’t even see it I don’t keep track right,0
3,Does not work,0
3,Battery does not last long.,0
3,My band cracked after 6 months and I filed a claim. Still waiting for a month to receive it.,0
3,This is my second Fitbit I like the app and the sleep tracker but the charge battery is a shame... now I can’t charge anymore and I can’t use it. Fitbit need to find another way for charge the battery because the actual that is like a Clío didn’t stay in place and not charge the battery. I am thinking to change model.,0
3,Harder to use than older versions,0
3,Doesn't count most residential flights of stairs.  Need to fix the cut-off on the altimeter,0
3,Sleep tracking is up and down,0
3,"We used to have fitbits ages ago, and wanted a simple way to track our activity again.",0
3,this watch was not compatible with my Kindle.  I returned it!,0
3,Battery does not last as long as my charge 3,0
3,"I used my Fitbit to track my walking and biking.  But, The straps will not attach anymore.",0
3,My second Fitbit. This one crapped out within two months.,0
3,Yoga,0
3,Quality reminds me of something I could get a walmart or dollar general. It's ok.,0
3,A bit harder than expected.,0
3,Moves too much and leaves indents after use,0
3,Did not include the advertised carrying strap,0
3,Used to workout,0
3,Not made for use with shoes,0
