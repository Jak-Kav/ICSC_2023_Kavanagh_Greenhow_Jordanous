1,No change in nails at all.
1,Didn’t do any improvement at all.
1,"Helped cuticles, didn't do much for my nails. I gave this product a decent time line, two jars, six months. Nails didn't improve."
1,No changes!
1,"Took me over a week to get rid of the red, itchy allergy this product caused. My rating would actually be zero stars.  All the ingredients were not listed on the information I read."
1,"Not sure why other reviewers gave such high ratings. For me I don’t see any change whatsoever. I’ve applied as directed every day each time I washed my hands and you know with the virus I’m washing even more. My nails continue to chip, peel and crack."
1,This product did not work for me. I see no difference whatsoever. It is just an overpriced Petroleum jelly.
1,I couldn’t get the smell off my nails! If it came UNSCENTED it would be great. It made me AND my husband sick to my stomach 😢😡
1,"I’m pretty sure this dried out my nails, I don’t have issues when using an oil but while using this I had more breakage which is a bummer because I was excited after seeing the ingredients. I’ll stick with cuccio m&h, I regret straying!!"
1,The box was damaged and there was supposed to be 2 jars in it. only 1 was there
1,I do not like the smell so I don't know if it works or not
1,The product did not work for me.  My nails are now worse than before I started using it about three months ago.  I still have splits and cracks in my nails.
1,It made my nails worse. They are so soft now they just rip off no matter what I’m doing
1,No
1,Apply daily and my nails are almost getting more brittle they are in terrible condition. The product did not help whatsoever
1,This didn’t help my nails. They were still dry and brittle. A waste of money.
1,Made my nails worse!!
1,Made my fingers peel and left them sore.  Saw no benefit to my nails.
1,"Used it for a month and saw no difference. Doesn't work, my nails are still soft, break and peal"
1,No change in nail hardness.
1,Didn’t work as expected. Very disappointed
1,"I guess it's moisturizing..I only used it once for about 10 minutes ..IT STINKS..very strong smelling..not vanilla , not coconut , was it bad past expiration not sure could not place smell..on to next thing.."
1,This has Formaldehyde and that is bad for nails. Not happy this label was not shown
1,"Despite using this product for over a month, my nails have not improved.  They continue to crack and chip daily.  For me it was a waste of money."
1,"Smells horrible, did nothing for my nails and left my hands feeling greasy to the point I had to wash it off. Between the small and the feeling of this stuff I would get nauseated."
1,i have been using for appox. 3weeks NO IMPROVEMENT
1,All the reviews for it made me believe it would work. I used it for over a month and it did nothing to my nails. They keep breaking and are still very weak.
1,I was diagnosed with dry nails by a dermatologist.  This product had no effect on my nails.  I applied the product several times a day for over a month without any change.
1,Unpleasant odor. Used 3 times per day for a month with no benefit.
1,Product was not effective.  Used the entire jar as directed.  No visible difference in nail quality.  Nails are still tattered and without any visible positive change after using this product.  I have the empty jar
1,Poor product. Not worth the $$.
1,"This is basically lotion. I bought them because one of my nails splits down the middle and I am a guitar player. This did not help me. What's worse is that although I only ordered one, I received two and was charged for both of them."
1,"this product has made my nails start to lift from underneath, I'm unsure if it is an allergic reaction to something this product but now my nails have skin peeling from beneath my nail and very itchy fingertips. I had to go get medicine to stop the itching and used aquaphor to relieve the skin breakage. I do not recommend for anyone with sensitive skin."
1,"Smells real nice, but my nails haven’t gotten any better. They still break and chip and crack. Won’t be buying again"
1,I tried this for a 4 weeks and honestly I think it made my cuticles really dry. I have extremely dry skin and always have and this doesn’t help at all. I gave it away to see if someone else would like it but I wouldn’t recommend this to anyone who has very dry skin and cuticles. It didn’t help my nails get any harder or grow either.
1,"This product does NOT smell like coconut. It reminds me of the hoof my dog used to chew on. It might have worked if I could have gotten past the smell, but I couldn't use it 3 time a day."
1,Gave it time to see if it would work but my nails are still weak but It is moisturizing for the cuticles.
1,"I don’t understand the other reviews but this product cracked and chipped my nails. I had to cut them all off due to peeling and chipping. When I stopped using it my nails grew back no peeling, chipping or cracking. I decided to use it again and it started peeling and cracking."
1,"It makes your nails worse unless you use it every day multiple times. If you stop for a while, they become weaker then ever."
1,My nails are still cracking. No good.
1,It is more than one and half a month I am using this product.. unfortunately I didn't recognize any changes to my nails
1,I was not impressed with this product it did not meet my expectations.
1,"Unfortunately after using this product, I did not see any improvement in the strength or thickness of my nails. The worse part is that most of my nails, after extended use, formed a break on the side far down in the mail bed. So even if I did have some length on my nail, I was forced to cut it off. Many of them had to be cut well into the fleshy part of the nail, so then it just looked like I was a ""nail biter"". I did stop using this product & started it again to determine if it was the product. I got them same breaks on several nails (all at once) only after using this product. So I feel it's safe to say this product does NOT work for me."
1,"I loved the smell and texture of the product, however is had a horrible negative impact on my nails. My nails became very soft and the the tips were peeling off in layers. It's taken me a month to get my nails back to healthy after discontinuing use"
1,Notice no change in nailsAt this time have to say purchase was uselessSave your money
1,This is not the same one you’d buy at the stores the consistency is sticky and gross. It’s not oily or even near the smell of the correct product.
1,Not even a good moisturizer in my opinion
1,Unfortunately I have been using this product for six months and my nails have not grown and are as brittle as ever.
1,Pls Pls Pls don't waste your money!!!!!  This stuff is NO GOOD!!! All my nails on my left hand broke off.  Now I'm stuck with this dollar  store garbage and out of over $8  STAY AWAY
1,"I ordered this for myself and my friend and we have never had so many hangnails. We gave it 2 months and still terrible hangnails. This supposedly was supposed to be good for cuticles, we have not found this the case. Very disappointing."
1,"After all the good reviews I was excited to try this.  Have tried so many things - biotin, Collagen (which seemed to help the most and then stopped helping), coconut oil, Hard as Nails - and nothing kept my nails from splitting and peeling and breaking.  Some nails have vertical lines which did not go away.  I was determined to use it at least 3 times a day and was very disciplined about doing so but, alas, the more I used it the worse my nails got until I had to cut them as short as I could right down to the flesh.  I guess it works for some people but not unfortunately not for everyone."
1,"Very disappointed in this product. Nice smell, moisturizes, thick. Just doesn’t do what it’s advertised to do. My nails are still getting ridges, splitting, and easily broken after ten days of use as directed. Not recommended."
1,Yuck!! The smell of this is SO bad!! I couldn’t even leave it on to test it out it was so bad. I would never buy this again. Garbage is where it is now
1,Smells horrible. Wish it was unscented. The smell makes me nauseous.
1,Product smells nice but did not strengthen my nails at all.
1,The smell is so bad I can’t even use it. Do not recommend
1,This product does not work. As soon as I put it on I need more. Sigh! I’m so tired of spending all of my money with these products that don’t work.
1,Did not strength my nails at all! Still flakes and broke
1,Makes my cuticles very dry and hard!
1,"This didn’t strengthen my nails at all! They might’ve broken more than normal. This is nothing more than a lotion. I was hoping for something with actual results. I even used it multiple times a day as it suggested!  For now, I’ll go back to Hard as Nails since it actually does something!"
1,Product did not strengthen nails but made them weak and constantly breaking.
1,This product caused my nails to literally start tearing off at the tips it had the opposite effect it was supposed to and now my nails are burning. I’m not sure if mine was defective but I can’t recommend this despite the good reviews.
1,"Was excited to use this as I've had a hard time getting my nails to grow.  After using this for a week my nails are softer than ever and keep splitting and breaking.  It's going in the trash, so disappointed."
1,"Used the entire container, nails are no better than at the start. Useless."
1,Used two months no difference
1,"Horrible, waste of money. Does not work at all"
1,Don’t like the smell!Also don’t think it did anything for me.
1,I saw no difference in my nails after using this product continuously for several weeks.
1,Did nothing to improve my nails.  Waste of money.
1,I've broken 2 nails since I started using this about 3 weeks ago.  I haven't noticed any changes in my nails. THIS was  aWASTE  of  $$$ for m
1,Didn't like
1,"Complete waste of money and did nothing at all, just a bunch of grease in a cup. I used it consistently and nothing at all happened, don’t even bother."
1,Makes tissue swell if you touch face.  Causes allergic response topically.  I am not sensitive to products or have allergies.  Be aware.
1,I don't know if this product is effective.  I only used it once The extremely strong and musky perfume gave me a very bad allergy attack and migraine headache.
1,"The ""cream"" was Used and very hard. No opportunity to use it. Nor that I would buy it again!"
1,Waste of money. Nails still splitting.
1,"Package arrived ripped open and somewhat taped back together, and the product was cracked and damaged. Post office marked package as having received it damaged. I’m extremely unsatisfied and bothered that such little care was put into the shipping of the product, am returning."
1,use that stuff constantly put it on my fingers constantly  just kept cracking and splitting down the middle it was terrible.
1,"I have been using this product for over a month.  So far I have no improvement in my nails whatsoever.  They are still brittle, lined and look, I think even worse.  A big waste of my money."
1,"This was a total waste of my money & time! Despite applying the product as instructed, my nails became weaker & kept breaking at the tips."
1,"Showed no improvement for nails. After putting on 3-5 times daily, for weeks nail still peel, bend and tear."
1,"Not doing nothing for nails. Seems to be making them weaker and splitting, cracking and peeling more."
1,I bought this product based on other reviews that said it helped to strengthen the nails. So far my nails have broken more now than ever. Waste of money. Will not purchase again.
1,"It did not work for my nails, no improvement"
1,Does not absorb.  Very strong coconut fragrances. Prefer the Healthy Hoof.
1,The texture was hard like the product was old and hard to get out thr container. I used it for a few months with no results in nails or skin around nails sadly.
1,"Awful. Greasy. **Terrible** smell. Disappointed; this was hyped to be ""THEE"" cream to get ... WRONG!"
1,The product did not work at all. My nails are the same ):
1,I would not recommend.  My nails are now splitting and peeling after using.
1,"Used it for two months, no results at all.Didn’t work for my nails ☹️"
1,"Could not stand the smell of this product. I did persevere, but I saw no difference after about a month. I ended up throwing it out."
1,"Ugh. Can’t stand the smell! Makes me nauseous. Because it smells so bad I’ve only used it twice. I was hoping I could get used to the smell, but it’s just not possible. I can’t comment on how well it works, otherwise."
1,"This is terrible, does nothing as states.How can people write that this product was good"
1,It’s been a month I’mUsing this  product butDid not see any difference at all :(
1,Did not strengthen my nails
1,Have been using this for a couple weeks now and nails worse than when I started... very dissapointing.
1,I didnt have a problem with my nails growing but they wouldn't get that long before chipping and breaking. Since using this my nails are way worse they never bent in half like they do now! They wont even grow now as soon as they get past the skin they are tearing away I'm so upset!
1,Consistency changed from creamy to hard crumples after a week making it useless
1,Been using for two weeks and I actually think my cuticles are drier than before I started with it.  Scent is bad too. Save your money.
1,"Used this product 3 times a day for a few weeks.  Did nothing to existing nail.  Polish would peel right off - jar states ""works over nail polish"".  Disappointed."
1,Threw this a way in three days. Dried out my cuticles like nothing I’ve ever seen. Horrible. I was so mad I didn’t even ask for a refund just threw it out
1,product didn’t work as expected. I applied the product I stated in the directions. This did absolutely nothing to harden my nails or soften my cuticles. It was moisturizing as any other type of cream when I put it on but had no lasting affect.  Find something else.
1,"It smells wonderful but I developed a really nasty rash after using it for about 2 days.  I was very upset because I can’t return it.  It smells amazing, and moisturizes so well."
1,Did not help my nails one bit!
1,"I have used it consistently for two weeks and my nails are no better, split and break.  Scent is very nice. But I don't know what else to say, but so far, no good for me."
1,I love this brand and have many of their polishes and builder gels and I love all of them. But unfortunately my no wipe top coat bottle was dry and empty. I dont see the option to contact seller about it though.
1,"MY NAILS STARTED TO LIFT, THICKEN, SEPERATE AND TURN YELLOW! It’s so painful and disgusting looking DO NOT BUY THIS CHEAP GARBAGE IT WILL RUIN YOUR NAILS!!!!"
1,It is impossible to remove and broke my real nails
1,I only used these once and won't bother again. The application was fine and my nails looked fine when I was done but in a day or 2 it yellowed so bad I had to file it off and use my regular trusted brand.
1,The No Wipe Topcoat had congealed while it was in the bottle.  It came out with a big clump of gel attached to the brush. After I pulled it off there were still hard pieces stuck to the brush.  I watched a lot of videos on this product before buying and the topcoat was smooth and said to even be a little thin. This was the opposite of my experience. I can't use the topcoat.
1,Both the brushes HARDENED as soon as we started to use them!! We have purchased many topcoat and basecoat and never did the brush hard in like a rock very disappointed I want my money back
1,"I had a horrible reaction to this gel. The first few times I used it were okay, but then my fingers blistered and peeled and my nails separated from the nail bed. It was very painful and took months for everything to grow out and return to normal."
1,"Please do not buy this product. First time using it, once I was all done (even cured my nails under light four times) it came COMPLETELY off. Worst formula ever. Do not waste money!"
1,one of the bottles came completely empty.
1,"After using this one time the top coat became very sticky and became a little hard, totally unusable! I don't know if I received a bad bottle or if it was old but unfortunately I would not recommend this product."
1,"Unfortunately this product fits the saying, you get what you pay for. Cheaply sold, cheaply made."
1,"I have tried so many brands of top coats and they all seem to dry out the brush in no time.  Very frustrating.  I've had good luck with this brand in nail polish so I thought I'd give them a try but I'm disappointed.  Once the brush is stiff you might as well throw it away, it's useless!"
1,I don't like this top and base. wasting of my money
1,Dislike
1,So clumpy! Very disappointed especially in the top coat. Opened for first time and defective
1,My nails were infected from this and my nails are separated from the beds...will not ever purchase again
1,"The polish have a nice shine and may or may not last - I've been unable to leave it for even a week the 2 times I've attempted to use it. I am not using any harsh chemicals or anything that would stain them. It is the polish. Easter/early Springtime and I'm attempting to use pastel colors - unfortunately within a day or 2, my nails look dingy brown/grey.. I can remove some of the discoloration by scrubbing with an alcohol pad - but I shouldn't have to do this daily to keep a manicure looking nice. After scrubbing the stains off 2-3 separate times, they continue to look dingy, dirty, discolored.I'll try to continue to use what I have, but only over dark polish.I would not recommend"
1,So disappointed the clear coat started peeling/lifting after a few days
1,"the top coat literally does not last long at all, within A DAY it will wear off and the paint on the corners of my acrylic nails fades off and my entire manicure gets ruined within a week😐"
1,Leaked everywhere. Such a mess. Had to throwaway.
1,"This top coat is awful. It peels off after a couple days. I used a different top coat on my other nails, and this is the only one that has peeled off."
1,"Really disappointed, my nails peeled and chipped the very next day. Don’t waste your money."
1,Bottles were broken at the cap. Bottles spilled out the contents. Was not able to be used. Very disappointed
1,"I am so disappointed in my purchase. I was so looking forward to a good base and top coat gel polish.  I like the smoothness of both but after the first manicure, I opened the top coat gel polish and the brush was hard as a brick. I tried everything to clean it, but to no avail.  Therefore, I could not use it again!  I had to improvise and use a different brush that another company had sent with other orders I had made in the past.  Still, not a good way to work on your nails.  I just don’t know what or who is reliable to order my nail products from.  This is not the 1st time this has happened to me. Different company...same results.  I understand that the gel top coat and base coat can over time get hardened but I had just bought it!  Should have lasted more than one usage.  Waste of money."
1,This product was dried up completely in one bottle and almost completely dry in the 2nd bottle. So I couldn't use it at all. So not sure if it works or not.
1,I had an allergic reaction to at least on of these products. So if you are allergy prone try another brand
1,Horrible product and turned the nail polish color a weird blue tint!!!
1,The top coat leaked and the top will not come off. What a waste of money
1,Complete garbage. Doesn't cure and remains tacky. Waste of time and money.
1,The worst it turns blue then green leaves yellow tinge gross
1,If I could I would give it 0 stars. This product is toxic crap. It caused burning and cracking of skin and onychomycosis (a fungal infection of the nail) that is still giving me problems with my thumbnail three weeks after using it.
1,I use plenty top coat but this is the worst by far
1,"Thus is awful top coat, when it deys under lamp, it is blotchy and if you put a 2nd coat, it will dry like it has missing polish in spots."
1,I hate this product. I have used this twice and I’m throwing it out. I got a little of the top coat on my thumbs- after the gel set my skin burned- peeled and was totally painful. Tried it one more time and now one finger raw and burns- worst ever!!
1,I got this product because I am a beginner at doing acrylic nails and I thought this gel polish would be good. These hell polishes smell very chemically and as soon as i put my nails in to cure my finger nails starting burning. I thought it may have been my nail lamp but it was not. I do not recommend.
1,This top coat sucks. It gets so cloudy and it doesn’t shine
1,I use Gel polish all the time this must have been miss manufactured as it simply doesn't work after you cure it it leaves tons of spots that never cover the nail.
1,Doesn't work. Peels clean off
1,The brushes arrived hard and dry! Very disappointed in this product.
1,I was finishing my nails with the top coat when the brush just turned hard. My AC was on and I guess the slightest breeze dried it out. Can no longer use unfortunately. Bottom coat seems fine
1,"Used it twice. By the second time, the product had already become a useless gooey substance.Waste of money."
1,Nail polish always peels off. Gave me a nail fungus and causes water damage. Destroyed my nails. AVOID!
1,"It is clumpy and didn’t even dry all the way through, now my nails are smudged.Está muy gruesa y no se secaron bien mis uñas."
1,"Poor quality - even after basecoat dries, it remains sticky, and all kinds of fuzz and hair stick to my nails. Returning."
1,Not happy. Top coat dried up quickly and brush fell out. Very disappointed. 😡
1,The nail brush applicator broke on the first use. Horrible. Cheaply made.
1,"This is, hands down the worst gel polish I’ve ever used. It won’t let my gel polish dry no matter how long I leave it under the UV light. It’s so messy and takes forever to dry. DO NOT BUY!"
1,Horrible does not keep product on my nails
1,The base coat works fine but the top coat does not seal. Little gaps appear and there’s no way to get rid of them unless you use another top coat over it. Which defeats the purpose of getting this too coat
1,"Polish was awful, it was thick and difficult to apply because it didn’t flow from the brush...it globbed. I did use the curing light-thinking it might kind of smooth out a bit??  and it took 4-5 mins  (supposed to take ONE minute!!)  to make it “seem” ok but it never did completely dry. HUGE waste of my money and my time"
1,This is the worst gel I've ever used. Doesnt really fully harden.  Peels off. Not durable at all. Do not reccommend!!
1,Updating my review**** it leaks and it rusted off so it’s constantly leaking and it got thick not good !
1,Received today and not sure if this is oldProduct but I can’t get the top coat bottle open not sure but it’s definitely defective
1,Horrible product.
1,"I used this product once without any problems, but on the second use my fingertips started to itch and burn. I thought maybe it was because I got the top coat slopped over (which I usually do) so I waited until the next day to decide if I needed to remove it from my nails.  That morning my fingers were itching and fingertips really sore and hot so I quickly removed the polish.  That was a week ago and my fingertips are still sore. If you have any sensitivity in your hands, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT!!"
1,Was very upset with this product...too thick to use. seemed like it was old and sitting in the bottle for quite a long time will not buy again
1,"FOR SOME REASON THESE DID NOT CURE , I had them under a 64 watt led lamp for over 5 minutes and they didn’t not cure ! They remained sticky , waste of money!"
1,I’ve been using gel nail sets for quite a while but this base coat really sucks. It’ll move and clump up on the middle of your nail so by the time you get to your pinky your thumb has to be brushed again if you want full coverage. I haven’t had this problem with other gel base coats.
1,"Does not come off well, damaged my nails every time."
1,Didn’t work well at all
1,"Don’t buy this!! My fingers hurt so badly, severe allergic reaction! Not okay"
1,This gel nail polish clogges up on your nail. It doesnt smooth out on your nail. It's clumpy. Not very good. I wouldnt recommend buying this product.
1,After a lot of trial and error with other base coats this one just doesn't last. It chips after only a week of wear.
1,This is crap. It’s too thick and leaves lines no matter what. The price may seem legit but these are junk and start gumming up
1,Horrible product it never dries and smudges almost instantly !
1,So I thought this was what is being used at nail salons but the quality is not similar. It is very poor quality and very disappointing.
1,Terrible product.. doesn't stick to nail bed
1,Awful product. Turned yellow and green within hours.
1,Terrible product. Doesn't last more than three days and it leaks when laying on its side.
1,"I hate this product.  I dont just dislike.  My fingers are hurting very badly tonight. I spent all evening trying to get this off. It is still on my nails. I soaked and soaked in acetone. I even ised a toothbrush on them while soaking them. Would NOT come off. Used a chemial called magic remover and it burned me! I can NOT GET THIS OFF. im so disappointed in this product. I do not reccommend.  I say run! Dont read more. I cant even redo my nails, i have to walk around with this clear base coat on me for no telling how long. This is horrible.  My fingers are so so very sore and stinging and to be stuck like this is horrible."
1,Piled off literally the next morning :(
1,It was used once and about 2 weeks later when I used it it was dried out. It worked Great the first time but very upset it dried out so quickly.
1,"This base coat was unbelievably bad.  It applied smoothly (to freshly washed & cleaned nails that had been wiped clean of residue with alcohol), then as it cured it drew together into raised rivulets, leaving other parts of the nails completely bare. It also went spiky, with little points all over it that gave it a texture like there was sand mixed in. Needless to say, this did not provide a smooth canvas for my manicure, and when two coats of gel polish over it still couldn’t completely smooth it out, my only choice was to put a glitter overcoat over everything to camouflage it. So unimpressed!"
1,Gave me THE worst allergic reaction!! I’ve never had my fingers burn so much!
1,Not good dont buy this
1,"The bottles were almost empty  in both colors, the brush had to be in the deep bottom to be able to have some gel on it, big dispointement."
1,"I looked forward to this product based on reviews. I was disappointed.  It left bubbles, wouldn’t apply evenly, top coat peeled, base coat won’t come off completely, turned my polish brownish, and left my nails damaged."
1,"I bought the base and no-wipe top coat because the price was so reasonable.  The top coat I give five stars.  The base coat is horrible.  It was difficult to remove, which I can live with, but it discolored my nail horribly.  I threw it in the garbage!"
1,"Hate it, bottles are small and it doesn’t even dry even under UV light & I only put one coat."
1,Don’t buy this polish. The top coat has a yellow color and discolors all polish underneath. I was very disappointed!
1,Disappointed with the color.
1,"I have been using gel polish independently the last several years. After using this product twice, my nails eroded and fell off.  I am in extreme pain. Do not buy this product, it is awful!"
1,Not a good  product
1,"Received this duo yesterday, sit down to polish my nails today...and the base coat bottle is empty!!"
1,"Unlike the first one I purchased, this set of gel polish had a scent, almost like a skunk. Very dissatisfied."
1,"Even with the top screwed tightly, the base coat dried in the bottle after the first use."
1,"One of the bottles was broken and the gel was hard, I'm returning them"
1,"Poor quality, was only good the first few uses. Base coat became thick and does not go on smoothly at all. Product quality changes over very short time. Would not recommend. Both me and my sister are allergic to this product. After some use it causes nail bed pain and inflammation."
1,This doesn’t even last I will spend an hour doing my nails the next day I can peel the whole thing right off!!!! What a waste of money!
1,Horrible this lasts me 3-4 days then they come off from the bottom and sides
1,Was very excited about this product so I could play with my new nail powders. However when the box arrived the product box was beaten up and the top coat was completely  missing! The shipping box was untouched and none of my other products were missing or damaged - just this one. Very disappointed!!
1,Not good at all. The base coat doesn’t stay uniform right after you apply it on your nail. It starts leaving blanks and moving! So you have to start reapplying it on each nail and trying to cure it as soon as possible. Top coat is not good either. Doesn’t cure properly even after a longer lamp use. So it’s a little wet and ruins all the layers done. I’d ask for a refund but obviously I’ve used it. Don’t recommend at all
1,"The first few times I used the product it was great, but now I get horrible allergic reactions if I use it. My fingers are swollen, insanely itchy (to the point where I couldn't even sleep), and very painful if I hit them on anything. I threw my gel away! Not worth it to buy cheap gel."
1,"I have used this base coat and no-wipe top coat twice, but no more. I had to leave acetone on for 45 minutes and then scrape off which damaged my nails. They both have an unpleasant smell and my fingers did have a slight burning sensation while curing with an LED lamp. I have three Aimeili color-changing gel polishes and like them; using Gelish base and topcoat, everything removes easily within 15-20 minutes."
1,"I like to keep my nails short and clean. Inpreoped my nails before applying the base, and this gel polish. A couple days later...my fingertips started feeling numb and a bit painful. There were no cuts or any open wounds before applying the polish. The only thing I can think of, is my cuttingy nails short and filing them. I googled to see if there were any known problems and found one case where a women had nerve damage after taking her nails in to a saloon and having then done,using the Gel polish. According to reviews and labels...these things are very toxic with a lot of chemicals! I'll be discarding all the gel polish I purchased and will stick to the regulars. Now I need to see a Neurologist to see if there are any damages. :("
1,"very clumpy and thick, hard to put it on evenly"
1,messy leaking bottles =(missed return window
1,"Do not like, it is very thin."
1,It peeled off within 2 days of application. I followed directions exactly. So disappointed.
1,very bad quality
1,Doesn’t dry and smudge after the fifth time curing it. It smells horrible that it caused me headache. Don’t buy.
1,These are nice looking but possible the worst cutting nail clippers I've ever used. They take a lot of pressure to even get through the nail and leave a jagged edge. I read some amazing reviews and perhaps I just got a bad pair but this pair sucks.
1,These leave nails chipped e v e r y single time. Would NOT recommend or buy again.
1,"After only 2 years, these clippers both rusted and broke"
1,You won't be happy with these.The cutting edges - top vs. bottom - do not line up and will will give a terrible cut.Amazon gave me a full refund and didn't even require a return.I'd say I was not the only one who found these to be defective.
1,Product took way to long to get and the last set did not work good for very long.
1,These are garbage!  They cut extremely rough. You can saw through things with your nails after using these clippers.
1,"I didn't care for these , toe nail clipper wouldn't even cut my fingernails."
1,"Does not cut well and blades are too thick. Clumsy to use. Decided to return, but the return window had expired. 😞"
1,"Glued on scratch pad fell off after a couple of used. Though it cuts, it is dull for clippers even after soaking nails. Unimpressed."
1,Very poor quality and performance.
1,Had them for about two years. The double clicking on both large and small clippers that other reviews mention is legit. It’s annoying and doesn’t always give a clean cut. The pin in the small one just gave out. Time to go back to the grocery store ones I’ve had for 10 years.
1,No better than cheap Walmart ones.
1,"I put the nail clippers on a key chain and the handle is so loose that is always turns sideways in my pocket.  It is too bad because the blades are sharp and the clippers work well, with the one exception that it opens up in the pocket and becomes a total pain.  Maybe I got a defective one."
1,Not any better than cheap clippers.
1,"it is heavy and thick, not able to reach deep in the nail. The two edges are not aligned at all, even worse than those in the dollar store."
1,Not great.
1,These things are dull! They can hardly cut nails and when they do they are jagged and catch on everything. Will not recommend.
1,Maybe I got a bad nail clipper but even the first use would cause my nails to break off and I would jab it on something and it would pull apart.  I hate these clippers ughh
1,Based upon info I thought these clippers would be special! Not special just more expensive. Would not recommend!
1,"Should have read the reviews first. Mine, like many others, did not line up well. Instead of biting through my nails it folded them and broke them. Not comfortable at all.The powder coating is thin and scratches very easily. Mine scratched and lost paint where the handle folds over and pivots on the first use.Had my wife try them to see if I just forgot how to use clippers. Same experience for her as well.Returned after one use. I’ll stick with my cheap Trim brand clippers from Target from here on."
1,Not for thick Senior nails. Doesn’t open wide enough and hard to hold onto while using. Very disappointed can’t recommend.
1,"I am very disappointed in this product. The clippers are hard to hold because they are pretty short so there’s not much to grip. But the worst thing about these clippers is that the blades are SO DULL. My nail felt so jagged afterwards because of the dull blade, so then I had to file each nail which is not something I generally want to spend time on.  They came in a little carrying case but the zipper on the case broke on the first day and we had to use pliers to pull the sides of the case apart."
1,Clippers broke after 3 months.
1,"These are low quality. There cut well for about 4 uses, after that they cut poorly."
1,These are simply terrible. They cut poorly and unevenly. I tried them because the brand I used to buy on Amazon was discontinued.
1,"I paid extra hoping for quality, but I did not receive quality. I was replacing clippers that are 11 years old (I got them in high school). The old worn-out ones are sharper and better than these. Clipping with the large or small clippers in this pack leaves me with split ends. My nails have broken several times since I bought these and I’m am so disappointed."
1,My husband does not like the one for the fingernails.  Very difficult to manipulate and leave sharp edges and easily cuts way to short.  The larger one for the toenails does not cut through thick nails for him.  He does not like this set at all.
1,"There's something wrong with the overall engineering of this product. Both the small and large one has the same problem. They just don't give you the crisp and instant cut feeling in a single move. Instead, you feel like it bends your nail and cuts it, and makes this weird sound at the end. I think the thicker the nails get, the bigger this problem becomes. I don't feel it as much when cutting my children's nails."
1,"I don't like this item. It is too expensive for what it is. It breaks my nails instead of cutting them, leaves jagged edges. Unfortunately, my return window has closed, and now I'm stuck with a $14 nail clipper that I'm not satisfied with.I tried reaching out to the customer services, they were great and tried to help by sending me another clipper, but I had the same problem."
1,Very bad quality
1,Not happy
1,Disappointed. Even the large one has a narrow opening so it is hard to cut my big toe nail. Would NOT but again nor recommend.
1,Very heavy and hard to use.
1,Even tho they are hard to hold (too strong for senior) I have used tried to use about three times.  It just is not a good product. Then today I dropped the large clippers and they broke. The little pen came out and now I have nothing!I have had to long to return to Amazon but should be able to get a refund cause they are guaranteed.
1,Not sharp at all. Grip is horrible and slippery. No good.
1,beautiful box but alas no clippers inside!
1,I am appalled by these clippers being as poorly aligned as ones I bought for a buck at Walmart years ago.  You aught to be ashamed to sell crap like this at such a high price.  I was hoping to get a better clipper.
1,not $14. may be $4. It is hard to cut my nails
1,The clippers are more tearing my nails than cutting them. After using these clippers you see white lines across the end on my nails that are rough and jagged. I have used the clippers three times so this is not from use.
1,These are as bad as the ones for a dollar at Rite Aid. I thought if I invested a little.more money in them they would last a while longer than cheap ones. Nope I was wrong they are crap just like those are. Very mad that no one makes a good pair of clippers that do not dull after one use.
1,Very rough edges on this clippers and they don’t cut well. Not sure why so many people give it high marks. Should have gone to Walgreens and gotten their clippers instead...
1,Big advertisement but nothing different from the really cheap competitors  received in a box that had been returned and sent to me. Would not recommend
1,I was crazy about these when I first used them and bought several pair for my family but they do not stay sharp but for a couple of uses. So disappointed!!!
1,Horrible clippers. Dull from the start. They have trouble with even thin nails. I have arthritis in both hands and I have to press way too hard to cut. Rated a 1 because I couldn't give a 0.
1,It broke in a few months
1,Toe clipper is useless.
1,These clippers are terrible. They break the nails rather than cutting.
1,Did not like it. Didn’t clip well.
1,"nothing to like, inaccurate, clumsy, and a waste of money."
1,"This is the second Harperton clipper set we've purchased.  In both instances they illustration of the clippers made them seem very large - good for difficult fingernails and toenails.  Instead they are smaller than any clippers we've every had.  This time I'm returning the clippers (too late for the first pair-no receipt left).  Very, very disappointed!"
1,"Weak, can't cut at all. Very disappointed"
1,"Large & bulky. The odd overbite design of the clipper creates horrible flakey edge when cutting. Absolute worst clipper, do not buy. I litterally threw out old clippers and pulled them out of the trash to use after buying these..."
1,"These are just like normal drugstore clippers (at half the price).  And they don't seem to cut right, leaving burrs and jagged edges.  I'll keep trying them but I may just chuck them and go back to the corner drugstore.  Very disappointed from the hype in the ads."
1,"The product seemed to be used already. Likely, it was returned and sold again. Very unhappy and not willing to use it on myself due to hygiene concerns."
1,These where very very Dull
1,Cutting is in inconsistent. I bought a Target product (Revlon) at 1/6 the price that does a much better job of trimming my nails. Harperton is a waste of money.
1,Did not clip well.
1,Clippers are out of alignment and cut terribly for me. Would return them if it was an option.
1,Very hard to cut nails except to do a jagged cut - not a nice clean trim.  Very poor and dull.
1,"This is not for people with arthritis in their fingers. Same as the drug store products, only much more expensive. Handle is a little wider, but you still need to exert a lot of pressure to make a cut, even for fingernails."
1,Avoid these! Very stiff and hard cut; resulting in very jagged sharp edges. After several tries and after return date: just threw them in the trash.
1,These seem to be no better than the cheapest kind you can find.  Very disappointed!
1,It's very slippery and does not work like a regular nail clipper.  I had to give them away.  Sorry!
1,The nail clippers are so sturdy that they were impossible for me to use.  I couldn't press them to clip my nails.  I had to used two hands which of course defeats the purpose.
1,I received a badly crushed nailclipper box with two nail clippers that had nail dust or fungus or something. I am afraid to use them. Will be sending back.
1,Do not recommendNot good on toe nails
1,The absolute worst clippers I have ever bought! Wouldn’t cut at all! I threw them away shortly after I got them. Buy the cheap pair because at least they will work!
1,After less than 20 months of use both nail clippers have fallen apart. I would not recommend these.
1,"Did nit like anything about this product. Someone else is selling the same, same that I purhased last year, was NO GOOD!"
1,"The blades slip of each other after cutting through a nail, making them dull after just a few uses. You can even hear it happening, as there is a second clicking sound immediately after clipping a nail.The file is also awkward to use on the smaller unit."
1,"i purchased this because of positive reviews. i was very excited to try it. unfortunately, it came with defective spray. tried so hard pumping the spray hoping to try the the scent but nothing came out. ordered a replacement and this time it works, but i was disgusted of its scent it doesn’t stays long plus it’s very oily on your skin. i won’t recommend.."
1,"Not for me, gave me skin rash"
1,"There was no scent no longevity, stain your clothes with the oils. Very disappointed."
1,Terrible  a waste of money. Does not last  and does not work. Plus  will stain clothing
1,Stinks. Doesn't work
1,The product came Uncapped and  It leaked .all over the Box I believe the little straw was too big to put the lid on all the way
1,"This bottle came in half full. I didn't take it out of the package until over a month after I received the package. This is my second time buying because i liked the sent, but very disappointed that somehow i received a partially full bottle."
1,This is a hoax and is nothing like the pheromone that it claims to be. I would not advise anyone to bet on this product!!!
1,Wouldn't buy again... It has little to no scent. You would have to drench yourself to smell anything. I've sprayed myself alot and asked a couple friends if they smell anything and they don't. Not worth it. Maybe I got a bad bach but I highly doubt it
1,It sucks
1,Smells weird
1,Does not work.  I had women smell directly and no effect.
1,Dislike frangance
1,Sucks don't buy. I'm a good looking guy with a good personality but this sucks
1,"Worst product i ever bought on amazon, i normally don't write reviews but this product made me regret that i bought it. First of all its water down perfume. Second the price they are charging for 1 oz is crazy.Just my 2 cents."
1,This product and it's reviews are ALL LIES. I wore this for 3 nights straight and my Wife didn't even notice the scent. This product is complete trash. It's a thick oil base and somehow fades within 10min. DO NOT even waist your Money on this complete and Utter Nonsense of a product!
1,"Didn't like nothing about this cologne,  no complements at all .. no one notice it"
1,"This product doesn't have any effect for me, I've worn it and absolutely no attention from females at all..."
1,"Lasts for 10 minutes and that’s all and it has a weird after smell. Almost like a bad after taste with a food, this has a weird smell after"
1,Came completely empty
1,Normally I don’t put a negative review but after spending 30+ dollars this thing is nothing I mean literally nothing no smell no fragrance nothing.it was wasit of money or I got the bad bottle.
1,This stuff is absolutely horrible! This crap wouldnt attract flies! Don't waste your money..
1,This is obviously a scam
1,Doesn’t work. Wife could careless.
1,"Really I believe that this product is not as they describe it, the smell is bad, and it does not attract women, it make them run away from you and if you are married your wife will hate you for your smell and it gives you a headache"
1,Did not like the product at all. Smells cheap...
1,It stinks. I couldn't even go near my husband long enough for the pheromones to do anything. I had him wash it off immediately. He didn't like the smell either.
1,Purchased twice because the pump broke on the first one. Save your money it's a SCAM for OVERPRICED snake oil!Damn stuff just attracts FLIES!!!!
1,basically not smell at all . very disappointed !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,I received this product and I am not satisfied with it. It has no odor at all and I believe this is a bad product. I am terribly dissapointed I purchased it.
1,I didn’t care for the smell at all.
1,No longevity. I don’t like this product
1,"I will write my comment and my opinion which is personal opinion.I will start by explaining my very, very BAAAAD BAD BAD experience.Before I thought about buying the product I read all the comments which I find somewhat strange that the negative comments were very few and they are 2 or 3 comments. After trying the product, I discovered that it is either incorrect comments or it is marketing comments onlyNow I will talk about the product1-The smell is so bad that I could only use it once for a trial and I will never use it2- Some comments have stated that the smell is mostly citrus, The smell is not citrus and I do not expect that their sense of smell is healthy3- Packaging as they stated that it is a fine and luxurious packaging The packaging is very normal, but the design of the packaging is good and not luxurious.4- Will I waste my time and money again on the product: It will never happen and I will not waste my time returning it againNote/ Finally, this is my personal opinion and experience"
1,"I bought this to impress some women at work, each one of them told me I smell either like a dead person or a low class hooker"
1,don't like  product does not do what its stated to do
1,Sucks
1,This is fraud. Absolutely no scent....really guysThis should never be on Amazon shelfIt’s not a cologne or perfume. I don’t know what it is
1,Almost made me stop buying on Amazon.I wanted this to be good. I hate returning things because its hard with my anxiety.Sorry for negative review.
1,I didn’t like the smell at all. All I can say about this perfume is that it’s a scam and please don’t fall for it. Don’t ever buy it.
1,I was curious to see how my spouse reacts. She said she hated the scent and didn't feel anything special.
1,I coudlnt use this product at all. Every time i used i had allergic reaction to it.
1,Had no smell and received Frozen
1,Awful
1,Not one good thing to say!
1,Product is greasey to the touch when applied. The scent is not very appealing and it does not last. One of the worst purchases from amazon.
1,No effect and the scent isn’t great
1,Nothing special at all
1,Scent lasted all of 5 minutes I don’t recommend this product.
1,"The sprayer clogged up after about a week. I didn’t see much action with this at all, it was yet another fail. Still open to find a product that actually has some effect."
1,Smells bad and doesnt work
1,"Did not work for me, gave it a couple months try. Smells decent like a regular cologne, followed directions but no cigar"
1,Didn’t like it. It was a waste of money.
1,Not wise to assume body chemistries are the same.
1,Not good product!!
1,"No effects at all, no ladies around noticed it, just money wasted...."
1,Theres no pheromone listed in ingredients. These guys are liars
1,"Nothing special, does not last more that 30 minutes"
1,Just not worth the price even just as a regular Cologne.
1,Not working smell is not good
1,Doesn’t work at all has no scent and no effect don’t waste your money
1,It was terrible order to bu
1,"I didn’t like it at all, it almost has no smell."
1,This is a joke. Doesn’t work and every person tells me it smells terrible.
1,I don’t like perfume
1,Bunch of crap. Never have I bought something and felt like I'm being suckered like I did when purchased this snake oil.  Waste of money.  Rather go back to buying scented oil.
1,This perfume is good but it’s leaving huge stain mark on my shirts.First I thought I am putting on too much but it happened to be on 4 different shirts. It feels so embarrassing when it’s give visible stain on cloths. The stain will go away after washing off the clothes but looks bad on the day we are wearing perfume.I would not ever waste my money ever on this brand.
1,Product stinks and a few girls said it awful smelling !!!!
1,this is a pretty bad item no smell at all.
1,This was the worse stuff I have ever bought. Didn't like it at all
1,Dumb to even think it works
1,Awful. Doesn’t last long at at all. Sprayer didn’t work properly either. $30 is a lot for something for cheaply made.
1,Received the bottle cracked and spilled inside thw box so the bottle is empty!
1,It is an oily garbage which doesn’t long last for 30 minutes. Don’t waste your money. It is a scam
1,"I really love the smell of it but unfortunately it doesn't stay more than an hour. $30 for this litte bottle,I would expect it to stay longer!"
1,"no scent , had the girls sniff me and they couldnt smell anything either"
1,The scent was so gross. It smelled awful.
1,Its a waste of money to buy a product where the scent only lasts about 15 mins. I thought the reason to use this is so you can smell it????
1,"If pheromone means people look at you like ""What the hell is that stench ??"" then yes this product is LOADED with pheromones"
1,Very much disappointed. Embarrassingly leave stain on shirts. Scent stays for very short period. Not recommend for buying.
1,No noticeable effect on my wife
1,Such a waste of time and money....... tried and it's an uture failure as fragrances.
1,I don't know if it's good or not but the smell stink . Update 09/07/2019.So far I don't see any difference  .I will update  In a few days.
1,Not worth your money
1,There is no smell this was a waste of money.
1,The smell was AWFUL. Took all day to wash it off my skin. Had the same smell as the yard spray attractant to train dogs to poop in the desired spot. I threw it away the same as I did for the dog attractant. Sorry but I had to pass on my experience which was truly disgusting.
1,Its very weak and did nothing
1,I can’t explain how this really works.  The oil didn’t last long and the bottle is not secure for this stuff.
1,Worthless and no scent
1,Scent disappears almost immediately
1,No like this is
1,Watered down waste of money. No scent whatsoever
1,No good
1,Cologne I purchased is defective. It will not spray. Pump is Defective. Amazon will not accept returns on cologne. You have been warned.
1,This is not what it says it is. Same bottle same packaging but it doesn't smell near the same. This is horrible. I will never order cologne from here again can't be sure what you're getting. This is not it. Money down the drain. If this was really nautica voyage it's gone bad like sour milk.
1,A complete waste of money. Smells like alcohol.
1,"Mine came with a broken spray pump!Amazon won't return because it's a third party seller. But fulfilled by Amazon! I don't get it when the bottle came defective. Not sellers fault.I had to pry the top off and put a cork in it for a top.It still smells the same, just a pain in the A**....Thank you Amazon :("
1,Came defective and no return policy.
1,I smells bad in my opinion and continues to smell bad all day
1,Useless scent. Not much effective during the sweaty day! Does not last long.
1,This has to be the worst thing I have ever smelled..
1,bad
1,"You get what you pay... in this case a really really cheap spray that makes you wanna rip your clothes off. Keep your hands off this product, not worth the money."
1,I don't think this is the real brand product. The smell is really bad and it looks like I can't return it nor get a refund. Very disappointing.
1,Not fresh smelling. No return available. If I had known that I would not have purchased. It smells horrible like b.o
1,"It is one of the most over rated product. I Was about to return it , unfortunately it is ineligible. So disappointed, the scent is so odd. I don't recommend this product at all."
1,This is the worst smell!!
1,"Stinks, too powerful,repels"
1,Smelled terrible
1,Cap is broken on arrival.
1,It is fake my grandpa has the real and they smell different
1,I think this is A FAKE one. The scent doesn't last at all.
1,No scent at all just alcohol and that's it
1,Not a very good scent. Only lasts about an hour.
1,Not good smell
1,Product showed up broken and leaking. Never again
1,Defective bottle . The top is not properly attached and comes off when trying to open and when not in use .
1,Scent lasts for two minutes then is gone. Fake. Not able to return.
1,Didn’t smell like one i bought in store
1,This is the worst quality perfume I have ever bought.
1,"This must be a fake,  the scent is very faint and dissipates quickly."
1,"I buy this cologne frequently, when I saw that they now offer it in a larger bottle, I bought it.  Unfortunately it doesn’t smell the same as my other previous purchases.  The scent last a few minutes.  I feel it’s a fake.  Contacted customer service for a refund."
1,this product was a waste of money!! all the smell is in the bottle!!
1,WASTE OF MONEY - I literally put 20 sprays of this on (I counted) and no one could smell it.
1,Smells bad. Scent lasted for less that 10 mins. Better off going to the store and buying a real nautica colonge.
1,Unfortunately the spray on the bottle started off difficult and got worse from there.  It no longer works and my Dad is left with a just about full bottle of cologne. Disappointed because I cannot exchange it like you could if purchased in a store such as Macy's.
1,Smells absolutely awful. That's all I can say...dont purchase!
1,I buy Nautica all the time and this doesn’t smell like the others I’ve bought. The smell doesn’t last past lunch time and I douse myself in it before work. I’ve used twice as much as I normally would. Not thrilled. Definitely wouldn’t recommend.
1,Don’t waste your money. It is fake.
1,broken glass container..👎👎
1,I didn't like it. It doesn't last long enough
1,I dont understand how they treat this as a perfume spray. its pathetic smell. I am completely dissatisfied with this product
1,"Fragrance is nice, but do not recommend for longevity.  Within an hour of application, fragrance is gone.  I even tried much heavier application than normal."
1,Fake don’t buy
1,This is a not good.......
1,"Okay I don't know why so many people buy this. There must be bot accounts because although I'm new to cologne, this scent is so freaking bad, dude. Like it smells like a men's bathroom at a Chili's. It's not entirely horrible, you can smell a tiny bit of fruitiness but the smell reminds you of ass. This is the cologne Mr.Krabs would use because he is cheap and he thinks this smells expensive."
1,This is the worst scent I ever smelled
1,smell bad and didn't last long
1,Ordered this product and first day I got it the spray shoots straight out and not a most like all cologne is
1,"The top came undone and went all over my bag! So much for a good price, it was a horrible experience. All my toiletries in my bag were damaged."
1,"The smell is good, but it is veeeryyyy weak and doesn't last long, not even for an hour.!!"
1,"I have purchased and used other Products by Nautica , and was satisfied ... this has a very unusual scent very weak ... and after it is on for just a few minutes it has NO FRAGRANCE not that the fragrance was anything yu wud want to linger  ... I was thinking it might mellow to something pleasant ... NOPE just disappears ... i do no think it is the genuine product ... I can no imagine them selling this to prospective customers ... it is as though i just threw my money right out the window ... very disappointed , actually i am very PISSED OFF ... i hate to waste my resources ..."
1,I can't believe. It smells like a spray for after shaving purposes and has a disgusting smell. I have no clue why it has so many stars. Don't recommend at all !!
1,Very cheap smells awful. Knock off. Don’t recommend.
1,Good scent but lasts about a minute...don't waste your money
1,Terrible. Do not believe the reviews
1,"Wanted this to add to my rotation, smells like  rubbing alcohol and I regret buying this"
1,This cologne smelled watered down. I think it's a FAKE!!!
1,Nasty
1,"My girlfriend hated the smell, and the lid leaked."
1,"The scent of this literally reminded me of my uncles farm growing up. Brought me back to the days of manure. And then we can’t even return it! That should be on the  ad, posted where everyone can see it readily. Waste of money!"
1,Does not smell much better than axe
1,smelled awful and couldn’t get a refund.
1,Horrible scent!
1,I knew it was too good to be true....fake fake fake fake fake
1,"Decided to change it from the usual brand, give this a try its ok smell didnt last at all waste of my money"
1,"It smelled bad, could not use it."
1,FAKE .
1,Very bad. Lıke a fake. Also no return!!!!!
1,Smells so bad I can’t wear it. Plus they won’t let me return so I guess it’ll be a gift to someone.
1,this  Nautica voyage  is horrible  potent stuff three days later still smells on  your shirts
1,i wouldnt recommend it
1,"WHEN I RECEIVED TO THIS PRODUCT, IT WAS DAMAGED AND IT HAD ONLY 1/4 OF THE BOTTLE WAS FULL. I WAS VERY UNHAPPY AT THIS TIME AND I JUST THREW IT IN THE GARBAGE BEFORE IT DIDN'T WORK."
1,"It smells bad, yuckkk! Thank Gosh it doesn’t linger to long! Don’t buy it!"
1,This is a knock off it smells nothing like it should
1,Product did not have a batch code on the box or the bottle. This is a prime indicator the cologne is a fake. The scent itself was not the quality of other bottles of this cologne I have purchased.
1,It is a fraud. It doesn't smell like anything. completely false
1,Lost smell and turned to alcohol after about a month.  Seems to be a fake. Amazon alerted about this issue.
1,FAKE DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY
1,"I purchased this product by good faith of the 12,000+ reviews with almost five stars. This product is awful!!! Unfortunately we can’t return it. I am beginning to really wonder about amazon reviews and how legit they are!!?? This is the WORST smelling cologne! Nothing pleasant about it. Buyer beware!"
1,This cologne dont smell more than 5 mins waste of money
1,It arrived with a loose stem and is useless.It is a non-returnable item and I’m stuck with some thing I never got to use. Sucks!
1,It's LITERALLY had no smell at all!!
1,"Weak scent, doesn't last. Not authentic. I prefer a light scent but you can barely smell this fresh out of the bottle sniffing your skin directly. I have no problems with imitations but this is a very weak imitation."
1,Smellz bad
1,"It is terrible, Is all alcohol. not worthy."
1,It was garbage cheap smell me or my son didn't like i use it for air freshener for house
1,"This product has NO SMELL TO IT!!!! None! I only bought because of all the reviews. I do not understand how it got so many good ones. It doesn’t smell good or back, there is nothing to it. Like spraying water!! Just wrote Amazon an email hopefully they let me turn this no return item!!! Horrible"
1,i basically got water in a bottle. wasted money.
1,"this does not I repeat DOES NOT..smell like the one i would get back a couple of years ago, the smell of this makes me sick and gives me a headache like nothing i ever experienced. This should be illegal because its dangerous. It make it hard to breath, like some comments say it smells and has the effect of sniffing strong rubbing alcohol!"
1,I can't tell you what it really smells like here cause I don't swear. Stay as far away from this as you can. It's got to be a knockoff and even a knockoff would never smell this bad.
1,you get hat you pay for!  the cologne was inexpensive and it smelled terrible.
1,It's really useless. It doesn't last at all.  Smell is not nice.
1,"Smell isn't great and even the small scent that you notice would vanish in five minutes. On top of it, clothes are stained due to this. Waste of money and I'm sure this is a fake product."
1,It's a FAKE PERFUME!! Doesn't smell at all. People don't buy it. I should have listened to other recent reviews. Don't know it's got so many votes and yet 4.5 stars. Doesn't look legit to me.
1,wasted my money this is fake  its like applying rubbing alcohol to myself
1,"This is not good product, even if you give free of cost it’s waste."
1,Smells fake. tried to return it
1,Every thing was fine the bottle is defective. The top spray part came out of the bottle. The worse part is u can’t even return the item.
1,"And not in a good way !  Last time I will ever buy an aftershave based on reviews. Gee, my dog doesn't even like it.Now I have to figure out what to do with the stuff."
1,"Must have received a fake; very faint smell, barely lasts. Alas..."
1,"Horrible smell, DO NOT BUY!!!"
1,"I decided to give this product a try after reading reviews. I Really wanted to like this cologne especially given that I like other Cremo products, but This one is terrible. It is not worth the money. Scent less all of about five minutes and what little sent is there isn’t good at all. Also this product is non-returnable. So that basically means that you’re thrown $20 away."
1,Honestly it smells the same as AXE spray which is absolutely disgusting. You can't return the item so keep in mind. I wonder how they got so many positive reviews. Either people who like this one never smell anything other than AXE or they are paid to give postive reviews. This one absolutely disappointed me 1/10 to the point I had to wash my wrists immediately after the test.
1,"I don't understand what's up with all these positive reviews for the ""Bourbon & Oak"". Unless they're happy to be acknowledged by their local skunk community, the aroma is atrocious.The only thing going for it is it's long lasting...VERY long lasting.As soon as the Amazon box was delivered I hastily opened it and sprayed twice on my wrist. Since then my wife has left me, my cat won't enter the house no more, preferring to remain outside and take it's chances with coyotes. Colleagues at work maintain stringent 24 feet social distancing with me.I can't return it, because they (Cremo) want to be rid of their current stock of this vile smell.On the bright side, it may come in handy on those Thanksgiving and Christmas family gatherings when one the family elders decides to pass out, instead of arguing which one of us is to give mouth to mouth resuscitation, a spray or two of this fowl concoction would revive and reanimate any corpse.Cremo would fare better if they were to market this as their solution to self-defense. If you're planning to take a stroll in the city at night and are worried that you may be accosted, mugged, beaten or raped, rest assured that one whif of this scent would send your would-be assailant legging for their life. If it happens that your assailant suffers from loss of smell, then it would be a good idea to have the bottle with you as it may come in handy to hurl it at him.Save your money.I'm still in the shower trying to scrub off the smell from my wrist. They're not kidding it's very long lasting."
1,It has a bad after smell to me.
1,Don't like the smell
1,Watered down no scent after 30 min
1,"Tbh, the product was damaged and Somehow I was able to manage to use."
1,Took me 30 minutes to wash off. Smells just awful
1,very mild perfume & does not last more than 2 hours.do not recommend
1,It doesn’t smell good at all.
1,Not for me and can’t return 😔
1,Do not buy this item you CANNOT return it for ANY REASON. The Spice and Black vanilla smells HORRIBLE. NEVER purchase this garbage again.
1,This smells like Deepwoods off nasty
1,"Cremo, this smells like something you can get at Walgreens. Totally embarrassing when someone asks who’s wearing cheap cologne. Unfortunately I cannot return so this is trash. Thank you!"
1,Stinks
1,"I was shocked by the smell, I expected it to be an attractive smell according to what I read in the comments, but unfortunately, it was a big shock. don't waste your money for this"
1,It has an odd scent  - not natural at all.  More like a cleaning product.  The scent does not last very long.
1,Smell was so terrible after had this had bad headache ...Dont recommend at all
1,"I am not even kidding, I opened it, sprayed it once, and immediately threw it away.As someone who loves vanilla smells, this smells nothing like vanilla OR something that any man would ever want to smell like.It smells like someone took some REALLY BAD old-lady perfume and mixed it with some REALLY BAD old-man cologne and called it a day.  I mean, it stinks...horribly."
1,"Worst cologne I’ve ever bought , scent lasts for about 10 seconds , never again , for the price I got screwed !"
1,"Boy did this scent give the worst headache. Sprayed once in the air and it’s still lingering after 4 hours in a ventilated room. Smells exactly like the price I paid for this cologne, cheap! Someone else’s review compared it to axe body spray, I think he had hit the nail on the head with that one!"
1,"This smells like the weird guy in church everyone warns newcomers of. It’s kind of sweet but musky, idk. Not a fan. Cool bottle though."
1,No good smell...
1,"Horrible smell, very loud"
1,Just smells like awful cheap cologne. Had to get rid of it!
1,You get what you pay for! This fragrance is cheap since it is! The scent is too citrus and the lemon is overpowering! I don't detect woodsiness or other notes. The fragrance is cheap since substandard ingredients are used! This scent reminds me of cheap aftershave from a discount drug store!
1,"If you goal Is to have a headache all day long, This is the right cologne for you. My wife said it smells OK which is her being nice and really saying she doesn’t like it. The smell really does last but if you don’t like the smell, that not a god thing.  Will never buy again!!!"
1,It just smelled awful..
1,I hate it. I regret buying it.  Very disappointed.  Smells like cheap shaving cream.  Powdery.
1,I wish I didn’t spend my money on this cologne. It wears off within an hour or so. The smell is not so great either.
1,It smells horrible. Not a “light scent”. Makes everyone nauseous
1,Save your money. This smells bad and the scent gave my husband a migraine. Unfortunately the smell lingers for quite a while. Not a good thing when it stinks. Didn’t bother digging it out of the trash to return it.
1,Just wasted money on this stuff. Smells like friggin candy.
1,"I took a chance and ordered the blue cedar & cypress cologne after thinking about it for several months. What a mistake! This concoction doesn't smell like blue cedar and cypress, and it doesn't smell fresh and woodsy. It just smells like another blue men's cologne, not too different from Nautica Voyage, which I also did not like. I was hoping the scent would dissipate as some reviewers said it would, but it didn't, and I ended up with a headache, though I used very little. Too bad I can't return it. Now I'm stuck with another bottle of cheap cologne, and my search for a fresh, clean scent continues..."
1,Fragrance was disappointing.
1,I’m not sure if these are fake reviews..This scent smells like something my grandpa would wear. If I could describe it in one word it would be OLDSPICE. Puh-yew
1,Smells like cheap axe body spray. Bought this as a gift for my husband and I will not let him wear it. We both think it smells TERRIBLE! I don't know how this got such great reviews. We got in bed and I made him shower and change because it smelled so bad it was giving me a migraine. Reminds me of boys in middle school who used to bathe in body spray. No thank you. Tried to return but is ineligible due to flammable gas. What a waste of money.
1,"Not great at all. Despite all the good reviews I’ve seen, the smell is incredibly strong and has an alcohol scent. After my boyfriend opened it for his birthday and tried it on, I immediately pawned it off to someone else. Made my head hurt."
1,"Yuck. It stinks. Seriously, I bought this for my husband because of the reviews. Those people are crazy. It smells so bad and I can’t return it soo..."
1,This cologne is very low quality and has a terrible scent.
1,Awful scent
1,One spray and it almost made me sick. Smells like bug spray. Furthermore you will be stuck with it as there is apparently no return.
1,It is sickening sweet and just one small spray permeated the house. Don’t buy this! Yuck!
1,"Longevity? You better believe it! But why do all the WORST smelling scents have such staying power? This is the absolute worst perfume ever, and it’s unreturnable. Buyer beware. It’s a horrible, overpowering mix of the cheapest vanilla, and a baby powder scent. Super sweet in the worst way. No warmth or spice. It reminiscent of a combination of a nursing home/funeral parlor/ old lady salon."
1,"Smells good but the sprayer is broken so it just comes out in a sloppy mess and and leaks down the bottle. Apparently this is a no return, no exchange item so I’m stuck with a useless bottle of cologne."
1,"Not a great product. Got hot too quick, wires started melting. Huge fire hazard."
1,"I have blow-dried my hair every morning since handheld hair dryers were first sold. A hearing test recently revealed that I have a high-frequency hearing loss which I attribute to the high pitch from hair dryers right next to my ears every morning for decades.  I have since been very careful about purchasing lower-frequency dryers, except for this purchase when I let my guard down.  From the second I turned it on to test it, the sound was so high-pitched that I compared the pitch to my existing lower-decibel dryer and the new dryer was significantly higher-pitched. I couldn't return it fast enough."
1,The hair dryer is not good at all sounds weird and smells burnt after 2 time using it and stop working I don’t know what happened hope this don’t happen again
1,This worked great and then it just stopped! No heat coming from it. Very disappointed
1,The heat died already after 30 days and now I cannot return it.
1,It stopped working after one month and smoke was coming out of it.
1,Had this product for about 2 years which is actually a decent lifespan. However today during use it gave off a loud pop and some bright red sparks. Absolutely not worth the safety hazard.
1,"I bought this as a gift for my daughter, when we opened the box and saw how big this thing is, we didn't even try to use it. You would have to have large hands and really long hair to be able to use this.I want to return it but only had 30 days to do so, which was past the date I gave this to her. Amazon's strict 30 day return policy on this in unfair.Am so disappointed!"
1,"Within a month, the dryer completely stopped working."
1,It made sparks and orange sparks around the barrel.  Afraid it will start a fire.  Tried returning to Amazon but return is taking forever
1,I used this product one time.  Could not return because time limit had passed.  After a month my scalp has not healed.  Be careful if you brought this item.
1,Bad bad bad dont buy
1,This product is easy to use and works well BUT my first one over heated after a year and I just replaced it at the end of June. The second one burned out after just two months. I think they may be defective.
1,"I am disgusted. This box looked like it may have been opened when it arrived. I opened it up and saw that it had definitely been used- there was someone else's hair in the bristles of the brush. This is completely unacceptable, unsanitary, and unsafe. Disgusting, Amazon!"
1,I loved this blow dryer but it only lasted 4 months. It no longer blows out hot air. I’m extremely disappointed.
1,"I liked this product initially, but after maybe 10 uses, it burnt out. There’s an awful burning smell & it’s totally unusable. I’m completely disappointed after reading so many great reviews."
1,Dryer died 1 day after return possible date(31 days) used 2 times a week
1,"How can I get a new one, for the number of times I have used this it should not be destroyed by melted prongs. $50 is not cheap so what a disappointment."
1,"Tooooooooo loud….. sounds like a 747 plane on the runway✈️. It’s really quite unfortunate because everything else about it was exactly what I was looking for ergonomically, power, size,  very unfortunate. Maybe this is something they could work on, because it seems I was not the only one that experienced hearing loss well trying to dry their hair🤪"
1,Stopped working immediately after first use.
1,"I liked the dryer the first few times I tried it but by the third time I noticed my hair was VERY frizzy and damaged! The temperature gets extremely not, even with heat protectant it completely damaged my hair. I’ve been using hair masks the past few weeks to try to repair it but I think all I can do it cut off a few inches of length. Super disappointing! I know this product gets high reviews and people love it so if you buy it use caution!"
1,Just a few days after I was outside of the return window. So frustrating.
1,"After very few uses, many of the bristles melted and bent, so they are not affective any moreAlso after a while I started to hear small exploding sounds from the heating body inside, that made me very scared to use it again, as It is so close to my hair, I was afraid it will burn it..."
1,"I've never written an online review before but felt the need to for this product, given that it literally lasted 5 seconds. I plugged it in, immediately smelt a burning scent, and within 5 seconds it shut off, and wouldn't turn back on. Very frustrating. You shouldn't sell products that don't work"
1,I bought it as an early present for my wife.. unfortunately half of the functions don’t work and can’t even return or ask a replacement as the return window is now closed.. so disappointed!!
1,Bad purchase.
1,The high settting stopped working after only a couple of uses
1,"The quality is bad. I couldn’t use it even once i turned it on, fire came out from the hair dryer. I requested for return for more than 3months now but no one came for pick up."
1,"This product did not work at all! The minute we plugged it in and after working for very few seconds a strange noise came out of it and then it stopped working and did not work ever since, It is as if it burned from the inside."
1,"The product worked great. Unfortunately is didn’t even last a year before it died. I have thin hair, so it shouldn’t have burnt out so fast."
1,No
1,"So big and awkward - uncomfortable to use !Heavy , hate it !!!"
1,This was great until it wasn’t. The temperature control was poor- it would get very hot even on the low setting. I only used it a couple of times per week and always on low and the motor died after a few months.
1,"Blow dry brush started sparking and now won’t even heat up, have used it maybe 10 times. Extremely disappointed"
1,"At first, I loved this product and thought it was a game changer. However, I have had two separate hot air brushes from Revlon and both have malfunctioned in different ways. The first one lasted about 6 months before the cord insertion site started deteriorating and it was no longer safe to use. The second only lasted 3 uses before the settings malfunctioned. No matter if I set it on high, low, or cool, it has the same temperature and is stuck in the low mode. Very disappointed in the lack of longevity"
1,"It was obvious I received a used product. The packaging was damaged, torn & taped."
1,The blowing power goes up and down. I’ve checked the plugs (my house is 15 years old) so it’s not the electric. I know people who have the same one and theirs doesn’t do it . Concerned it may catch fire. Using with caution $50 is a lot to toss out.
1,"It stopped working after less than two months. Liked what it did when it worked, but stopped working for no reason."
1,This thing is LOUD and not the best for my shoulder length hair.  I bought the Lange smaller version which is MUCH quieter and perfect for shorter hair.  I hate spending more for essentially the same product.  I wish they made a smaller version.  Also don't make these items so LOUD.
1,It stopped working properly.  No longer heats up..
1,"No control over temperature. Totally destroyed my hair, 1/2 inch strands that were chin length. Hair dresser said a lot of her clients who use the brush/dryer have the same issue."
1,"The dryer got way too hot while using it and burned my hair and my fingers.  It just burned itself up today, too.  I cleaned it regularly, did not use it everyday, and it's barely 9 months old!  Disappointed."
1,"I purchased two of these. The first one I returned because I thought the thermometer was defective, which caused it to overheat. I ordered and received the second one and saw that it was indeed very hot but thought I just needed to learn how to use it. At first, I loved it. So quick and easy and it made my hair feel very soft. I tried waiting until my hair was almost dry before using it and then not touching my hair as I was blowing it dry so I wouldn't feel how hot it was getting. I have highlighted hair. I went to my hair stylist yesterday and she was horrified at the condition of my hair! Broken and split ends everywhere!So my advice, DO NOT USE IF YOU HAVE PROCESSED HAIR!!"
1,So damaging. I bought 3 of these thinking they'd be great for me and my daughters. They do a great job drying your hair but we've all experienced a ton of breakage even on the low setting. I went to return them but just missed the return window. What a shame!
1,LITERALLY HAD IT FOR A MONTH AND JUST SHUT OFF AS I WAS USING IT. WASTE OF MONEYYYYYY I CANT EVEN RETURN IT TO GET A NEW ONE. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE ALSO. DO NOT BUY THIS
1,It didn’t last 30 days! I used it 4 times. Extremely dissatisfied.
1,The bristols melted on the first use! I am so disappointed!.
1,"Purchased in March 2021 died July 29, 2021. Don’t waste your money. I literally used it 3x. Don’t waste your money. Cannot recommend."
1,Does’ t work. Wrong shape !!!!
1,"I bought one for my wife and she hated it. It was sold as a new product, but it came used and full of hair, with the box half open. this is ridiculous and I will return and want my money back. I want a new product."
1,I have medium thick hair tired all settings and all it did was straighten my hairel Everytime. It also burned my hair with using heat protectant.
1,This product broke after only a few months - don't buy it.
1,Product had already been opened and used. There was literally hair in the box. So gross.
1,I was incredibly excited to use this product. It sounded like such a great idea. Blow dry and style all at once. When I first started using it I was so excited at the volume and smoothness it gave me. I started to notice shortly though that some of my hair in the front was shorter than the rest. I have all one length lob and it was strange that the hair was shorter. As time went on I realized that my hair was breaking/burning off as I used this dryer. At first I thought it was breaking so I mostly dried my hair with the conventional hairdryer and then used this to style it but today I realized that it’s getting so hot it’s burning my hair off. I now have many short pieces of hair that stick out at all angles because of this appliance. I am extremely disappointed and it will take forever to grow that hair back out. What a huge bummer!
1,"At first I struggled using it because it is a little heavy. After a few times times, I learned how to hold it the right way. However, after 5-10 uses I started to notice the bristles bent, maybe with the heat or maybe with the use, but this shouldn't happen. In addition, this gave me split ends faster than anything. My ends are fried! I always let my hair air dry a little before using this, so I use it with damp hair, not soaking wet.I do not recommend this, it doesn't live up to the hype, damages the hair and bristles doesn't last long."
1,Terrible
1,"I had such high hopes but I was so disappointed with this hair dryer/curler. After 6 weeks, I smelled smoke and quickly unplugged it. Now it won’t even turn on. Of course, it is. Ego does the return date and there is no one to call. Epic fail Revlon!"
1,"I just got the item early May and as of today, it does not work! I haven’t even used it more than a few times. Waste of money- do not buy!!"
1,Very noisy and heavy
1,The motor was so loud it made the styling experience uncomfortable.  Found a much quieter replacement.
1,Heating element went out after a few weeks.  Not well built at all.
1,"After 5 months of using it’s just stop working ! I can’t believe this, don’t buy"
1,"Used it maybe twice a week if that.... Maybe 3 times a month and it already burned out on me. Bought on May, died in July."
1,Stopped working after few times used.
1,I liked the dryer but it stopped working at 7 months old.  There is no way to even open it to see if wires have become disconnected.
1,Does not dry your hair well at all. Very low power.
1,"I wouldnt recommend this hair dryer, coz I bought it twice through amazon and the first time it just stopped working and amazon was really nice enough to refun me and i gave it another chance and bought it again! and guess what! it stopped working again and it was only one time usage! I donno why revelon is producing such a useless dryer"
1,Too noisy and runs too hot.
1,It worked excellent when I first got it but it’s already dead and it’s only been 3 months. I’m not happy at all at the quality. There was nothing out of there ordinary as far as usage. I would expect it would have lasted at least a year. Very disappointed.
1,"Ordered last October (so it’s less than one year old). Easy to use, low or high heat - both work as expected, but the dryer stopped working today sadly. I could hear the motor as it seized up, and then smelled a faint burning smell (unplugged immediately). Not sure if I received a “lemon” or if others have experienced this issue."
1,The hairdryer I ordered is defected & does not work! it was very disappointing because I was on vacation
1,Broke just past the return date after 3 uses horrible service from Amazon on this product don’t buy it despite the misleading positive reviews.
1,This is not for shoulder length hair and doesn't get the frizz out by the roots. Disappointing!
1,"I loved this product, but it broke after only 4 uses. It still turns on and gets extremely hot but barely blows out air and is very quiet now."
1,"After the 3rd use, it started smelling horribly and smoke came out of it.  I am afraid to use it again.. Unfortunately  it is too late to return it. Would not buy it again."
1,Stopped heating up after two times of use.
1,I got this product and got it shipped from US to Malaysia. It didn't work. Now its a hassle to return. Also  its very loud and terribly hot.
1,I bought it for my wife. She used it for six months and now it's broken. It has a weird noise and gets incrediblly hot. Waste of money.
1,Temperature was so hot that I had trouble holding the section of hair. Also the tip became so hot that couldn’t use it to guide the appliance.
1,I was excited to use this product as soon as it came I opened the Box plugged it in I didn't even switch it on yet it started to overheat as soon as I switched it on it blew up and smoke started coming out of it I immediately called Amazon to refund me the money and allow me to disregard T disregard this Revlon brush heater because I was not able to mail it back and be responsible  For when it is shipped out and something happens in transit like blow up. I didn't even use it that is so sad as soon as I plugged it up it just blew up and smoke came out everywhere. I immediately went and threw it outside because I was scared that it was going to blow up
1,I just used it once and it stopped working
1,Used this product for months and thought it was amazing. I started to notice my layers were uneven and shorter!  I had horrible hair damage and had to have my stylist cut my hair in order to even it out and now it’s on the road to recovery. I used a heat protector every time. I came home from my stylist on threw it away.
1,After two uses it just stopped working !!!  Very disappointed I paid for it!
1,"I loved the idea and how my hair looked, but I have thin hair that I hate to admit, is already slightly damaged.  I used this product a few times and loved the result, but the barrel gets WAY too hot, even on the low setting.  I know that if I use this again, its going to do serious damage to my hair.  I'm surprised it gets such a high rating from everyone."
1,Stopped working one month in.
1,Item stopped working after 4-5 uses only
1,THIS PRODUCT HAS BEEN RECALLED DUE TO FIRE
1,Purchased in October on 2020. The other day my wife was using it and it started smoking really bad! Cause one of my upstairs smoke detectors to go off!!
1,Be Safe!! This item has been recalled and Revlon has not communicated about it nor Amazon. It gets very hot and is a fire risk.
1,Used it once for about 5 minutes and it cut off & would not turn back on. Returned/defective.
1,"I was only able to use it twice because it started to smell burnt, I was drying a friend's hair when it started to smell bad and the whole brush felt so hot, it could have caught fire."
1,Caught on fire 3rd time using it.
1,"Loved this product at first, but after a few uses it started making a popping noise and there were little plastic pieces that broke off on the inside and fell out through the hole!"
1,Didn't like how works. Bought another one before and thought this one was better but was wrong.
1,"Highly defective. Doesn’t turn on properly and once it does, it shuts right off again."
1,"Bought it in January. Used it maybe 10 times. Today it began making a scary noise and cracking pops from the inside. Frightened that fire was coming, I threw it out. So disappointed now sitting here with damp hair."
1,"At first I loved this product. My hair was dry more quickly than ever before and finally I could get a blowout that looks a lot more like the one I get from the salon.I only used it 1-2 times per week for a couple of weeks. Suddenly, my hair that has always been so thick (I had to get it thinned out every 6 weeks so it wasn’t heavy and weighed down) and healthy was breaking and falling out.I was driving my car and when I went to get out at my destination there was hair all over my lap and and shirt. Then it kept falling out on my shirt when I’m sitting, standing, or waking around.I started to panic thinking it may not stop and I would bald for my upcoming birthday celebration and vacation.It finally seemed to slow down and when I lost about half my normal hair volume. Now my hair is so thin. My hair feels dryer, more damaged, and thinner than it ever has in my life. My scalp has also been hurting a little. I haven’t checked, but it feels like it may be burned a little there as well.I have tried being so nice to my hair. I don’t comb it wet, I haven’t used any blow dryers, I’ve had two professional conditioning treatments, I use olaplex leave in conditioner, AND MY HAIR IS STILL SHEDDING! I’m losing hair multiple times a day. I’ve been having panic attacks about how thin it is going to get or if I’ll end up with a bald spot. My hair is about 1/3 the thickness that it used to be. I have a photo shoot in one month and I am hoping and praying I’ll have hair that looks at least okay by then. However, since a growth cycle for hair is 4- 6 months I’m not hopeful.I loved this product the first time I used it and thought it was what I had been looking for, but the hair damage is not worth it!"
1,"After using it a few times, I plugged it in and it immediately caught on fire. I had to place it on the concrete porch outside immediately."
1,I was going to return this product after I used it.  It is difficult to turn it as you try to dry your hair.  I would not recommend this hair dryer.
1,The engine didn’t work well
1,"I thought after reading the reviews and seeing it was on sale, I would try it. Horrible mistake. The problems with this were numerous.1. I do not have frizzy hair. I can count the number of times I've had frizzy hair and it's less than 10. After using this, I had the worst frizzy hair ever. It was sticking up all over my head, to the point I had to rewash my hair in order for it to go down. I used my normal hair dryer afterwards and did not have frizzy hair.2. It gave off a strange static electricity/burning metal smell.3. It would not go to the high heat setting. If I turned it to that, it would make a strange noise, the weird smell would get stronger, and it would shut off. I tried a few times before I gave up and just had it on the low setting.4. Even on the low setting, it would randomly shut off.Honestly, one of the worst products I have ever used. Save your money."
1,It did not help with hair fall.Infact I feel that my hair started falling even more.More than. Month but still hair fall continues.
1,"I have only used this shampoo and conditioner five times. Each time, I had hair loss. I don’t recommend it. It is probably the worst I have ever used."
1,This product messed my scalp up. Hair is greasy less than 24 hours after washing. Dried my hair out and agitated my scalp. Wouldn’t recommend
1,"I thought this would be a life changing product for my dry, damaged hair but this is probably the worst shampoo and conditioner I have ever purchased. I followed the directions on the label and still did not fulfill what was advertised. Every wash made my hair extremely oily, flat, thin, tangled and dry at the ends. It’s not that it just felt oily, you would literally tell my hair was oily just by looking at it and I only used a small quarter size pump of conditioner. Then the following days it would just dry up and make my hair look fried and tangled.  I had so much hope in this product because of the reviews but I’m starting to think they are paid reviews, bots, or they changed their previous ingredients. Don’t waste your time or money on these products!  #sad #Disappointed"
1,Too much hair fall. My daughter and me lost all hair
1,I did not like this product because it left scum on my scalp that I could not wash out. This is not for a daily use.
1,This shampoo makes my hair look dry. I wouldn’t recommend for colored hair.
1,Didn’t work for me. I used it for 2 months and my hair started falling out even more. I already have thinning issues and bald spots and this shampoo made it worst. The only thing I can say is that it did improve the oiliness from my scalp. The scent is great. I really wanted this to work but it only made my hair worst.
1,"I really was hopeful for this product but it is awful for me. Not only did it strip out a lot of my color, but also completed sucked all the moisture from my hair and scalp. I actually got this FOR dry scalp but now it is 10 times worse and my previously soft hair now feels like straw. It made my hair knotty, tangled, and very, very dry, and I followed the instructions 100%."
1,"This was the worst shampoo and conditioner I’ve ever used.  It made my hair sooo unbelievably dry, it felt like straw, and my hair wasn’t dry before I used it.  Just awful. And the smell…I didn’t care for it.  I found it very over powering."
1,I do not like this shampoo. Shampoo make my hair dry and puffy
1,My hair being naturally thin and dry I thought this shampoo and conditioner would help. Nope did the opposite! My hair was falling out in big clumps every time I washed it or brushed it! Don't buy it doesn't help.
1,"This product has way too much packaging and it doesn't work. The shampoo is okay as a shampoo, nothing special, but the conditioner is absolute crap."
1,I threw it in the trash the smell was very bad ...smells of chemicals I don't recommend.
1,"I’m so disappointed with this shampoo and conditioner especially for the price I paid. It makes my hair feel so weighed down and greasy, dead, and dull. Conditioner is supposed to help with brushing through hair and moisturizing hair this conditioner makes it hard to brush through my hair and while blow drying makes my hair super staticky."
1,"The bottle has a teeny tiny cap that’s hard to open. The conditioner bottle is so hard, I can barely squeeze it out. I have to shake it hard. It’s advertised as a “clean” product, but still has a very bad ingredient."
1,The bottles make it very difficult to get the shampoo and conditioner out. My hair was very dry after the shampooing and the conditioner did nothing as far as moisturizing. I could not comb through my hair after the conditioner. My hair is normally a cinch to comb through. No issues what so ever normally. I will return to my normal conditioner and shampoo.
1,"The product made my hair feel so oily, I didn't need the conditioner.  My scalp was itchy, oily, my hair had no volume, and it felt like I loss hair. I got it because I read other people's reviews and the description of the product.  I guess it's different for everyone."
1,"This shampoo and conditioner didn’t work out well to me. I did an opposite result as what it supposed to be doing in the hair. I have followed the instructions but every time I used this product my hair were falling more and more. The conditioner makes my hair feels tougher; it doesn’t feels soft at all! I’m planning to stop using this product.Based on my experienced, I do not recommend this product."
1,The shampoo smell is so bad .
1,This product doesn’t help one bit
1,"My hair loss is extremely significant. The first time I used this shampoo/conditioner I lost quite a bit of hair, but I thought I'd give it more time. The second time the loss was even more. The third, and believe me the LAST time, my hair loss was significant. Also, my hair looks worse than it ever did, frizzy, dry and scraggly. No, I do not color my hair, so this is not a factor. I will go back to my previous shampoo and this one is in the trash."
1,Tried this because of the reviews. I've been having difficulty finding a shampoo that doesn't build up in my hair and thought this would work. It was worse. The first time I used it it looked like I hadn't washed my hair in weeks. It was so hard to wash it all out after that. I tried it again a week later and the same thing. I couldn't wash it out. It took multiple scrubs of other shampoo to wash it out.
1,"Within the first couple of uses, noticeable stripping of hair color.My scalp also had an Odd, earthy smell.If you color treat your hair, I would not recommend using this product."
1,The products leave my hair heavy and almost immediately dirty again If I still had the packaging I would return them
1,Horrible my spouse and I both used it so we have different hair types to see if that would make a difference smells okay but dried out both of our hair very bad brittle straw-like crappy no no control frizzy yet I'll never buy it again.  Worse stuff I have ever used
1,I didn’t no like this product. I flooded the directions but it did not cleans my hair and left it feeling really heavy and just nasty. I don’t recommend this was all hype dont buy
1,"Seemed to dry out my hair more than make it soft (this is week three of using and I followed the directions of letting it soak, etc… )  the smell reminds me of dog shampoo…. and even worse were the two days after, of not washing my hair, it starts to smell funky (like the vinegar that’s in it). I kept thinking it was my gym clothes… nope, my hair. Would not purchase again."
1,Scent is fine but man I lose handfuls of hair at a time using this. I can switch to my normal shampoo and only lose 2 or 3 strands...but with this it leaves me holding a golfball sized ball of hair! It's crazy. So disappointed in this shampoo. Don't waste your money or your hair.
1,Read Up on this product causing hair loss and damage. Threw away. Will never purchase again.
1,"Was excited about trying this product after reading all the great reviews but I am very disappointed with it. I have fine hair and I found that it left my hair feeling greasy and flat, gave it no body. Would not recommend for fine type hair."
1,I have been using this for about 4 days and my hair feels like hay. I cannot even comb my hair. Very disappointed!
1,I have stubborn dandruff since I'm using this I have more dandruff dry scalp stop using it yesterday I use for 3 weeks didn't work for me.
1,Do not buy. I tried using for about 2 months but it's causing major hair loss
1,This product smells awful. My hair still felt dirty and greasy. It's just not for me and my family. Won't be buying again. Sorry.
1,"Did not like it my hair felt greasy, tried several times always the same greasy feeling"
1,do not buy it... no effects and no foams when using it...
1,Terrible! Wouldn't come out of my hair. Left my hair looking greasy! Not happy with this product at all.
1,Super unhappy with the way my hair felt.  Had to fight with the brush to get it through my hair.
1,"Followed directions. Hair all tangled after shampooing. I did brush hair prior. After using conditioner ,still tangled, breaking hair to try to pull wide tooth comb through!  What a mess. Used it 5 more times always the same result. I’m through with this product"
1,"This stripped the red color out of my hair in one use.  Warning, this shampoo should not be used on dyed hair."
1,"The shampoo pump did not work and was broken. They were attached to the bottles  when I opened the shipment. It smelled different than the shampoo of the same brand that I bought directly from the company previously. No seal. My only option was to return for a refund, which I cannot do since it leaked all over and was too messy to go about doing. Best to avoid - buy directly from the manufacturer website - I remember they came in a box and had a seal and the pumps were not attached in shipping! Now I know why. I am throwing them out to play it safe!"
1,I didn’t like the product it left my hair full and heavy didn’t feel clean and lost its luster
1,"I had the same experience each time I tried this product and I used it several times. It left my hair feeling dirty with a residue. It weighed down my hair and made it look dirty, as if I hadn't washed it in a week. I had no adverse reactions, but this product did not work at all for me. I gave it several tries thinking that maybe my hair needed product detox, but I had the same result each time. My hair felt coarse and almost sticky. There is nothing good I can say about this. I would not purchase it again."
1,This shampoo made my hair feel stiff and the conditioner did not make my hair soft I had to use another conditioner I had to soften my hair. What a waste of money
1,"I’ve never written a review before but I am so upset I thought I’d make this product my first .. in just a few days Of use my hair started falling out, amazon should not be selling this corrosive  product to anyone!"
1,Made my hair greasy and the buildup was horrible! Would not recommend.
1,Bought it for my wife. She started to lose hair after two three days. Now she is continuously losing hair everyday. Faded her hair color as well. She had to stop using it to reduce hair lose. Worst shampoo ever we got. Now regretting after buying this.
1,Did not moisture nor did it make my hair soft. It just left my hair feeling nasty
1,I received this product with it already expired. How disappointed. Will never buy this product again.
1,I personally do NOT recommend this product. I used it for a couple of weeks and my hair started to break. My hair stylist even commented on how brittle my hair had become using it for those couple of weeks. I have now been using something else for about 2 weeks and my hair still hasn't fully recovered.
1,"This product ruined my hair. Completely striped my hair out. It’s dry and brittle, and it wasn’t before I used this. My hair is now in bad shape. Do not use this product if you want soft shiny hair.Unfortunately I didn’t make the connection immediately. On the third shampoo, my hair was so bad.I’m not sure how to fix this mess."
1,"It made my hair so rough and so hard especially the conditioner and I have ordered 2 sets, other one for my kids which has the same effects on their  hair.. Waste of my money. Too expensive for the quality it has.."
1,Unfortunately this product didn't work for me. My hair felt dirty and sticky when washing it and after using it when it was dry it was static prone.
1,It left my hair horrible greasy. It was very hard to remove from hair. My hair ended up looking like I had some styling gel on the top.
1,Disappointed
1,"Leaves my hair frizzy and knotted, I was very positive when I decided to give it a try, based on all the comments I've read, now I will not pay 1 dollar for this product, the conditioner has a consistency as condensed milk, not rich at all. Shampoo has a  lightly smell of vinegar, but not doing anything except to make you look like a brush after drying your hair, DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
1,Do not like this product…left my hair feeling greasy and flat. I tried several times and still the same problem trying to find someone else to give to that likes it just jot for me!!!
1,"This is crap!!! I used it on my hair, once. Never ever again. It was so matted and knotty, I could not get a comb or brush through it, after I showered. Do not buy!"
1,"I tried this product according to directions and had horrible results. Reached out to the company and they offered me a 50% refund and encouraged me to keep trying it. Left my hair knotty and straw-like every use, brushing out my hair also seemed like I was losing more hair than with other shampoos/conditioners."
1,"I’m finally writing a review after about a month of using this shampoo, I was very excited when I first got this product because of all the positive reviews! But sadly this did not work for me, it did quite the opposite of what it was supposed to do. My hair felt greasy, had no volume. I also had an itchy scalp and dandruff. At first I thought I wasn’t washing out the product right but even after trying to wash it more I still had the same outcome! I really did try to give this product a try but it just didn’t work for me."
1,"The shampoo was literally water in the the bottle, a shame, a total waste of money, very disappointed. If it was a 5$ I would even say anything.  smells like water, looks and feels like water. aweful"
1,Horrible
1,"This stuff was awful! The first time I used it, my hair felt as if i didnt just wash it. It was grimy and felt dirty. Do not waste your money. Not worth it."
1,"This is the worst smelling shampoo, and it intensified my flaky scalp! So disappointing."
1,"If possible want to give negative 5 stars. Hair became more fizzy and hair fall just multiplied so many times.Caused rashes and itchy scalp. Either the vendor selling adulterated products or product itself worse quality. Save your money, time hair and health."
1,The only thing nice is the smell. By hair tangles with the shampoo and the conditioner does nothing but weigh my hair down. Very disappointed and still trying to understand all the hype. Very disappointed. Complete waste of money.
1,"DO NOT BUY- this product makes hair fall so bad and causes dry scalp. If you are looking to lose hair fast and get bald spots, this is the product for you!"
1,"This shampoo and conditioner are very thick and so hard to get out of your hair. I have long hair and it's terrible. My hair looks greasy. My husband, who hardly has any hair, even had trouble getting all of the shampoo out."
1,I had issues with this product it broke off my hair in areas due to the apple cider vinegar which strips hairs
1,I lost hair. It didn’t work.
1,Do not recommend! Dried out my hair so bad and the shampoo felt like it left a film on my hair.
1,Damaged and dried out my hair!! Dont use!!!!!
1,"Wasn't impressed at all, very disappointed. I was hoping it would help my frizz and it did nothing."
1,Horrible product! Ill never buy this again!! Heck I only used it a couple times and then I threw it away!
1,"Made my hair fall out, dry and dull looking. My hair looks better when I use store brand stuff. Very disappointed. Definitely DO NOT recommend it!"
1,Not a good product was really disappointed
1,"Don't do it! It says its sooo good for your hair but it was horrible. Stripped all the oil out of my hair, my hair felt like straw for days. Don't. Just dont."
1,Did not feel like it even washed my hair when used
1,"The smell is unlikely, the moisturizer feels like lard in my hair, my hair became heavy and weighted down even after i blow dry my hair. The product is mediocre. I want to return it but i trashed the box. Waste of money."
1,"Doesn’t work. Save your money. I used both shampoo and conditioner for over a month, I didn’t see a difference."
1,This product did not do what it claims to do regarding making Grey hair more silver. The conditioner is NOT moisturizing at all. I am not happy with that purchase!
1,"This product was on the best sellers list on the today’s show. Idk how... it’s terrible! Probably the worst Shampoo and conditioner I’ve ever tried. My hair doesn’t feel clean after  using the shampoo and the conditioner is so watery and useless, my hair feels worst after. It smells ok. That’s the best thing I can say about it."
1,Doesn’t worth the money and my hair get frizzy more
1,I did not like this product. After using another salon brand this did not compare at all and the cost is similar for the shampoo. My daughter uses ACV shampoo due to a condition with her scalp this stuff didn't help at all.
1,"it was used to be awesome before ( 3 years ago ) but I decided to buy it and use it again OMG it is horrible, makes my hair very dry and not comb able🙃 .very bad both shampoo and conditioner"
1,The worst shampoo I have ever used. I don’t think this is made for thick or coarse hair. My hair was matted and dried out after the shampoo and the conditioner does nothing. I had hand fulls of hair coming out of my scalp.
1,I don’t like because make bad my hair
1,I have a really hard time combining my hair.
1,"This is the WORST shampoo I have ever used! I was so disappointed, because it had great reviews. I have color-treated curly hair. The shampoo made my hair feel dry and brittle immediately after rinsing it out. I followed the instructions to the T. The conditioner was no help. I air-dry my hair. Once it was dry, it was frizzy, dry, and felt like it was going to break off if I touched it too much. I waited a week to wash my hair again...same results. In between washes I conditioned only. Did not help. Don't waste your money!"
1,My hair is dry and falling out.
1,This product didn't do anything it say my hair feel damaged and looks awful
1,This is the worst shampoo/conditioner I have ever put on my hair. Horrible!!! Not worth the money!!!
1,"I tried using much longer than I really wanted to, hoping it would do what they say. But, it’s horrible! It does not leave your hair feeling clean at all!  My hair is long, and fine but I have a lot of it. Use bed head urban antidotes, it works so much better and follow up with biolage leave in conditioner. My husband who has a dry scalp and oily but very fine hair even tried it and he hated it! It left it sticky, does not feel clean at all."
1,Waste of money
1,I could not figure out after using this what was really making my hair dry & breaking? I thought it was hair spray so I went  two days without hair spray and it ended up being this Shampoo & Conditioner. I followed the instructions to the T waiting the correct time to leave on the shampoo and conditioner and my hair was AWFUL. I used it 8 times until finally figuring out that this  product was the problem.
1,"I really can’t see how this product has such good reviews. I wasn’t expecting a miracle product, but I definitely didn’t expect shampoo that would make my hair become impossible tangled and require 20-30 minutes to brush after every shower. I feel like I’m losing even more hair than before because of the tangles. I thought perhaps the conditioner would help, but that was also useless.My scalp has also become itchy and sensitive, which has never even been an issue for me.This product must work differently depending on your type of hair because this stuff just caused me to have a stressful shower experience and develop a tender scalp. Will try to return for a refund."
1,After reading all the reviews I went ahead and purchased it. Been using it for about a week now and I am miserable everytime. My hair is greasy and hard to run my fingers through. Definitely not for me. Wish I can get a refund because $30 for shampoo and conditioner that you don’t like is pricy!
1,Did not like the conditioner.
1,"I've used a million different shampoos over the years (naturally strawberry bond, almost to my butt length hair) this may be the most terrible product I've ever used. I don't color my hair and maybe use heat on it 4 times a year. I've used this product every other day for about 2 weeks now and I'm not sure my hair ever felt so dry, it actually sounds crunchy if I scrunch it in my hand. Buyer beware!"
1,Gave me a terrible scalp itchiness and dryness. My scalp even bled from so much dryness and itch.
1,"I don't usually leave reviews. I am very disappointed in this product. I saw good reviews for this shampoo and wanted to try it. It was more expensive than I usually spend for shampoo and conditioner. I decided to treat myself. I was so excited when it came. I used it right away. I have been using it for 2 weeks. (Some said to give it some time). But, it just makes my hair very oily. I don't usually have oily hair. I also read later on a different product's review that the person writing the review had changed from WOW after years because the formula seemed to have changed and did the same to her hair. I will not buy this again! Very disappointed and sad to have wasted my money."
1,Didn’t care much for it
1,"So I've  ordered this before and absolutely  loved It, added moisture  and cleared up my dandruff. Unfortunately this time around It appears I got a bad batch or something. It smelled differently, then after using It, I was left with a weird sticky greasy texture In my hair. I tried to rinse It out but to no avail, I actually  had to rewash my hair with a different  shampoo.  So I'll  have to toss this  out as its unusable."
1,"I have used these products for 2 year and absolutely no difference in growth , softness, or regrowth still have breakage worst than before, and dull unmanagable hair leftnitbworst than it was before"
1,"Did not like this, makes your hair feel dirty"
1,"Didn’t work for me makes my hair crunchy and really dry,I’m really disappointed."
1,Did not care for the product.
1,I wanted to like this but this shampoo was awful. The conditioner wasn’t good either. The smell was ok but it left my hair really damaged feeling- like straw and my hair is usually shiny and pretty. It was disappointing and really hard to brush after
1,I just want to say worst product that I used to wash my hair. The shampoo doesn't clean oily hair well at all. The conditioner doesn’t soften your hair it makes it rough feeling. The product was so bad in my hair I have a few small spot on my head that is missing hair that came out in clumps. This is only after four days of using. DO NOT waste your money.
1,Did not help my hair at all... not growth.. no thickness and my hair was still tangled after shampoo snd conditioning... did not make my scalp feel clean... not worth the money
1,I have greasy hair and this instead of helping it just leaves my entire hair feeling greasy instead of just my problem area it’s not for me been using it for 3 weeks both me and my man don’t like the way our hair feels
1,"I used it to moisturize hair, but it is too messy and can only be used on scalp.  Which I could return it."
1,Didn't do anything but make my straight fragil hair worse
1,"I would not buy it again. There Customer Service is lousy, basically none  existing. I had a small question,, called themthree times and none of my calls were returned.I would not buy this product again and would not recommend itI will not give them 1 star !!!!!!"
1,Did not like period! Not what it says it does.
1,Didn’t notice any difference after use. Still hair loss
1,No good for me
1,"do not expect a miracle, it does not merge"
1,I can’t speak for what may actually be in here though it was well packaged and appears to be castor oil. Only for the girls with the hair loss and poor quality hair who prayed that this would fix it. It won’t. If you’re like me it will also lead to horrific acne and cysts even on your scalp even once you’ve washed several times. I’m really disappointed honestly.
1,The oil is very thick and hard to apply on the scalp without damaging the hair. Lot of hair loss during and after applying the oil. I would not recommend this product. I would rate this product 0 if I had the option.
1,"I’ve used this product three times since I got it.The first time went fine.The second time I noticed excess hair coming out today when I washed it, but attributed it to tangled hair.The third time my hair came out by the fistful.I have fine thin hair. Avoid."
1,It is useless
1,"After watching viral videos of people using this religiously, I bought it and did the same.. months later I've had more hair loss than anything. It did nothing other than make my hair greasy."
1,This did not work as intended. Im actually worried it caused Permanent damage. It seem to have made my hair dry as a bone I’m probably gonna have to have a lot of length cut off after wasting a year of growth.
1,"It is very sticky and difficult to apply compared to other oil, even after heating and mixing with other oil. Doesn't spread easily and doesn't get off easily with shampoo. Only used twice, do not know what to do with what's left in such big bottle ."
1,I received my bottle open and mostly empty .. so disappointing
1,"I put a palm size all over my hair and in 3 hrs I started feeling dizzy,nauseas,diarrhea, and I was throwing up for almost 3 hrs. Horrible experience ever!!!!!! Be careful with the things you use might have a bad reaction to it."
1,"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!! Broke me out like crazy, itching scalp and a swollen eye🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️"
1,"Seems like a regular oil,  it’s not like the real castor oil. No seem whatsoever and Castro oil has a smell ."
1,It’s balding my scalp and I don’t notice any growth or development of my hair after using this product for 3 weeks.Just a waste of money :((
1,It’s not an effective castor oil product
1,This stuff is the worst
1,Extremely thick and sticky. Not sure how difficult it will be to get off my scalp :(
1,I didn’t like it
1,Don’t buy this product after using it my wife hair been falling like crazy
1,I got this product to moisturize my scalpel and prevent hair loss...ive used castor oil before but not this product...last time it worked.This particular product literally makes soooo much hair fall out . Like a scary amount...now I have a huge bottle of junk I can't use...and a massive amount of hair falling out just by touching it :(
1,"I bought it and started using it every other day. I used to microwave it before applying as it is so thick and difficult to spread. my scalp was feeling irritated, but I ignored it and kept on using for almost 40 days and then realized that my hair line is receding. I guess I was allergic to it or something, cause I am lost hair on the exact spots I applied the oil on!!! my advice is to use it on a small spot first and if your scalp is itchy, red or irritated stop using as soon as possible."
1,Very thick it stinks and it is not a girl black people hair unfortunately I use this product for over six months wasted my money and saw no results
1,"THE WORST EVER! I HATE HATE HATE THIS PRODUCT. ITS too thick, mats the hair and it has no smell. Its definitely not for hair at all. I would NOT recommend this product at all! Better off getting black Jamaican Castro oil from the store"
1,hard to use
1,Made my scalp tingly and did not notice anything after using the product. Oil is hard to get off your hands.
1,Unfortunately this product didn’t work for me. It left my scalp very dry and itchy.
1,"this smells so so bad and has done absolutely nothing for me. the bottle leaks like crazy and it is so hard to clean once it gets everywhere. i don’t reccomend buying this product at all, find another brand"
1,I received this product damaged the cap was loose so I cleaned it off and read the directions.. it says that you can’t use this as an everyday leave in oil for hair. You have to wash this stuff out. Very misleading advertisement the directions state that you either can leave on over night and rinse or leave on for one hour and rinse out. Very disappointed. Plus the product is so damaged I don’t trust using it anyway.
1,No 1
1,I have no idea who’s writing these reviews. I’ve been consistently using this overnight twice a week sometimes three and have seen no change at all.
1,"My review is really based upon inconvenience as opposed to effectiveness. My hair is really fine and seems pretty thin after a thyroid issue years ago. I’m always looking for ways to make it thicker. This potentially works but it is not worth it! It seems to be a quality product without a strong scent so that is good. However to put it in my hair and leave on for an hour is super inconvenient. It’s so thick and my hair is just a greaseball... I can’t do anything. I found that I couldn’t do it more than once a week and even that felt frustrating. Also I had to wash my hair a few times to get it all out which seemed to result in a bunch of hair coming out. I’m not saying it made my hair fall out, but having to wash it a ton isn’t very gentle on my hair either. I threw it out."
1,"This oil is too sticky. It does not apply easily, and it is very hard to clean. I applied once and threw the rest out. I don't recommend it at all."
1,"I lost A LOT of hair when I used it the first time!  Then I thought maybe I didn't add other oil with it to make it less thicker and cause more hair loss?  So I tried this castor oil again with mixing with jojoba and tea tree oil.  Just after using for less than 3 weeks, I noticed losing a lot MORE hair than normal !!  I didn't really have hair loss problem for a long time until using this product again!  Even after I stopped using this castor oil for about a week, I still keep having a lot of hair loss in the past week!  Don't buy this castor oil as it contains CHEMICALS too from my reading another reviewer's comments and photos of her comparing the before or now product's ingredients!!  Thanks to that reviewer, I will treat this bottle of oil as trash now!!"
1,I don’t like it it’s not castor oil
1,"I had a bowl worth of hairfall after using this product! This oil nearly destroyed my hair. I'm so disappointed in this, especially after reading all the positive reviews. This product is NOT FOR THIN HAIR."
1,"so so so so bad use for a  hair. When I used it for my hair, it didn't moisturizing. And a second day, my hair was very oil. Ok, first time to use, probably I used a worry way. So, I tried many times, it same result. So, this oil is not for a hair."
1,Upon receiving my second bottle I oddly developed an eye infection which had to be treated by my opthmalogist. Took a break from using product. Not thinking it was this product I used it again. Very next morning woke up both eyes infected again.
1,It is hard to spread because of how thick it is. not worth the money
1,This product is not good and not what I expected. I’ve seen no difference which may be because i only used it a couple times. It is so thick and viscous that it hurts when applied to hair/scalp.
1,THICK AND HARD TO SPREAD DONT LIKE THE SMELL
1,I don't like it. Cause it's too thick to smear.
1,No evidence if USDA certification. Could not find them on the USDA database. Not sure what I'm using on my face. Going to through it out.
1,It was a few days late for delivery but when i recieved it. The bottle was broken and spilled im the box. A complete waste of money. I was omly able to use half the bottle and when I did had to add essential oil to hide the smell. I gave it a chance and tried using it for a month and didnt notice any difference. I can find the same product at the store for half the price.
1,"Somehow this came up as organic, cold pressed and unrefined. Its definitely refined. The castor oil is clear and has no scent. Castor oil is naturally scented and has a yellowish color (also cloudy). I have no idea what this is and no way can I tell of its castor oil or not....Highly disappointed"
1,This product is too thick. It does not spread well at all. It’s nothing but a clump of a thick substance in your hand. I absolutely hate it. I want to return it not sure f they will take it back since it’s been opened.
1,I never really like using castor oil in my hair and that’s what I bought this for thinking that cold pressed was his purest form and it would be better for my hair. If you can use castor oil with no problem then this is a good product but it just wasn’t good for me. A waste of money my money
1,"I have a hypothyroid and it caused me to lose some hair. My hair is pretty thin now. I bought this product to hopefully grow my hair but all it did was give me INSANE head acne. I also think it caused a lot of breakage in my hair because since using it only twice, I have horrible breakage at the top of my scalp.The oil is extremely thick and isn’t easily spreadable, it wasn’t moisturizing, and it tangled up my hair when I tried to spread it. I definitely no not recommend."
1,"Didn’t work for me. Maybe because they’ve changed the ingredients or something. But this made my hair fall out terribly on the first day.I washed it off and gave it some days to see if it was actually because of the oil. In those days, my hair never broke when I washed or combed it.Then I gave it another shot. By the time I’d worked the oil through, half the hair on my head was in my hands. It was vert scary to be honest.I bought it because of the good reviews, but this didn’t work for me at all."
1,I hate this - its a sticky mess
1,I received this product today in my mailbox. The top was broken off when I opened package and some of it was spilled inside package.
1,I'm not a super picky liquid eyeliner person but as I used it literally ran so bad it got in my eye and forget about trying to get a good line.
1,When I received my package and wanted too use it it was dry af not worth it
1,"I wore it yesterday for the first time hoping it would last the six hours. Nope, it didn’t even last the first hour. Very disappointing."
1,This didn’t even last 30 minutes. It instantly smudges and smears all day long and gets on both eyelids without even being exposed to sweat or water. It’s just a bad product. I do not recommend at all!
1,I bought this eye liner a few times on here and for some reason the last two have started to leak. It leaves streaks on eyes when applying and if you press too hard a lot of liquid comes out and has gotten in my eye and all over my sink!
1,Immediately wipes off with water.  I'm not sure if this is a fake product or if the one off the shelf would do the same.
1,"The quality is not good, leakage is too serious!"
1,I'm 69 years old and I SWEAT a lot. This isn't water or sweat resistance. Big waste of money
1,"This was so runny it would seep out and drip into my eye. At one point a big drop came out, then ran down into my eye and turned the entire inside of my eye black. It burned like hell. Also, the brush part gets all splayed and messed up no matter how careful I am putting it back in the lid. I have tried a lot of eyeliners and wanted this because it's cruelty free but unfortunately it just won't cut it. Also, it isn't waterproof at all and it smears quite easily. I got one for my daughter and hers has the same problems so it isn't just my one little container."
1,"Liquid gets dry after one use , for 2nd use it’s very hard find liquid inside the bottle"
1,"It says water resistance, smudge proof … BS. So upset with ordering this product. I don’t know how it got such good ratings. It smudged and gave me panda eyes."
1,The bleed is TERRIBLE. It is not precision liner
1,"By no means waterproof, had it on for an hour and looked in the mirror and it was gone...I wasn't even in water. You breathe and this stuff comes off."
1,"The eyeliner is very watery. If you have oily skin, this will not stay on for long. Waste of money."
1,"This eyeliner does not seem to be waterproof. I had smudges under my eyes throughout the day.  By the end of the day, it did not look like I had any eyeliner on!"
1,Goes on smooth and clean but 100% NOT waterproof . Like at all. Not even close.
1,The worst eyeliner ever
1,Fake. Don’t waste your money.
1,Not a fan of this liner. Does not stay on very long.
1,This came with felt tip feathered and bent second replacement began to feather and bend bristles. It’s flakey and opaque it sucked
1,"I live in the south, so we have high humidity and high heat. I would not feel comfortable wearing this outside. It was messy, did not apply like it showed in the pictures and an overall bad buy. I wish I had read the ""real"" reviews prior to purchasing. Save your $$$!"
1,It sucks.  It broke right a way
1,"Had to throw out, really toxic formula and no real long-term staying power."
1,Bad quality dry hard
1,It smudges like crazy... I don’t understand how such a horrible product ends up having so good reviews. Don’t believe the review and avoid the waste of your money!!!
1,I think I was sent a used eyeliner. It was already empty when I tried to use it.
1,"I only have seasonal allergies, so I was stunned when I had an allergic reaction to this eyeliner."
1,Very bad product! It dried so fast and it spilled all over
1,"The fluid pools out from the base of the tip, so most of the product gets wasted. It also bleeds once applied. Very disappointing; I had high hopes for this one."
1,"Smudged off after an hour of wear, left a weird outline. Lack of pigmentation. Never buying again."
1,"Very disappointed! It's the 2nd time I bought this brand, first time was fine. Since I only use it 5 days a week, each pen could last me approx. 3 weeks. So I bought 5 pieces for the 2nd order. This time, 4 out of 5 eyeliner pens only lasted approximately 7-9 days. The quality has declined so significantly that I felt urge to share this poor experience."
1,Applies very messy and ink bleeds making it thick .
1,The color is nothing like what is shown in the picture. It is an extremely light brown that is almost imperceptible even with multiple layers. It also comes off with water and doesn't last more than an hour on oily lids.
1,I tried to get the outside of a cat's eye finished and it leaked and turned my woke eye black! Sucked!! Took 20minutes or more to blink out. Pitched it immediately.
1,NOT SMUDGE-PROOF unfortunately. Very disappointed in this product.
1,Very disappointing purchase. The ratings that I saw prior to purchasing this product were all wrong. This product is messy and nothing like the pictures.
1,"This liner stays on from the morning to late at night. No bleeding, smudging or flaking."
1,"Not at all waterproof. Is not smudge proof. Does not last at all. It makes a nice crisp line, but it’s short lived. Do not recommend."
1,IT SAID 2 COUNT AND I GOT ONE STOP SCAMMING PEOPLE
1,Keeps on smudging :(
1,Dried out!  New from the package and I couldn’t even line half 1/2 of my eye before it acted like it was empty and dried out. Waste of your time and money.
1,"IT WOULD NOT DAMPEN THE TIP.... THEN AFTER OPENING AND SQUEEZING INTERNAL PARTS WITH A PLIERS,IT WORKED.  HOWEVER PUT IT ON AND SMUDGED ALL OVER THE PLACE!  WORST PRODUCT EVER!"
1,Just opened it and it was almost completely dry. Tried shaking it and still nothing. Not useable. Returned.
1,After two weeks use product started leaking from the top and I was no longer able to use it. Had to throw it away
1,I LOVE most NYX products I buy but this just didn’t do it for me. It ran and I had to keep wiping it from under my eye. So disappointed.
1,"After reading the reviews I thought I might have found something that would actually stay on my eyes. I was terribly disappointed as within 2 hours it was smeared under my eyes and above my eyelids. Would I recommend this or buy it again, definitely not."
1,I’m always looking for something that won’t end up on my eyelid - this smudges all over. I wouldn’t recommend it.
1,"I was excited about this liner, but I guess I got a lemon.The fibers got bent in their own cap (I'm INCREDIBLY careful with my makeup, I can't afford to buy much to begin with) and I started finding oozed product on the inside of the cap and along the base of the applicator. I would clean up the mess and try to use the liner, but it was watery and spidered out like CRAZY! I was trying to just line my upper lash line and it ran INTO my eye in the inner corner, and I didn't even come CLOSE to drawing there. I was doing a live tutorial and it completely destroyed my makeup.Hilariously, I guess it's dried out since the last time I used it, it's no longer running quite so badly. But I lost a LOT of product to this mess. I probably should have returned it, but I needed a black liner badly enough for my tutorials that I just dealt with it and wiped up the really obvious spider lines.I will NEVER buy another one."
1,"This dried out so quickly for me, I only got it a few months ago, and started using it around 3 months ago and it completely dried up so fast. I am really, really disappointed with this."
1,This is NOT smudge proof! After half a day of wearing this I look like a raccoon with black smudges under my eyes! And the sad thing is I do t even apply it to the bottom!
1,Junk. Hard to use. Smears. If you can manage to get it look half decent it melts off
1,"I really wanted to love this eyeliner... But sadly I was very disappointed. It has zero longevity. Do not even think about crying or going out in inclement weather with your face exposed. About 2 hours into my very laid-back shift at work, it had completely worn off."
1,"The applicator is awful, the formula is weird and transparent so you have to apply multiple layers and it ends up flaking off. Crusty and awful like eyeliner that's been left without a cap on for days. Don't recommend."
1,"I am a huge fan of NYX products. But this eyeliner caused me a bad eye allergy. I was having NYX liquid eyeliner which I love the most. So, I opened this one only after a month of purchase. My eyes were puffy after few hours of wearing it. Unfortunately my return window is closed. So it is a total waste of money. Never recommend this product."
1,The product came without the seal. I went to Walmart and got it for $1 more with a seal on both ends. This is the fourth product in a package of 6 to come with no seal or a broken one.
1,Not a fan of this product
1,"Messy, don't buy"
1,This stuff sucks! I bought two and after one use they’re severely frayed I can’t even use them anymore save your money and buy something else
1,I’ve had the product less than 3 months. It arrived with 2-4 strands frayed back on the brush applicator. Wasn’t worth returning I just opted to position it differently upon application to avoid the frayed sides touching my eyelid. This morning I went to use it and suddenly it was watery the nice dark ink was now just black water. I thought I was crazy wondering if I had done something wrong but the item was sitting in my makeup tray not covered in water or submerged it literally made no sense. I tried taking a wash clothe to it to try and bolt out the issue but to no avail so I just threw it away.
1,"The fibers starting kinking up and making a mess when I attempted to put the eyeliner on. Within a month of using it, it dried up. It was useless."
1,"Bleeds everywhere. Kept upright to avoid a mess once I apply, still poured liquid everywhere."
1,"I won't ever buy this again. Sure it works well, but the cap just comes off whenever.. happened 3 times and now it's just dried and ruined. Unless my make up bag is kickboxing, it's just a poor lid design."
1,"I didn't care for it. It is not smudge proof, water resistant, or long wearing. It's tough to apply. Not worth yanking at my eye every morning."
1,I have no idea why this thing has so much positive reviews it's awful from the very beginning it's so flaky and the application is bot consistent if u want to waste ur money be my guest
1,No ink. Have to dip pen point in mascara.
1,"Product cracks, won't keep a solid line."
1,"It looks great when I put it on, but then as the morning goes on I begin to notice by around noon, that my eye liner is smudged and then gone. Very disappointing."
1,As soon as my eye teared up all of the eyeliner was gone so I didn’t even get a chance to see how long it lasted because it was only on my face for maybe a half hour with allergies season this is a terrible eyeliner I have had non-waterproof eyeliners that have lasted longer than this one
1,TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!!This product is neither water nor sewat proof.Smudges CONSTANTLY.Tip could be more precise.
1,"I was highly disappointed with this product. Reasons?1) Cap is malfunctioning. I’ve only used this a few times and the cap cannot securely stay in place. The first time it just “popped” off, I thought I just didn’t secure it tightly. It kept popping off every time, no matter how many times and how hard I try to hammer it on. It ended up popping off in my purse and leaking the ink everywhere... I shouldn’t have even put it in my purse with the first sign of cap malfunction. Eventually, it popped off without me checking and dried up completely within a few hours.2) Leaks when you apply it on. I have Kat Von D and Urban Decay’s eyeliner and they don’t “leak” when you apply them on your skin. The pigmentation of this brand is darker, which was why I bought it. Not worth it though with it leaking everywhere.3) Why is it bubbling... there were a few times I tried applying it and I noticed the ink was “bubbling” from the tip... I don’t know if that’s a design flaw with the applicator or if it’s the ink itself... what is in this thing... the last thing I want to do with bubbling liquid is put in near my eyeballs.I’ve heard friends recommend NYX because it isn’t overpriced and works well, but after this purchase, I became so disappointed in this overhyped brand.However, I went back to reviews after all these issues I was having to see what other customers said. I’m now reading about it being a fake... something about the design looking subtly different so you can’t tell the difference. However, the real thing has a felt tip not a brush. I wouldn’t know because this is my first time trying NYX, but now I’m skeptical. Another difference is the real thing is made in France and the fake one (the one I purchased) says made in China.Not sure if this product is just fake and NYX is actually being framed, NYX actually sucks, or NYX’s quality just went down. Maybe I just got the faulty one out of the batch. Who knows? I’m sticking with Kat Von D/Urban Decay."
1,Drys out very quickly not worth it
1,If you’re buying this because it’s “waterproof” don’t. It smudges and comes off as soon as water hits it. These 5 star reviews must have been paid because I was very disappointed :(
1,My eyeliner smudged melted disappeared. Waste of money.
1,Very disappointed. The tip frayed after one week.
1,I bought it used it one time and it literally died on me. Like the pen stopped working and the eyeliner wouldn’t come out. Definitely buying again.
1,The ink bled out and smeared everywhere. I hated it.
1,"I was looking for a replacement for Stila's All Day Liquid Eyeliner that I've been using for years, but this wasn't it. I have puffy eyes, and a couple hours after application, I had MASSIVE smudges under my bottom lid even though I only apply to my top lid. It was awful. It's weird because it stayed in place and the liner didn't look smudged on the top lid, it just left major smudging under my eyes. The applicator is decent and the color is awesome and intense, but the weird carryover smudge marks killed it."
1,False advertising I'm not sure why this is being hyped up so much this is the 3rd one I have gotten and it's all the same smudges it is not waterproof and the brush is not at a fine point dont waste your time
1,"Does not last , definitely not water proof."
1,I accidentally clipped the cap back on at a slight angle for one moment and now the brush tip is ruined. This is the first/only eyeliner this has ever happened to me with. Product is still full but completely unusable.
1,Really disappointed in this product. Brand new and it came out with some of the brush hairs sticking way out. Makes it difficult to maneuver with
1,"Does not last long. Smudges , terrible !"
1,The cap is way too difficult to take off and the tip got ruined on my 5th time using it. Would not recommend.
1,This worked well for a week or two and then leaked all over
1,The compact arrived cracked and broken.  Had to return.  :-(
1,Returned it because it was broken
1,I was so excited for this and it came in broken to pieces :(
1,Smell good but it was broken
1,"This arrived crumbled and useless. Bronzer was everywhere, including out of the compact and all over the box. It was thrown immediately in the trash. Waste of money."
1,No
1,Perfume leaked all over the other products in the bag so it’s all unusable and unable to get a replacement or return item. Waste of money!!
1,Case didn't stay closed and the powder broke apart and crumbled right away. Poor product.
1,"Terrible. They changed the formula and now it doesn’t “stick” to your face. It rubs off with the brush, it rubs off with a makeup blender, it rubs off if you touch it. Terrible"
1,Unpleasant smell
1,Disgusting smell--I should have guessed by the name!
1,Received package and noticed that the perfume had leaked and evaporated inside. I was not able to return item.
1,Received my package and it’s all cracked the bronzer is completely all dust from being cracked in to several pieces very disappointing as I was looking forward to using this product
1,it arrived broken
1,the scent is beyond over powerful and doesn't work the greatest.
1,"Smells disgusting and when I opened the body butter, it was expired and stale. DO NOT BUY THiS PRODUCT 🤮 and you can’t return it either"
1,I previously used younique beachfront bronzer my face has broken out so bad after trying this bronzer
1,"This item arrived completely damaged - shattered into pieces! There was bronzer everywhere on the inside AND outside of the package. It made a mess and I didn't want to use it on my skin (not sanitary, given that it had been opened!) Do not recommend."
1,Product busted in package. Total mess in packaging!
1,Unfortunately this was too sheer to even see on me. I’m med/tan.
1,This may be a decent product if you can get past the terrible perfume scent. I can’t.
1,I was surprised by how strong the scent is. To me very unnecessary. Also I thought physicians formula would be good for sensitive skin but NO. I broke out in a rash and can not use. I will give it to someone.
1,Arrived broken.. such a mess.
1,Received item broken into bits which makes it very difficult to use. I wish I could get full use of the product and it’s color.
1,NO PIGMENT.
1,When I received the bronzer it was completely broken and the powder was all over the packaging. So upsetting.
1,"Super disappointed. I bought this exactly this time last year and only a year into it, it started leaving chunks of bronzer on my face. I was so irritated. I tried using different brushes untill I realized it this stuff. It will NOT last you a while."
1,"arrived shattered, never had a chance to use it."
1,It came broken up and it was a mess all over my other items in the box
1,"This is on me, but I didn’t know before purchasing that the product is scented. I would not have purchased if I had known. There’s no reason to add fragrance to your face. It’s just junk on your skin."
1,Makeup was broken and when I open it it got all over everything. Had to throw away
1,"Arrived broken, wasn’t worth the hassle to return."
1,Arrived totally crushed and crumbled.  There was bronzer all over the box already as if it had been used.  Also noted a weird smell.
1,Bad smell. Like sunscreen/heavy coconut. Did not even open it. Sent it back due to scent.
1,"It's terrible. Doesn't show any sort of shine or glitter effect. Doesn't matter how much you use,  you just don't see it"
1,So I'm paying full price for this broke bronzer...that's bull!
1,"Completely destroyed in shipping, this smells awful too."
1,"This product should be embarrassed to be called bronzer, if anything it’s a matte eyeshadow. Returned."
1,Product arrived broken and bronzer spilled everywhere.
1,"The bronzer came cracked, this is not okay"
1,I dislike that it came broken and messed up in a good protecting bad that shouldn’t be broken . I guess that from the store it came like that I would want to have it again because I had to throw it out it was all dusty
1,I’m disappointed. Bought this in the shade bronzer because I saw multiple swatches and videos that it was suitable for medium skin tones like mine. But what I received was a shade so pale that it would only work on light skin tones. Inaccurate! Perhaps it’s not authentic. Why would the shade pale in comparison so much to what’s reflected on the net
1,I bought this for my mom. When she got the package it was broken. The whole package was broken. And she just left it like that because she didn’t know how to return it. Now its past 30 days and I can’t even return it.
1,The product was all broken when I received it.
1,Came broken
1,"This product arrived shattered in the box, not worth returning, so basically wasted my money."
1,It came broken
1,Broke for the second time!  Buyer wouldn’t let me return.
1,I did not like this bronzer. Smells horrible like coconut can’t stand that you smell it alll day long. It didn’t last as long as other bronzers just not my favorite. Personal review
1,Wtf
1,This product arrived totally broken pieces
1,not natural looking. hard to apply
1,"Crap, doesn’t go on well and has no glo"
1,it arrived to my house completely shattered & made a mess everywhere!!! i had to throw away because it was so messy :(
1,This arrived busted as hell and they wouldn’t replace. Wouldn’t buy again. It’s a shame cause I love this product
1,"when I opened the package, the case and  contents were shattered - like someone stamped on themI could not get together to return - will not order again"
1,This product came in damaged and broken.
1,"when i received the bronzer, it was completely broken. the box was covered i. powder and immediately got my hands covered."
1,This product came completely broken and dust from the bronzer got all over my carpet just from taking it out of the box but I needed to go on a trip so I had to just try to salvage a little bit of it that was still in the tin.
1,My bronzer came completely broken. Everything was loose from the pan. I'm so disappointed. It does smell wonderful though. I wish I could wear it and test the feel of it.
1,I just didn’t like this product I was looking for something with a bit of shimmer and this seems very Matt also I just hate the smell of it conflicts with my fragrance and I just am not someone who loves the scent of coconut and other tropicals.
1,"This product is a knock off, although it looks identical in the component. It smells disgusting and applies orange and patchy"
1,This don’t blend well at all.
1,"It came broken in pieces. Thankfully i had another one I bought from the store, this was a disappointing purchase."
1,All the things I got are broken!
1,Item came completely broken and not usable.
1,"I have never used this before so I don’t have a comparison, but it is NOT like butter.  It was very hard, not creamy. It was impossible to spread on my face even with using primer and a makeup sponge. I was also difficult to remove. I had to scrub it off with a washcloth. The compact itself was not shrink wrapped and I can’t help but think that it was old and dried out."
1,The smell is overpowering and gross.  The fake coconut smell is so nauseating I can’t use it.  Wish it was scent-free!
1,Was delivered broken!
1,This was completely broken when I received it. It made a big mess by getting all over the place because the pieces of the powder got out. =(
1,"Mine arrived broken, the powder was even all over the other items that shipped in box with it."
1,Received my package today and it was broken in pieces.
1,Received product all broken up.  Can’t even use it.

1,I received my product and it was shattered.
1,My bronzer clasp is broken. I cannot close the compact. Very disappointed
1,Very disappointed. Arrived broken. The entries contents were crumbled and falling out of the package.
1,Product came broke.  Powder was all over the place.
1,Extremely yellow and barely any pigment. No clue why this is so highly rated. It's expensive for a mustard colored powder with no pigment!
1,"I don’t think I’ve hated a product more than I’ve hated this one. Doesn’t look good at all. I have no idea why so many beauty guru’s recommend this but it excentuates facial flaws and the smell is horrific. Supposed to be beachy but it smells like Malibu alcohol to me, Literally makes me gag thinking of the last time I drank Malibu in high school. Bleh, no thanks."
1,Came completely shattered and broken
1,This is the only bronzer I buy because of my light complexion but when I received it the color was off. It gave me a harsh orange/rustic look. Next time I’ll just take a trip to the drug store and not order online.
1,"The product arrived broken and the bronzer pieces exploded everywhere in the package. Was excited to try it out, sucks a lot :/"
1,Color is great for fair skin but the fragrance killed it for me.
1,I was so excited to have it but it came broke and damaged 😕💔
1,Broken when I got it
1,I will have to return this bronzer.  I am very fair and this product doesn't even show.  It is not the product's fault but my trial and error until I get it right.
1,Was so excited to have this! Unfortunately it was completely busted and all over my other items in the package! UGHH!!! Would not  suggest buying this online.Didn’t get to try the product
1,DISLIKE
1,Arrived shattered.

1,Hard packed. Hard to apply to face
1,Ita arrived broken
1,It came to me completely broken as soon as I opened it everything came out I’m extremely disappointed of there was a a half star instead of full I would give this .5/10
1,Came broke in a million pieces. I had to throw away
1,Unfortunately it arrived broken so I returned it.
1,It broke less than a week after I bought it. not happy with these purchase.
1,- This product is strongly scented like tropical sunscreen and it's horrible.- Difficult to apply without streaks. Goes on thick.- Probably the cause of my recent breakouts. The creamy consistency + fragrance = Irritating- I do not recommend for oily or combination skin types. Better suited for dry skin and all over application.+ Color is nice
1,It arrived broken
1,"Beautiful product, but absolutely HORRIBLE shipping/packaging. Compact came absolutely shattered and unusable. Completely dissatisfied."
1,THIS ITEM CAME BROKEN HAD TO RETURN
1,"I normally love this item, but I had to throw this one in the trash because it was shattered when it came in. Everything in the box was covered in bronzer."
1,"I just got this today- my first ever bronzer. I purchased it after reading a glowing review of it. I spend a lot of time outside and like when my skin shows it -- but melanoma, no thanks. But I HATE THIS.  I used it very lightly on just one half of my face just to test it out. The perfume stench that comes off of it is so strong that after an hour, I had to scrub my face completely clean.  Even if I could tolerate the smell, I hate the way it looks.  I don't wear a lot of makeup but I do use some foundation, concealer and eyeliner every single day.  Applied lightly to just half of my face, that half of my face looks decidedly ""made up.""  It's clear that powder is filling in the pores on that half of my face.  What a terrible waste of $10."
1,Came open broken
1,"Looks like face is dirty, no matter how much it is blended.  Threw it away."
1,"I ordered the shade ""bronze"" and I was sent ""light bronze"". The product is nice but way too light. I will have to use many layers to even achieve a desired color, if that will even work. I am disappointed."
1,Came late and completely shattered
1,It came completely broken
1,Came completely broken couldn’t use it waste of money
1,Product arrived broken and unusable.
1,Broken in pieces and caused such a mess.
1,Came completely broken. I had to put it back together with alcohol/water.
1,"I don’t know how the formula is but I received mine smashed to pieces and the clasps that keeps it closed was broken, very disappointed"
1,Came broken and got everything else I ordered all powedery and bronzed 😭
1,Arrived broken
1,Arrived shattered. Very disappointed. Even the container was broken and powder was all over the box.
1,I didn't care for how this product looked when applied. You'd have to apply too much to get an even application.
1,"Bronzer came all broken, had to throw it away....dissapointed"
1,came completely broken and shattered. Even the outside box was covered with the product. Would not buy again.
1,I was so excited to receive this product in the mail but it came to me completely crushed!!! Makeup all over the bag and the makeup portion in pieces!!
1,It's broken
1,My bronzer was destroyed no powder left in it
1,i was very disappointed when I received the bronzer today. I opened it up to inspect it and try it out and it the bronzer was broken up in a million pieces and got all over my hands. Not happy. at least they refunded my money promptly. i would have re-ordered but was just afraid that another one would be delivered damaged as well. Wanted it for vacation and won't have enough time to re-order a third time.
1,The bronzing product came all shattered inside the compact and broken up. So disappointed.
1,"The seal to get the cap off left a sticky film that even alcohol couldn’t remove, and the idea of using that same sponge on my face every day is gross. Too much product comes out also- I do not recommend."
1,it is awful it will not come out and is to thick
1,I fell for the hype and bought both the light and the brightener. They are horrible. They end up dry and flaky even after putting on eye cream. It also settles into fine lines immediately after applying it.
1,This product was nothing like the advertisement described it to be.The coverage isn’t good at all.I can still see my under eye circles and everything!!!I give this product a hands down
1,Stopped twisting after 3rd use
1,"If I could give it negative stars, I would. Comes out dry, shows every wrinkle. I hate it!"
1,Misleading
1,Dislike spent almost 8.00 twisted it several times nothing came out on sponge
1,Not what I expected.  Not a fan
1,Feel apart upon receipt awful application
1,Product is nice but the application is messy
1,Still see darkness
1,"It takes minutes to get any product out of the applicator...just amazingly difficult to use, and so off to the bin!"
1,Does not work properly even after several try’s Twisted tip applied pressure down no result
1,"I had to press so hard to get any out, I bruised myself."
1,Terrible productCan’t open it to use itHave bought 2
1,Was very difficult to get the product to come out to HUGHES. I would not buy this again.
1,Not easy to spread at all
1,MINUS ONE STAR !!!!!! How is possible to make such a lousy product ??????
1,"I dislike everything about this product,the makeup didn't even come out... It terrible!!!!!"
1,"Nice product, wrong color match - too light for my earthy brown skin."
1,My worst purchase this year.
1,"was empty when it arrived. It was sealed, mut empty. Very disappointed"
1,"I used this product for 2 days in a row that I decided to buy from Amazon, since it was cheaper with subscribe and save. First day, it burned a bit, but thought nothing of it. Second day, the burning lasted and I had welts all over my face. I had to suffer through a work day like this. Soon as I was able to finally wash my face, I had chemical burns everywhere I applied it. Day 3 with no makeup and my face is still on fire. It's peeling, burning, and I'm in a lot of pain. I didn't have this reaction from this product for 2 years until I bought it from Amazon.  I WON'T be buying it from here again!"
1,This consealer was impossible to get out of bottle and would not saturate applicator.  Do not recommend.
1,I bought two. I thought the first on was defective. No. I gave them both a good amount of time before they were trashed. Wasn't worth my time returning.
1,Not happy!! It's like white out with a sponge tipProduct  doesn't  come out easily.  I tried  tapping  on my face  but no success! Not sure what else to do??I will look for another concealer or maybe remove the sponge?
1,The casing is very poor and the product never came out.
1,Way too small!  This was no bargain!!
1,This product does not absorb well into the skin. I always have to add some moisturizer to it.
1,M just open this is broken
1,It didn’t work at all. The make up doesn’t come out of the sponge tip. It was a waste of money for me.
1,This is crap. You can’t get any of the make up to come out.
1,"I bought this assuming it was cruelty free, as that is the standard nowadays, but after looking at the bottle and not seeing the leaping bunny logo (a symbol to show if a product i cruelty free or not) i looked it up and found out it was not cruelty free. since i had already used it once i couldn't return the product meaning i had to use it all knowing i was supporting animal cruelty. Maybelline pays people to test on animals, and I can't ever support that willingly ever again. While yes, this product is decent, i will never be purchasing it again."
1,"I was so excited about this product from reading other reviews. I opened the package, looked for directions on how to release the makeup to the applicator and never could get it to come out. Maybe I got a lemon but I was very disappointed."
1,Makeup does not come out of the tube no matter how many times I twist it. Full of makeup but is useless.
1,I cannot rate the product because it is clearly old and dried up.Damn disappointed.
1,Product does not dispense from container. Couldn’t get it out so couldn’t use product. Very disappointed.
1,Unable to manage dispensing the contents of applicator. Poor quality product
1,Coverage wasn't great. The applicator was actually painful to apply directly to my face.
1,Dont waste your money.  It doesnt come out and fill the applicator!  Absolutely waste of my hard earned money!
1,I wasn’t even able to open it. The container felt very very light and I believe it to be defective. I was excited to try it.
1,"I was excited to try this out, but immediately had to remove it because it started burning my skin below my eyes super bad. It took a good half hour to stop the sensation after washing it off my face. I'm not sure if I was sent a fake or what, but I'll be returning it ASAP! Stay away!"
1,"It was thick and difficult to blend into skin.  Highlighted areas I wanted to hide.  Really crappy, as expected from drugstore makeup."
1,This concealer stick was impossible to open due to plastic cover. I broke it trying to open it. Badly designed product.
1,It was dry and did not work at all!!!  Very disappointed in this product!!!  DO NOT BUY!!!
1,NOT EASY TO APPLY EVEN IF I COULD GET IT OUT IT IS A VERY VERY VERY SMALL DOTTER ON SPONGE APPLICATOR! NEVER AGAIN>>I THREW IT OUT!
1,"Hard to use, dry barely any product in the tube … never buy again"
1,It didn't blend well and it didn't help with my wrinkles.
1,Lousy design. The makeup wont come out. The sponge top rips. I should have returned. Its unesable
1,"This is for this specific one I bought from Amazon, not the actual maybelline product, which I love! Color was accurate but not sure why product was dry and did not spread well! It cracked. I missed the window for return because I didn’t use it right away. What a waste! Buy yours in the store not online"
1,"Just tried this for my under eye bags and if anything it made it look worse.  The built in applicator is flimsy and feels awful on your skin, and it doesn't really help spread the product very well.  I got the palest shade I could and it is still too dark for me.  really would not recommend this product at all."
1,These don’t work….at all. Nothing I did worked nor made the product do what it claimed to do in advertisements. Waste of time and money and easier just to shave off whatever hair you’re trying to rid yourself of with a good old razor. These are not sharp and I personally found these painful and not good for sensitive areas or sensitive skin.
1,I would not recommend. I bought these to remove the soft baby hair on my face. They did not work at all. I threw them out!
1,Packaging was damaged when received
1,Never could get these to cut the hair on my lip!
1,I was so excited to try these but was very disappointed.  It didn't remove the hair and I tried it on many different areas of my face and my arm and nothing worked.  I ended up returning them
1,"I even checked the most recent reviews which were all thrilled and so I had above average expectations.  When the first one pushed one persistent lone hair on my jaw line, I tried the others.All of them were more like a brush than a razor.  Yet, holding a piece of paper, they would make a slash so there is something representing a blade but not razor like."
1,"This literally did nothing to remove my facial hair.  If you have light, thin hair you're trying to get rid of then give it a try, but if you have stubborn hair that usually requires tweezers, lasers or a regular razor this is not the product for you."
1,The blades were dull and tore my skin up. I used one threw away two.
1,These didn’t do anything and didn’t take off the hair. I do not recommend
1,If I could give no stars I would. They are worthless. No hair removal at all.
1,Made my face very itchy!Cuts easily- these are by far the worst razors I’ve used for my brows. 10/10 do not recommend.
1,theae are not worth purchasing.  They are dull and do not dermaplane the facial skin.  I do not recommend.
1,These left tiny cuts all over my face and then I broke our horribly a few days later! I definitely would not recommend these
1,These are not at all smooth. They feel like dull razors that have been used too many times. Awful product. Don't buy these.
1,I wish I could give it 0 stars the razors were very dull I was so disappointed 😞!
1,Do not waste your money!!! This is a terrible product and literally burned my skin
1,"I typically use an electric razor to get rid of my unwanted facial hair but wanted to try this since it also has the benefit of getting rid of dead skin. I was so dissapointed after trying multiple ways to remove my very thin blonde hairs above my eyebrows. The end result was a huge mess, with some hairs completely gone, some half cut and some still there. I ended up using my razor."
1,These sucked I used all 3 once and each time they broke and the razor blade fell out!
1,Useless.  Removed nothing.
1,buyer beware not even worth the price very dull
1,"If you want to try dermablading, go to a professional! These are absolutely awful for sensitive skin! I used on my upper lip and the day after my skin was a mess. Two weeks and 15 pimples later, I’m still not back to normal."
1,"Don’t recommend, not sharp at all"
1,"Not for me. Give me a battery power one any day. Bic razor easier to use. Hurt, cuts skin"
1,not worth itdull blades
1,"These were dull and didn't work no matter how much pressure I used, angle I tilted it, and whether it was on dry or wet skin. Really disappointed."
1,This thing has cause a horrible in grown hair in my bikini area. That has swollen to the size of a quarter. So these 5 dollar razors will cost me 300 in doctor bills.
1,I wouldn't buy these again. All they do is scratch your skin. Useless.
1,"These did NOTHING. They did not work like they claimed they would. Did not remove any hair. Just made the skin I used them on dry, flaky and irritated. Will not purchase again."
1,This took of no hair but did scrape my skin especially the sensitive skin on upper lip. Impossible to maneuver for brows
1,These razors don't do it for me. They don't shave off much of my facial hair. They feel dull after one use!
1,Awful. Just use a disposable razor if you want a blade on your face.
1,"It's like a tiny, dull straight razor. Hard to use, takes a long time, and still does a terrible job. Just use a regular razor or shaver. I cannot believe I fell for this one AND I bought two packs. All six pieces went right into the garbage."
1,"These are awful, very hard to use and will hurt sensative skin."
1,Jagged end that scratches skin and gives skin rash and red bumps
1,"This is listed as #1 bikini shaver, but it's way too dull for that"
1,"Terrible. Not sharp, had to keep going back over. Ended up plucking."
1,These don't remove peach fuzz or anything else. The only use would be to scratch your face if you're itchy. Not worth it.
1,Really like these. You can seethe dead skin and peach fuzz it removes from your face. Not very expensive either. I usually use hair remover and it's so harsh on your skin. I haven't used it in months since I bought these
1,Dull. Doesn’t work. Don’t buy.
1,Terrible..hurts pulls and not like a straight razor..has little notches that will mess you up. Might be good for something but not the face! I do use their regular razors and they are great..disappointed in this ☹
1,Useless.
1,Keep getting cut by the end of the blade I have used other touch up blades and have never been cut by them
1,You could buy a straight razor and get the same affect. Not impressed. It’s like they cut a razor blade in half and stick it into a plastic handle.
1,Idk why the tip keeps cutting my face no matter how I try and move my face. Just can’t use these without getting cut.  Wouldn’t recommend.
1,Product left red marks on my skin and I was not pushing hard at all. I do not have sensitive skin. Would not recommend this product.
1,Not for sensitive skin and will not remove fine hair.
1,"Honestly, these were awful for me. I felt like they weren't sharp enough to do what they say they do. I felt like I really had to scrape to get any peach fuzz off, and then my face was so angry for a few days afterwards. All they did was irritate my skin. I also couldn't get the eyebrow thing to work. When I had the attachment on I couldn't get it at an angle on my eyebrows that would actually remove any hair. They went in the trash."
1,Be careful while using... These might cut ... I got cut on my check and chin .... not so smooth blades .... it’s harsh and leads to cuts
1,Terrible product. Does not work at all. Feel like I’m scraping my face with a butter knife
1,I broke out in an insane rash after using these once.  It was so bad I had to take Benadryl. I have never had a reaction to anything like this before.
1,Basically a bic razor. I have sensitive skin and this hurt to use. Very dull and did not remove peach fuzz like it says.
1,"I have used multiple brands of personal razors like this over the last few years and so when it was time to order new ones, I decided to give this brand a try. I used the first out of the package this morning in the shower and on the second swipe along the side of my face (side burn area), I cut myself. Not a scratch, but a true cut an inch or so long that bled for several minutes. I was using the razor the same way I have always done, but this one has a very sharp leading edge that i was not expecting and do not feel is safe for use on the face. These will be going in the trash!"
1,"Yikes, these are painful for sensitive skin. Can't really maneuver it for delicate eyebrow work. Literally feels like you are rubbing sandpaper across your skin."
1,"I dunno, the things were pretty much worthless. I kind of expected them to work as a mini razor ~ didn't happen.  they scrape and drag across your skin, and in sensitive areas? ugh.don't buy unless you have no other choices."
1,Is not what I expected it.  The quality is not good.
1,I have used many brands of the dermaplane tools. These are by far the worst.  The end of the blade ended up catching on my skin (a smooth area) and scratching about 2 inches down my cheek. I have never had this problem. Don’t buy.  Tinkle or Flawless by Finishing Touch are much better inexpensive brands to purchase.
1,"just completely ineffective, very poor hair eyebrow trim remover, very irritating to skin, might as well used sandpaper"
1,Have cut myself twice around my nostril area from using this. Seems to dull my skin after using it. Think just using a razor does a better job due to skin issues.
1,Not happy with product. Did not work not satisfied at all.
1,Doesn’t work as well as the ads on tv. Do not recommend for sensitive skin.
1,I had a reaction to this on my neckItchy rash after using
1,"The blade is dull; thus, takes more strokes; as a result, more dangerous. I will never buy this again."
1,"Was not a fan at all! This feels SO scratchy when you rip it across your skin. I say rip, because this does not glide in any way, shape, or form. It feels like it would be used to remove the pills off an old sweater, not peach fuzz off your face. I tried all three in the pack, thinking maybe it was a fluke. Nope. I would NEVER recommend these."
1,By far the worst product I ever purchased from Amazon. Horrible quality- will cut your skin.
1,Horrible. Do not recommend for sensitive skin I broke out really badly. Plus hair grows back fast and it’s bumpy
1,These didn’t do the job for me. Trying to remove hair was a struggle and I’m not sure if it had to do with the blade not being as sharp as it should. I noticed when I would try to remove hair nothing would come off and it would end up just making the area around my eyebrows ashy
1,"It does not work.  Tried it at various directions and angles, but didn’t get any hair off. Very disappointed"
1,"These are way too big and chunky to be used on the face, especially near eyebrows. I have used many different blades to remove fine hair and clean up by eyebrows. These sliced by face terribly. They performed to the equivalent of taking a jagged tin can to my skin. Awful!"
1,I used this and thought it was safe but I cut my eyebrow
1,Horrible and Dangerous- that’s all I have to say. I cut my cheek very badly and it does not come with safety directions or have a video on proper use!
1,"Not sure if I received a very dull set or the razors are just not that good as everyone say they are. I tried all three razors and none of them were sharp enough to remove any hair off my face. I tried wetting my face, nothing. I don’t recommend."
1,I paid for nothing.  The razor blades were so dull it made scratches on my chin (even using moisture to the areas I was shaving).  These need to be taken off the market.  I do not recommend them to anyone for any reason.
1,Not sharp makes it hard to get a smooth dermal plane
1,Waste.  Didn’t do anything.  Stubble on brows now.
1,Dull and will leave your skin red!
1,Hey! Don’t use this. Broke me out like hell. Take your money elsewhere.
1,They barely cut and irritated skin.
1,I bought this thinking I could groom my eyebrows but it was not successful.  A razor worked much  better.  I could not shave certain areas or eyebrow hairs no matter how many times I tried.
1,"I don't know why these have such high reviews. #1. It doesn't actually shave the hair, not even the fine hairs on my arm, much less eye brows. #2. It cuts the skin with even when handled gently. So angry!"
1,This tore my face up. I have so many scrapes from this thing. I normally use another brand but gave these a try. Not impressed at all
1,These are worthless. They didn't work what so ever. Absolutely zero hair was removed.
1,"I purchased this item because I read a few good reviews but I threw it in the garbage.  I cut the left side of my face (felt like a paper cut) and it was painful.  I do not recommend but if you want to try it, use caution and use lightly!"
1,"I tried to use this and each time, each angle of the blade, and every attempt it scratched my skin. No dermaplaning at all."
1,"Bad quality razor, cuts your skin very easily."
1,"Literally the worst product I have ever purchased!It does not remove eyebrows, peach fuzz hairs, literally the worst product I have EVER purchased.I am naturally light and have very little peach fuzz and a few eyebrows I wanted to shave off below the brow line.  It doesn’t do ANYTHING! Tried and tried to get two little hairs and it wouldn’t do itTried the peach fuzz above my lip and it wouldn’t even shave that offI couldn’t imagine having dark hair that needed removal.What a colossal waste of money.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME"
1,I didn't like these razors at all and its hard to say why- maybe the size of the blade?  I was afraid to cut my cheek with these.  I will go back to the ones I used before these.
1,Hurts to use it’s like scrapping and afterYour done makes your face burn. Don’t recommend especially for sensitive skin
1,This is junk - don't bother. They are so dull they won't even remove peach fuzz or eyebrow strays. Really worthless.
1,i might have not been using correctly but i did not enjoy using
1,"Too bulky to hold, the design makes it difficult to shape eyebrows. Not for sensitive skin plus the skin in eyebrow area is delicate. For me I felt they were too risky for continued use. Do not recommend."
1,I usually use another brand and these are no where as good. They cut me while doing my peach fuzz on my face which I never had an issue with with other brands. Threw the other two away after using one because how many times it cut me.
1,Completely useless. Like dragging a butter knife across your skin.
1,"Used for shaving random chin hair:  did not shave the hair, and scratched the skin besides.Thorough Disappointment"
1,Not comfortable
1,"Not like any other facial razors I've ever used, OUCH !"
1,Not sharp. Have yo give to or three passes over to cut the hair.
1,So cheap and useless.  What a waste of money!
1,Product received was not Schick. I decided to test the razor anyway - but it did not remove any hair whatsoever. Total waste.
1,I don't recommend it because these are hard to use without cutting part of your eyebrows. They are too big for the area.
1,I seriously hope I’m my face is not scarred for life.  These are terrible.
1,It is hard on the skin and my skin was tingling after using these tools. I was not impressed. I used it once and cleaned the blade and it hasn't removed the downy hairs since...already seems dull.
1,The first one I tried had an uneven cutting surface.
1,"It was a very bad experience on my skin, as it got infected ... and also does not clean the skin well."
1,Painful to use. Used it as directed and was left with scratches and bleeding! Never had this happen with other brands of these tools.
1,"I hated using them, painful and useless don't buy it"
1,Awful cut myself several times in a single use. Cheap product.Lesson learned.
1,"Please don’t buy this cheap product. I just got it, tried it and ruin my skin. It’s a “dull cheap razor“  that cut my face off and didn’t do anything good for my face or my eyebrows! I’d return it if I didn’t ripped the package off!"
1,Horrible. Don’t waste your money. Literally did nothing. Could’ve done better with a butter knife.
1,Blades were/are not at all sharp. Waste of $$
1,My product was broken... the razors are broken off
1,"I have used this type of tool, but not this brand.  When I opened the package and removed the protective cover from the tool I chose, the plastic part of the actual tool broke off and the razor flew out, which of course I had to crawl around and look for.I cannot recommend this product; however, I was issued a refund immediately and the Amazon chat agent was prompt and helpful.Neither the website or IOS app has an option for me to submit a photo."
1,10/10 do not recommend. I’d rather just buy a men’s straight razor than use these again
1,Did not do anything - disappointed!
1,Cut myself within 5 seconds of use. Extremely sharp. I wouldn't recommend exfoliating with this!
1,Don’t buy. Heads dont fit.
1,"I purchased this product last November and was very exciting to receive it...I should have listened to to all the bad reviews!  I don’t think I have used this product for the last 4-6 months because it doesn’t work.  I have changed batteries and nothing, frankly I should have sent it back but usually Amazon sells good products and I was willing to keep trying.  It only got worse and has stopped altogether.  Save yourself time and money and purchase another product.  No stars, had to pick one to submit 😕"
1,Broke almost immediately
1,Rusted within a month. There’s no reason it should’ve done that especially considering I never used it while my face was wet
1,Stopped working in less than a month. Must have used it about 3 times
1,Didn’t take any hair off total waste
1,Hard to remove fine facial hair. Don’t like
1,Female version of a men’s cordless Beard trimmer. Don’t wast your money 😞
1,stopped working.  warranty expired.  Quick money spent.
1,I’ve had this item less than 5 months and it’s quit working even with a new battery. But has slowly been losing its power over the last month or so. Don’t waste your money.
1,This doesn't do a darn thing except look pretty.....the only thing the battery seems to power is the light...there is no sharpness to it...total waste
1,"Had it for 2 months, maybe used it 5x and it broke."
1,"It's been great for about a year, and today it just stopped working.  The light comes on, but the motor died.  It's not the battery.  Disappointed."
1,Horrible! Did not even work
1,Doesn't work. It's pretty and that's about it.
1,This STOPPED WORKING after using for only 2 MONTHS. Changed the battery multiple times.And NO customer service to help.
1,The battery life does not last I only used this twice before the 3rd time the batter ran out and it just stopped working. Would not recommend.
1,This wasn’t good at all.  It doesn’t do what it shows in the video.  Waste of money.
1,This product does not fit replacement heads. Where can I find the correct replacement heads. Ive tried twice now and nothing fits.
1,This product broke on the first use. I had to literally hold the head of it in place because the plastic was so cheap it failed. Do not recommend at all.
1,"Had it for 2 months and it stopped working,I tried a new battery still would not work. This is the second one I have tried and it only lasted about 2 months"
1,"Not impressed at all. Doesn't get all the hairs, and caused ingrown hair and breakouts. Back to my cheap drugstore trimmers that worked so much better. Total waste of time and money."
1,Did not like this item. It doesn’t work at all for me.
1,I was disappointed. not catching hair under Nose.Return for credit.Thank you so much.
1,"Terrible, did not remove any hair whatsoever! I only have peach fuzz and it’s very soft.  This shaver did not work for me."
1,What a waste!
1,It doesn’t remove the hair to where it’s super smooth at least not for me I’m a woman of color maybe my hair is more course so and I don’t really have that many but the few that I do have they ended up being cut very stubbly
1,Does not work well.
1,I cant open the thing where we put the battery. It is too darn hard even my husband cant. I havent used it. Hoping someone can tell me how… i even watched Youtube how to pull and put battery
1,"I had this brand for about two years and it finally died about a month ago, I wasn't happy with the battery but I thought it's ok I'll get another one. First of all it wasn't sealed when I got it. Second, it doesn't look like the previous one that I had at all so I'm not sure if they modified it or it's just not original. Anyhow I'm returning it."
1,"Unfortunately,  this item did not remove any ""peach fuzz"" hair on my face.  Very disappointed. Sent back."
1,"So, I'm a little grossed out.  I put in the battery and turned it on and started to use it according to directions.  Then it started to shudder and wasn't working properly.  Thought it was the battery that came with it, so I put in a new battery and it did the same.  Then I took off the top cap that covers the blade and it was loaded with someone else's hair!  So gross!!!"
1,Package was damaged in transit so I can’t tell if it had been open before.  The battery was missing and it doesn’t work as well as the old one l was replacing.
1,Doesn’t work that well
1,Didn’t last even few months- poor quality! Don’t waste your money!!
1,"This did not work for me at all!  Did not remove hair easily or fully,"
1,"This product hurt like heck! They say it's painless, but I beg to differ. This hair remover doesn't cut the hair, it pulls it out. You end up with sore red skin and bumps from all the removal spots."
1,I’ve used this at least 10 times over the past couple months and it just doesn’t work for me. I have a lot of peach fuzz on my face and it doesn’t get it off. No matter how many times I go over a spot it still has so much hair. I’ve tried moving it in different directions but no help. My last razor was so much better. It broke after 10+ years so I thought I would give this a try but I hate it. I’ll be repurchasing my old one.
1,Doesnt trim off anything. Absolutely worthless.
1,I was disappointed in the quality of this.  I really thought it would remove chin hairs. All it did was pinch skin and no clear hair removal.
1,"Bought for a gift. Bought it to early because the return time expired shortly after giving it. She tried using it but it never worked right. When she opened it to empty the contents, the pieces inside feel out. Not work the money. Very disappointing."
1,It has only been a month the product has stopped working
1,"Not sure what to think of this product-I liked the way it left my skin smooth and hair-free, however, it stopped working after 5 months of light use !  I've researched all the trouble shooting subjects and can't pinpoint an issue-only thing I can point to is the trouble started after I replaced the battery, and some people have pointed out it could be an alignment issue w/the shaver head.Very frustrating--------"
1,Not worth it.
1,"This causes ingrown hairs to irrupt like crazy. I’ve tried it several times, and always the same result. Waste of money."
1,It stopped working after little usage. The battery was changed which I didn’t consider a problem. It runs but does not connect and can no longer be used. It did not work well on my coarser hairs.
1,I bought this to replace an older one I had that was starting to get dull.  This new one is absolutely useless. It doesn't take care of any hair.  There isn't even anything in the chamber to clean! What a waste of money.
1,Doesn't work as described. A complete waste of money.
1,"You buy this product and can't find replacement heads. I've tried multiple times and each time the heads aren't fitting, too small. I try to contact company and no resolution except can't return. Waste of money don't buy bc then you become stuck when time to buy replacement heads."
1,"The one for your eyebrows is phenomenal. It’s like they aren’t even made by the same company. This is total junk. It doesn’t work. All I’ll I’ve done is constantly replace the batteries thinking maybe that’s the problem why it has absolutely no power and doesn’t work the second you touch it to your skin. Do not buy this, it’s trash."
1,"It hurts! It's not for sensitive areas it's worse than a razor and it don't get up close, it leaves so much hair behind.  I wouldn't recommend this product sorry."
1,Does not do anything!! Removes nothing. Also looks to be corrosive as if sitting around in storage. Useless garbage. Very disappointed.
1,"Have had since late April, have used approximately 5 times and it no longer works."
1,Didn’t last very long. No longer works after a few uses.
1,This has to be a cheap knock-off. It feels very cheaply made and it rips the hair out. I’ve used other brands and not had the same issues. Left with ingrown hair and irritated bumps
1,I was not impressed with this trimmer.  Didn't get the job done by any stretch of the imagination.
1,Pulls and catches on the skin.  Not great at removing hairs.
1,New design with double blades does not work as well as the single one. This didn't remove any hair
1,Broke after three months
1,Waste of $20! Didn't work at all. Not sure if it's counterfeit but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone!
1,This is an awful product. It was hard to assemble and didn’t really work well
1,It's not FLAWLESS
1,"Please READ - this product gave me a horrible allergic reaction!  My face was swollen, red and deformed.  After Benadryl and other allergy medicines I was OK and a doctor visit!  Something in the plastic / metal didn’t work for me.  Very scary!"
1,"This is the second product of this kind I have purchased the first one died prematurely but I thought that might just be a defect, purchased another one and it died within 6 months.  Don't buy this product."
1,"It's easy to use and gentle to my skin, but it doesn't do much. If you have like one or two fine hairs on your face, this might work for you, but it didn't do anything for me. I tested it on the fine hairs on my arm as well and it was very time consuming just to shave a very small circular area with very little hair.This is a waste. The cost was low. I feel worse about the waste of resources than the money I spent.This is pretty, but useless."
1,Does not work well the hair does not come off the face easily infact it’s still there would not recommend this product
1,"It was defective, never used."
1,"No rating as I never tried product. I felt a bit suspicious when I was opening the package. The circular seal looked like it had been opened and resealed. It did not line up with the original glue mark. Once I opened, my suspicion was confirmed with a big fingerprint on the top of the cap. No thanks- I want a clean, never been touched by another buyer, product. Disappointed. I will be returning."
1,The battery died on minePut a new AA inWouldn’t start back up ever again
1,Product did not work upon arrival. Even with new batteries. Huge disappointment!
1,"Did not work out of the gate.  No noise, no movement.  And I forgot to return within the time frame.  Total fail, do not waste your money."
1,Didn't work. Hair still there. So I'm not sure what went wrong
1,"The item I received is totally FAULTY.  It is not able to even be opened, at all, so the battery can not be inserted in the item!  This is totally garbage, faulty item, and UNUSABLE! The little thing on top kept falling off and would not stay on.I had to discard it."
1,"This is the second one that I've bought. At first it worked great, but then the batteries that it came with died. I changed them out. It only works good for a day or so then the batteries lose their charge. I will not invest in another one."
1,3rd time I have bought this and it broke in a month
1,Not only does it NOT remove the hair but in fact rips up your flesh leaving the hair somehow intact 😰 pain burning and now scabbing
1,"Waste of money, period."
1,Disappointed. Does not get hair out completely
1,"It doesn’t work at all, it’s a waste of money"
1,"My conair took a turn for the worst after 5 years so I decided to give this a try.Total. Fail. It did NOTHING! Didn't trim, didn't shave, ... It didn't even leave the head dirty! What a waste!Back to Conair for me, in another five years it will be more satisfactory to just flush twenty bucks down the toilet than feel the shame of ever buying another Flawless product"
1,"It did not cut the hair, it pulled it out and caused a rash. I only used once. I dont recommend this product."
1,Didn't do anything at all. Not one peach fuzz cut. Sheer junk
1,Do not like.
1,"I should’ve looked at the reviews. This product did actually work really well for me. My skin was completely smooth. However, I broke out SO bad all over my face. I hardly ever get more than one or two small pimples at once so this was a shock. It was so bad I didn’t want to leave the house! The pimples were HUGE and they were everywhere I’d used the product so neck, chin, cheeks and around the mouth. It’s been almost a week and my skin still looks terrible. I’ve used one of these before but a different brand and it didn’t happen. I would avoid this one."
1,Does not turn on!!! I believe it has no battery and you cannot open it. I will not be purchasing this again. This is the second time I bought this and the first one removed hair but the power started to slow down after a few uses. I done with this!
1,TERRIBLE.. you have to press down on your skin really hard for it to actually remove hair and it hurts ALOT. My skin is red afterwards. It almost feels like it’s pulling it but really patchy. Look elsewhere.
1,This is a horrible product. Hair grew to be harder after one use. Booty sure why so highly rated
1,"This hair remover is very weak.  Even if you go over and over the chin hair, it doesn't remove most of them."
1,Used once - worked pretty well.  Used a second time and it died.  The battery is working but it's not trimming anything now!  Ridiculous!
1,This pinched my skin and did NOT leave a smooth surface. Missed hair everywhere. I gave it away. Do not bother!!!
1,"Uggg, I can't believe I only had 30 days to return. I tried it and it did not remove  my hairs. So I decided to wait 2 more weeks to try again but again, did not work. I still have to ""shave "" my chin area every morning.  I'm so disappointed. Waste of money. Does not work."
1,"It stopped working after only two uses. I thought it was out of battery, so replaced the batteries. But nope it is broken. Very Disappointing."
1,Used twice and it does not work do not recommend  it
1,The light is annoying and doesn't help. The blades pinch. It only sheers peach fuzz after you trim the fuzz ahead of time. Don't use it on hair courser than the finest peach fuzz because it will not work.
1,Fake! The head doesn’t work at all even during first use!
1,"These do not fit on flawless head. Only need to change heads every 6 months so by the time I tried to use them, too late to return. Ripped off."
1,This stopped working after just a handful of uses. It stopped spinning. I took the top off to clean it and it still won't work. I absolutely regret this purchase.
1,"This product did not come with a battery like it stated. When I put the battery in it, it doesn’t work. Won’t even come one. I believe I received a defective one."
1,This powder smells horrible and frankly the smell isn’t worth the feel (not that great…had/have much better).
1,"If you ever take any advice from me, DO NOT BUY THIS. You will smell like an egg that resurfaced from the 1800's. My ENTIRE house smelt like this. I am talking all 3,000 sq feet of my house smelt like satans #2. I thought I was tough, I thought that I could handle the smell. But boy... was I wrong. This will bring a dead man back to life. After lighting 12 candles, Febreeze, and Ozium, the smell still lingers. This product is no different, actually, I take that back this product is Nair's evil step sister. But seriously, same idea as Nair, more mess since you have to basically become a chemist to make it, and the smell... well you got the point."
1,"This left my beard hella patchy. I have to go into work tomorrow looking crazy because of this. I left the product on for 8-10 minutes until I couldn't stand the rotten egg smell anymore. I had doubts trying it and I was right. It did remove a majority of my hair but it its not smooth, and there are big hair patches left. Even where it did remove the hair there is still stubble. 0/10 just shave. My skin is also extremely sensitive from this when my skin is never sensitive to anything else."
1,Make sure you’re not wearing jewelry because there is something in the product that ruins them. They will tarnish.Also the smell is awful.Great news though! The product works…
1,"Followed the instructions, including testing on my arm 1st.No problem there except the horrible smell,similar to old perm solution. It does remove most of the hair.But very quickly after applying to face,it began burning.Rinsed immediately and went to the local ER,where I was treated and sent home with various medications and creams,which I used as directed. I had blisters and angry swollen skin on bottom half of my face.it was extremely painful. Its been about 3 1/2 weeks now,and while healed,there is scarring. I would most definitely NOT recommend this product to ANYONE."
1,A girl on tik tok hyped this up to be the best stuff ever. So I knew I had to try. I bought it and mixed it up. It’s the worst stench of rotten eggs and throw up. It lingers for a long time. Anything it touches has to be bleached or thrown away. And it gave me minor burns. Did a worse job than my razor. It was horrible.
1,It is on my skin right now.  So far safe enough for my skin. But the smell. It's like rotten eggs. I have a headache just waiting for the 5-7 mintues to pass. Idk if I can take it. On top of that. It exploed in the packaging and had to dump it in my skin to prevent a mess. Buy at your own risk.
1,Do not use on armpits it will burn them and and leave u with a red rash 😭😭 awful smell too 0/0
1,This stunk up my whole house for hours!!! And it didn't even remove all the hair it was supposed to remove!
1,Awful I got a reallyyyy bad chemical burn do not use and it smells awful
1,I have not sensitive skin at all but this is extremely aggressive with your skin. Don’t get it!
1,Was absolutely horrible! Smelled awful and left chemical type burns on my legs. Don’t waste your money.
1,This product gave me a chemical burn.  It did not work well.  Dried up too fast. Made the whole house smell like rotten eggs. I threw it away.  Don’t waste your money.  Horrible product and messy too!
1,Product works but smells horrible and is extremely messy. Made my whole Bathroom smell bad for hours and powder is messy.
1,"this product is garbage. it smells like a a tin can full of old farts. It's not effective either. It made my entire apartment smell awful and i  had to throw it away immediately.Just, dont do it. It seems like itll be a good idea. its not. it did nothing.All these people on here have LITERAL burns.The scent alone is such an assault on the senses, they should really be paying the customer to take this crap off their hands... not the other way around.Its a no for me, dog."
1,I really disliked how it smelled terrible. My whole house reeked!
1,I would never put anything on my skin that smells like death and rotting eggs. Do not buy this it seems toxic to humans
1,"The smell of this horrible. I couldn't get past it.  It smelled like 753 rotten eggs. Just go the old school route of shaving, razor and cream."
1,terrible product. do not recommend..
1,I liked how it kinda worked but it really stinks.  It can be used on sensitive skin but dries it out also.
1,"Reading the other reviews, I was aware of the smell BUT the smell was out of this world. The smell of rotten eggs filled my entire house. Disgusting! Second problem was it turned the bottom of my bathtub brown, I had to scrub it out with pure bleach. Last but not least, it left a white haze on my legs and had to scrub it off a few times. Bottom line is, I rather just use a good ole fashion razor! Too much work, mess and oder!"
1,Doesn’t even work!literally a waste of money!
1,"ok so i don't typically write reviews but i felt that in this case, it would be an injustice to the people if i did not speak my truth. so basically, as a naive teenage girl who was unfortunately blessed with some indian genetics (aka hairier than the average person), i saw this product on... yes... tiktok IM SORRY OK but usually tiktok has some good recommendations. however, this did not deliver. i followed the instructions pretty exactly and nothing burned or anything but only some of my hair came off and definitely not enough to justify the pain of mixing it and applying it and all that good stuff. then i rinsed it all out cleaned everything up whatever did my thing and you'd think ok, not the greatest results but hey whatever. but no. the stench of sulfur, sewage, rotting eggs, and the universe raining hellfire upon me filled up the ENTIRE HOUSE even though I literally only used it in my bathroom with the fan on and everything. even after several hours and my feeble attempts at mitigating the smell with perfume, soap, etc. the stench remained and my family got so mad at me and i genuinely felt so bad. basically... it's not worth it. blaming jeff bezos for this one i don't even care if it isn't his fault <3"
1,Supper stinky. Leaves skin dry. Not good
1,"I give this product 0 stars. The smells is horrible, it smells so badly like rotten eggs it stunk up my whole house. It didn’t take any hair off, and I couldn’t even get it off. It took so much wiping and rinsing. Do not recommend."
1,This is the worst smelling! My entire main floor smelled like a dead man farted after dying from eating rotten eggs
1,If you want to burn and hurt this is the product for you. Horrible stuff. I also mailed them back and still have not gotten my refund
1,"It had seriously the WORST smell I think I've ever smelt in my entire life. Imagine an egg salad, a dog ate it, vomited it up, then proceeded to eat it then have diarrhea... thats what it smelt like. And it filled up the whole house. Had to open up all of the windows in the heat of summer which just added to the uncomfortable oder.And to top it all off. It didn't remove the hair.I HIGHLY recommend NOT buying it. Don't do it."
1,Doesn't really work and stinks to high heaven. My wife used it on her legs after watching some viral tik tok video and I threatened to send her into the backyard to hose her off
1,-0 stars it will remove the hair and your skin with it don’t recommend it destroyed my face I have burns and cuts all over 🤬
1,"Smells really bad, stunk up the whole upstairs"
1,Awful smelling and didn’t work.
1,The worst smell. Stunk up my house for 2 days. Disgusting
1,I’m not a big fan of hair removing products but thought I’d give this a try. I didn’t like it. Too hard to use and not worth the time commitment. I’d rather shave.
1,(Review written by my wife) Look this product works but I would never buy again!!! Ever! This stuff smelled horrible stunk up the whole entire house. And do NOT let this get on to nails!!! I used my hands to apply and this stuff made my nails WEAK! Also do not let it touch your jewelry my once sliver rings are now a copper color. I would NEVER use again and would NEVER recommend this product to anyone else!!!! Do not use this product!
1,"I did everything the directions said to do. Product didn’t work very well. Burned my face like no tomorrow. Who ever invented this should be shot,"
1,"It smells horrible, like rotten eggs. It made our house smell for 3 days! Then it didn’t even work! Don’t waste your time or money."
1,"This product was CRAP. It stinks SOOO bad. It makes the whole house smell like sewer. It irritated the crap out of my skin. Plus, gave me the itchiest skin EVER.  Highly do not recommend."
1,It broke me out in hives!
1,The nastiest smell on earth. Please don’t buy it. It also didn’t work and caused irritation
1,Stinks sooo bad. Absolutely terrible smell. Clogged the sink.
1,It smelled horrible
1,This smelled literally terrible and it dried my legs out so bad. I felt like my bathroom smelled horrible for days and my legs looked dusty they were so dry
1,"I saw this online and was told it was good for razor bumps which I tend to get a lot of. So I went ahead and bought it. It was the worst decision I had ever made, it made the entire house smell like rotten eggs, and also, did not remove much hair. After about an hour I noticed my skin looks red. I also have no idea how to get the smell out of my house I have already tried a candle, cleaning out everything I used, opening windows and nothing seems to work."
1,Do not buy doesn’t work and breaks you out terribly
1,So gross. If you want to smell like rotten eggs and remove 25% of hair this is the product for you. My whole bathroom smells really bad and even after scrubbing with strong smelling soap i still smell like it. Not sure if I got a bad product but I want my money back.
1,SMELLS AWFUL and does not work at all
1,"When people said it smelled but they used it anyways I thought “oh, it can’t be that bad.” I do not exaggerate in the slightest when I say it smells like something crawled out of Satan’s arse and plagued the house. As I was applying it got progressively more pungent to where I gagged and had to immediately rush to rinse it off as  I heard my fiancé yell from across the house “what IS that smell??” Horrified, I clambered to turn on the vent. Too late.  It permeated through the house like a sewage back up. My dog ran to me highly alarmed and then as she sensed that I was the origin of the source of smell.. I saw the whites of her eyes as she skittered and ran away from me. My fiancé said I’m banned from our room and is making loud gagging noises behind a the door. Screaming, I bagged it up and  ran to throw it outside in the trash. I have fans on, candles lit and febreezed the whole house. It has seeped into my skin, I STINK like rotten egg salad leaving a trail of stink wherever I go in the house. I couldn’t even review the product itself, I was gagging and had to wash it off. SOS. Send help.  Nothing is worth this."
1,This irritates my skin so so much. I was careful and followed instructions but I was still left with a rash that burned.
1,"This smells so bad, made my whole house smell for days!!"
1,"I have no skin sensitivities other than fragrance, somewhat, which is why I got the fragrance free one. I use the product 1 time in a specific spot and it worked like a charm. So I continued to do the areas I most wanted to get done. Keeping in mind I never went over the same area twice. Later on, about 20 minutes, a friend and I start feeling a stinging sensation. She was either having an allergic reaction or she got burned. Me on other hand feel as tho I was burned. I tried it on my facial hair and now my face feel as though it is raw and exposed. It got the hair off but the side effects are so bad. I hate to say it because this is my first bad review of any product, but this is so bad. It works great but the aftercare is a hassle and it’s not worth it. Their ain’t nothing magical about it."
1,Smells awful and stinks up the bathroom and entire hallway.  Made my skin break out everywhere product was used.
1,"Not for sensitive skin, smell is awful"
1,"I bought this item after it came recommended online. I didn't read the reviews as I've been shaving for some 30 odd years, using various razors and creams. Either a product takes the hair off or out doesn't. Either you get chemical burns, or you don't. This isn't rocket science. Oh how naive I was.The good news is that there weren't any chemical burns. The bad news is that all the hair was still there. The worse news was the horrible stench the permeated my almost 2000 Sq for home. It stench didn't just stay inside the closed bathroom door that was inside a closed bedroom. Oh no, it traveled into both my kiddos' bedroom, down the hall, into the living room, and slightly into the kitchen. So I then had to decide whether I should open the windows, let the cold on, and risk my neighbors calling the police to report a decaying body, or slowly suffocate.Given I had appointments the following day, and worried that I would smell like walking death, I opted to open the windows and huddle under a heated blanket contemplating my life decisions that led me to my current predicament. Then I had to break out my razor and shave"
1,"i followed instructions, but still ended up with some painful chemical burns for a few weeks. smells really bad and didn’t even remove the hair"
1,I did like it how it works but it will make everywhere you put it stink bad and it stinks really bad when you put water in it
1,it irritated my skin and I don't have sensitive skin at all. it smelt like rotten eggs and milk and it dried my skin out for weeks.
1,"i don’t think any of these reviews quite capture how utterly RANCID this powder is. i’m writing this next to a candle, perfume in hand, and with veRy scented lotion on legs and all i can smell IS ROTTEN EGGS. the slight convenience of not having to shave is not at all worth how bad my entire bathroom and any room i’m in smells right now. i literally spent an hour scrubbing my shower walls and counter tops and it’s STILL THERE. i wish i was born without a nose."
1,Smell is terrible and it only takes off like 1/3 of the hair.
1,This smells like an egg fart and the smell lingers even after washing. GROSS. It also did not work for my husband.
1,I can’t really say whether or not it’s good for the men. But ladies if you’re using this for your leg hair would not recommend. It got barely any hair off. Plus the smell is practically unbearable. I almost gagged on the smell and I don’t gag easily. Like I said would not recommend it also really dries out your skin
1,I saw this on tik tok the girl said it would smell bad and I thought how bad can it be. Bad is an understatement the SMELL is genuinely and I mean in the worst way possible HORRENDOUS and it’s stunk up my whole house. It’s cheap for a reason.
1,Omg this stuff smells horrid... like old diapers and rotten eggs. I tried it once leaving it on for the directed time and still had a few spots that needed shaving. Made my entire bathroom and bedroom stink for days and couldn’t use the bowl I mixed it in anymore. Not even worth trying. Disgusting.
1,This stuff STINKS! I mean like awful surfer smelling crap. Not to mention it didn’t to a good job of removing hair on my legs. I will never use this stuff again. I trashed it after my first experience.
1,"Not for sensitive skin at all. Burns, dried my skin out. Scent of it just plain stinks"
1,This one smelled like sewage!!  Burnt my fiance's skin.  Gave him a burning sensation and then the product broke his skin out.  Just not for us.  May work perfect for others but if you have sensitive skin I wouldn't recommend.
1,"Barf, the smell alone is enough to make you vomit. Never used it on my skin as I couldn’t get past the smell."
1,Smells horrible
1,Works well smells HORRIBLE
1,Smells like rotten eggs and hurt my armpits. TikTok lied.
1,This was so stinky and didn’t last more than a day. Not much different than shaving everyday. No magic here.
1,I hate it. It didn’t work well I tried different ways and it made my skin feel terrible. Chalky and dry and overall clogged and gross. The scent isn’t terrible but it lingers so so long especially on your skin.
1,"It did not work for me, caused me to get a very bad chemical burn, and it smells AWFUL. Beware. Especially if you have sensitive skin."
1,"If you are thinking of using this, think again. I used it on my face and it left me we terrible burns and it didn't even get all the hair. I wonder if this product is directed to a specific hair type because this did not do what It said it would."
1,"My moisturizer was expired by 5 years. I won’t be purchasing from them again, I’ll pay a little extra to get it from my local Target where I know it’s not expired."
1,"For starters I have combination skin, it mainly gets dry and only water-based moisturizers work for me. Normally I barely ever get pimples, but my pores clog easily and my skin is also sensitive.  I used this moisturizer a couple years ago and it did wonders for my skin & i absolutely loved it. However after I started using this one my face was covered in the most painful, irritating pimples. It left an oily film on my skin which i did not experience the first time i used it. Its taken my skin a couple days to start healing after i stopped using it, my pimples are starting to go away and my skin isnt looking as bad anymore. I wouldnt recommend  buying this, I would advice someone to go and purchase directly from a store as some products on amazon are fake."
1,"Packaging came slightly broken, the product inside had already coagulated and became one giant jelly-like pile when it arrived. Very different from some pictures on here."
1,"This product looked sketchy as soon as I opened it. Like a solid chunk, pulled away from the sides of the container. After looking at other reviews that posted pictures I decided to try it anyway. Seemed ok the first day, but then I had the worst cystic acne breakout I’ve had in years."
1,"If you are allergic to fragrance, this is not for you. The smell was unbearable. Triggered an instant migraine. I have used other products with beeswax that did not smell like this."
1,Doesn’t work at all. Waste of money
1,"This product has caused my entire face to look 20 years older over night! My neck and face is burning. I did not put it on my eyes but some of it must have spread to my under eye area because that area is red, blustered, puffy and extremely wrinkled. The same with my neck. This happened a month or so ago but I thought I had a crazy allergic reaction from someone outside. I put nothing on my face for a month and it got better. I decided to put the Neutrogena hydroboost night serum on last night and I woke up this morning looking like a monster! I am so scared of looking in the mirror! This is horrible. I see that other people have had similar reactions to this product. I hope my face returns to normal but this is very scary. This product should be taken off the market! I can’t get a refund because I have had the product for over a month before I started using it. So not only do I have to live with looking like a monster for Lord knows how long. I also can’t get my money back. This is in sane! If my face does not return to normal this is going to be a bag deal. I will have to get plastic surgery(which I promised to never do) just to look normal again… Do not buy this product. It is not safe. I had no idea that Neutrogena was affiliated with Johnson and Johnson!  OMG! This is terribly stressful.BTW: The reviews on this product are the same exact reviews as the other Neutrogena products like the water gel. Isn’t that false advertisement? I am livid! I’m sure you can tell."
1,I used this for a little over a year and swore by it until I realized what ingredients it contains. DO NOT BUY. This stuff is poison and Neutrogena should be ashamed of themselves for what they put in their products.
1,"This product is a scam. Not the real cream, the packaging was ripped and there was no hygienic seal component over the moisturizer. Absolute scam."
1,Came without an internal seal and that is absolutely wrong and disgusting
1,It wasn't creamy it was a hard oily lump.
1,When I opened the product it did not have the safety seal on it... also I have been buying this product for years so I know the smell. Someone tampered with this and added some other product to it.
1,"I received the first jar and it was leaking all over upon receipt. I noticed there wasn't any safety seal and the box seemed damaged. I got a replacement jar and again, no safety seal...just take it out of the box and nothing covering the product. I put a little on my face and it burned immediately.  I don't belive this is the authentic product and discarded."
1,"I have acne prone skin and it gets oily in the summer. I thought I would try this out based on reviews. After about two days my skin was dried out, my acne spots were red and hurt more, and any kind of scab or cut or irritated skin was cracked and bleeding. Needless to say I stopped using it right away. It took a good week or two for my skin to calm down and bounce back. If you choose to try this cream and have sensitive skin, I would try it on a small area of my skin for a couple days first."
1,I don’t think this is the Neutrogena formulation. I have been using samples from my dermatologist and ordered this and my face immediately broke out and dried out way more than if I had not used any moisturizer at all. It was one of the worst breakouts I’ve ever had.
1,My item wasn’t sealed I tried it on my hand but too scared to use it. So wasted my money
1,The box came all beat up and slightly open from the bottom. When I opened the jar there was no seal. I don't trust it. I love the actual cream. I think I'll just buy it from the store from now on.
1,I broke out
1,Terrible smell. Not for sensitive or normal skin. Maybe use to treat leather?Amazon- you are willfully selling a counterfeit product that hundreds of reviews report as burning their skin and eyes!!!! Fix it!
1,"I took the jar out of the packaging and opened it expecting a seal just like the one that comes on the Neutrogena water-gel. There was no seal, the product looked very dry and was pulling away from the sides, and there was a surprisingly strong perfume smell. Like a fool, I put this on my face and now I'm severely broken out."
1,I have sensitive skin and this irritated my face.
1,"This is a fake knock off. Please don’t buy, just go to a CVS."
1,I received the product damaged. There was no seal and product was oozing out. I am highly disappointed.
1,Horrible and previously opened
1,It doesnt work . it felt like it did but then i seen how dry it would be in the mornings so i stopped .
1,Must be a fraudulent product. It has a terrible headache-inducing floral scent. I have been buying this product from Walgreens for at least a year and the Walgreens product is scent free.
1,If you have acne prone skin don't use this! It clogs the pores so bad. It caused cystic acne on my face. Stick with cereve
1,Burned my face severely when used after showering and killed enough of my skin that I wiped off a visible layer of dead skin when I washed my face later the same day.
1,Product was delivered already used. Packaging had been previously opened and the circular seal was missing.
1,"It broke me out even more, didn’t know it was the cause until I stopped using it"
1,Box arrived damaged!
1,Do NOT buy .This stuff is awful it puts horrible rash on my face and also caused some type of chemical burn! I do NOT recommend!
1,"If you have sensitive skin this will BURN! Don't do it. Skin started flaking, visibly red, just terrible..."
1,Did not moisturize and made my acne prone face break out. No scent.
1,"Not sure if it was caused by this product or another external factor, but once I started using this moisturizer, my neck/chin developed tons of acne. My skin also became extremely dry and flaky. I stopped using it a few days ago and ever since my skin has been clearing up."
1,This is stuff is horrible. My face is drier than ever. Something has to be wrong with this batch. Also do not like that there was no cover after I removed the lid. Not very sanitary or safe. I took my chances but this is not worth it!
1,Worst lotion I’ve ever used. The dye and fragrance broke me out horribly and cause my skin to flake and crack. Couldn’t even use it on my body because the formula was so harsh.
1,I received product in damaged box that clearly had been opened and looked used
1,"Dried out my skin and I broke out in horrible cystic acne, the likes of which I’ve never experienced."
1,This is without a doubt the worst product I have ever used. If I could give it 0 stars I would. It caused some slight burning on my skin and a rash. I had to go to a dermatologist for medicine to fix what it did to me. And apparently I'm not the only one who that has happened to. Do not waste your money.
1,Too much fragrance and damaged box
1,"Terribly drying. Left the corners of my mouth burning, red, and raw. Noticeable bumps all over my cheeks which felt like lizard skin. Worst “moisturizer” I’ve ever tried."
1,"I think I'm allergic to this stuff, caused a red rash on my face and neck I stopped using it."
1,"Does not have an expiration date., package appears to be open too.Need to return, as by principle I do not have courage to use any cosmetics or food items without full expiration date directly mentioned (I don't like the coding). They can be harmful."
1,"I had hoped this would be a cheaper dupe for my beloved Peter Thomas Roth Water Drenched Moisturizer, but I was sadly wrong.It smells like cherries, and really doesn’t moisturize at all. My skin soaked it up quickly, and felt drier than it did before applying. I have normal skin. Not oily, not dry.. so this should’ve worked for me. I ended up throwing it out and going back to $50 PTR. I’ll never try to take the cheaper route again. My skin hated me for a solid week after using this."
1,"This product is fake, i compared it to my roommates who has the same product. The fragrance is so heavy, and does not smell good at all. The consistency is the same but the color is blue instead of white. The next time I want to try this I will just buy it from the store. I wish I would have listened to the bad reviews because I can't get a refund."
1,It gives me what looks like a rash on my face and it burns.now that's not to say this isn't perfect for other people who knows why it does that I could be allergic to something in there that I'm not aware of. I'm combination to oily sensitive skin
1,"DO NOT BUY! This product was definetely made for oily skin because it didn’t work on my dry skin. This product made no difference in my skin. In fact, after using this product my skin didn’t feel hydrated, it felt irritated from the fragrance, and it made my skin peel."
1,I’ve now ordered this twice and each time Amazon has sent something that doesn’t match the description- if you have sensitive skin then you may not want a fragrant product which is why I ordered this - unfortunately I keep receiving the one with dyes and fragrance.
1,"The product gave my wife, and I face rashes. I would not recommend this product. I bought four of them and am going to throw them in the trash."
1,I broke out with rash and swelling .
1,It ruined my skin type.
1,"This product does not help with dry skin. When I started using it, my skin felt dry a few minutes after applying. It continued drying out more and more with continued use, now I have to apply Vaseline in places where my skin is peeling since the creme makes my skin dry out so much. Do not recommend and will never buy again!Nice fragrance, but not worth it."
1,Why In the hell does this garbage have so many good reviews??? Haven't you people ever actually had quality face moisturizer? I bought this because I was sick of paying $40 for Belif but I immediately regret buying this as a replacement. Don't do it ladies.
1,"This product caused my skin to break out. The Neutrogena website does not say it’s “Non-comedogenic”. The first week of application, it made my skin feel smooth. I’ve used this for about a month and 1 week. My pores were clogged and inflamed. I do not get acne (minus the one during the time of the month). I have combination, sensitive skin. Was really excited to try this, but I was extremely disappointed."
1,This moisturizer burned when I applied it to my face and made my skin red. Wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin.
1,Burned my skin off. Horrible!!! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! @AMAZON I WANT MY MONEY BACK!
1,"Have used this product at least 10 times and can not recommend it. Put on right after shower. By morning my face feels dry and looking closely, is flaky! Not the least bit hydrating. A waste of money on any level for a skin product."
1,This one is fake as the texture is more of lumpy and condensed. Very unsatisfactory experience as it opened like lump and was not even sealed. Highly questionable item? 🧐
1,"I'm dumb but i felt a burning sensation on my face but still went through with having it on and last night some got on my eyelid and now its red and inflamed around my eyes with dryness especially my right eye lid when I woke up.  I do not think this is the right product, I do not have sensitive skin but I got an allergic reaction"
1,The produce made my skin more dry. I didn't like the scent. It helps with my daughter's skin who has a little problem with acne.
1,No what I expected
1,"love their products keeps my face in glory but for some reason the jell  looks blue instead of white ,,,huh wont buy this on amazon anymore ended up subscribing by a mistake and worried again would it be blue again and yea it was the packaging was ripped Ill never get this moisturizer again from Amazon I'll keep getting it from Target.."
1,Irritated my skin.
1,The scent of this product is horrible.  After putting it on my face I got a headache from the smell.  It irritated my skin; unscented ELF products don't do that to me at all.
1,"This Neutrogena moisturizer has the consistency  of Vaseline and has an awful old lady scent. I have tried to use it  since I paid for  it, but I can't it is going in the trash."
1,"I can’t help but to think this product is not the real deal. I’ve been using this product (bought in store) for months and it has been amazing for me. In fact my skin was the clearest it has been in years. I stupidly ordered it from Amazon this time after running out and after 1 week of use, my skin is fully broken out, dried out and literally painful and constantly burning, almost as if I have severe sunburn or windburn on my face. It burns my skin as soon as I apply it. There is no way this is legitimate. 100% returning it."
1,Not moisturizing at all. After drying on my skin I had to keep applying more. Have to use way too much of this. Waste of money
1,Second time I have had to order was replacement and not interested anymore.  The product is always open when it gets to me and that's gross.  Learn to seal products better.
1,"This moisturizer is not for sensitive skin. I had some sort of reaction that left my skin dry, itchy, and flaky and caused a horrible breakout... and I haven’t had acne in years! I only used it three times. I had the same reaction to the hydroboost face wash on a separate occasion so it must just be something in this line that my skin can’t handle. Proceed with caution!!"
1,"I have naturally dry skin, which is why I bought this product. But after applying it, I have to follow up with a layer of grapeseed oil to actually do the moisturizing, because the product causes my skin to flake within 10 minutes of application. I have been using the product a month, because I though my skin just needed to adjust, but the dryness has worsened, so I'm seeking other products instead."
1,This is unpleasantly thick.  I never had an issue with the Hydro Boot regular or extra dry but this caused breakouts and irritation after three applications.
1,"This product is extremely moisturizing, but it broke me out horribly. If you struggle with acne (even if you use tretinoin like I do) do not go near this product. I think the product should be reevaluated for comedogenic ingredients."
1,I have sensitive skin and when I applied the lotion I felt a burning sensation all over my face. I tried to keep it on for awhile hoping it would settle but it made my face itchy. Will be returning:(
1,Apparently this  new order is not the original product this dried my face out terribly
1,My skin started to burn severely the longer I used this product along with the Ageless Intensives night moisturizer. I had to stop using both of these Neutrogena products.
1,"DO NOT BUY THE WATER GEL IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN. I read the reviews and thought the water gel would be perfect for me, I’ve used it for 2 days and my entire face and neck and eyes are all raw skin that is burning and peeling. My skin is cracking open and bleeding it’s so dry. I tried it on my boyfriend too who never has skin issues and his skin the next day was peeling too it was so dry. This is the WORST product I’ve ever bought for my face."
1,"I've read reviews where people claim ""fake Product' and never felt the same. This time, the product is missing the inner cover, the color looks off and the product does not feel moisturizing as it has on every other occasion."
1,"I have extremely sensitive dry skin and I used this after cleansing my face with a non exfoliating cleanser, it burned immediately and left a sticky film. It also has an offensive odor. Would not recommend this product for anyone with sensitive skin."
1,Has fragrance and irritated my sensitive skin.
1,"I use the pods that contain the Neutrogena overnight hydroboost moisturizing mask so expected this to be similar. Instead, it is extremely drying. I hate using the pods bc they are so environmentally wasteful and a PITA to keep from drying out between uses so was hoping this product would be comparable and less wasteful. It’s not."
1,"This was not the same as the exact same product I got from the grocery store. I think the cream inside was replaced with some other cheap, cocoa butter smelling lotion. No seal and the plastic label is peeling off."
1,"I really wanted to like this product since I've used the mini travel version with no issues; however, after a few applications, I noticed that it started to cause a burning sensation across my face. Not only was it irritating in that aspect but after looking at the ingredients again, there are a bunch of fillers, preservatives (more than the average product) and ingredients the product claims it does not have. For example, it contains mineral oil which clogs pores, despite advertising that it is non-comedogenic. It says it has hyaluronic acid but it's listed towards the end of the list, meaning it has the least amount of it. Overall, it didn't work for me and based on the ingredients, I would not recommend this product."
1,Didn’t like it
1,"I bought this thinking it was the gel to cream lotion, what a mistake. This smell is awful and overpowering, I had to wash my face off almost immediately. It didn’t feel moisturizing either, but I could have lived with it aside from the smell. Just awful!"
1,"The product may be great, but my cream arrived clearly opened and used. There was absolutely no seal on the package (it had been broken) and the box was completely opened on both sides. I am extremely disappointed."
1,There was no quality seal on the box or the container.
1,I had a horrible reaction to this product. Extremely disappointed.
1,It’s hydrating but not for me... I started to break out after using this. Do not recommend to those that have acne problems
1,"The smell is overpowering! And my package from Amazon did not look like the pictures; it looked messy and like someone stuck their finger in and mushed it around. Weirdest of all, this serum made my skin extra dry and flaky. I read that on someone else's review, but just ignored it. Should have saved my money.."
1,"This came smaller than last time I ordered. Only name of item in ENGLISH, rest  in some foireign language . No ingredients on label. Everything else, no idea what said per language barrier.  Plus was like water, not like the  other  same Neutrogena gels I buy in store."
1,"Don’t usually write reviews but I’ve never had such a negative reaction to a Neutrogena product before... my skin is already dry and I only used this for two days before it completely dried out my face. I stopped using this product and have been heavily moisturizing with other Neutrogena products for days (not using this anymore) and my face is still so dry it’s peeling in places. Crazy that this would do exactly the opposite of what it claims AND make things worse... which is why I felt compelled to review. Obviously everyone’s skin is different, this is just what happened to me (but I have read a couple other reviews that stated similar reactions)... hopefully this helps someone"
1,Truly disappointed when I found out that this was a fake product after I checked the batch code at the neutrogena web site.  Please be aware!!
1,Made me break out.  Don’t like the scent.
1,"I received this product very late and when it arrived, the box was smashed and the product inside was used.  The product actually had Spanish letters on the jar.  No bueno."
1,"I have really dry and oily skin that gets even more dry in the colder months. I usually go with lightweight moisturizers so that my skin doesn't get more oily and my pores don't get clogged. This is definitely a light moisturizer. In fact it's so light that it doesn't really do anything at all. Maybe like 5% moisturizing. It just sits on my skin more than anything. I think for the first week it felt like it was working, but then it wasn't doing anything. The good news is that it doesn't seem to be causing breakouts yet. But I know eventually I will be breaking out because of how dry my skin is. I've been using more product than usual but there is so little product that it feels wasteful, especially considering the price. The package is absolutely misleading because of the tiny amount of product that's actually in there. I also hate how fragrant it is, there's no need for that. Overall I'm pretty disappointed. Maybe it works better for folks who don't need as much moisturizer."
1,"I have been using this for two months now. Not only it doesn't help my skin, it is getting even worse. Definitely not recommended!"
1,I finally opened the neutrogena moisturizer.  It was used...half gone.  Really disgusting.  Unfortunately I missed the return date.  From now on I will open the product whether I’m ready or not to use
1,Buyer beware. This is not the true product. It was repackaged and replaced with something else. Very disappointing. I will cancel my monthly subscription for this item.
1,"My skin is so dry and very sensitive. I would have loved to write about the product. When it arrived, nothing was sealed. There was no cellophane wrapping on the box at all. I didn't know used personal items like this could be resold. Id that even legal? It's disgusting. It's such a hassle to return things. I don't drive and I don't live near the post office, so lesson learned. I'll buy from the local Drug store. I'm going to cut my shopping."
1,"I do NOT like this product at all!! I want my money back asap. I hate the fragrance and it's making me breakout like crazy!! I'm actually allergic to fragrance and cant believe this ""top"" selling moisturizer has fragrance in it. Pathetic. DO NOT BUY!!"
1,"Disappointed. Did not even use. Package looked worn. The gel was open, there was no protective film over it."
1,not good
1,This is not fragrance free and my skin  broke out like crazy. Such a bummer.
1,Product was opened and there was no seal on the box or product. Very strong bad scent and seems like a fake product. No returns possible on this product!
1,The bottle came outside of its box (within the packing envelope). I would have been ok with that except there was no safety seal and it looks like some of the product was missing. I went to return the product and there is a no return policy. This is very suspicious and concerning.
1,Their was no seal on product and inside the box on the bottle came all scratched with dirt
1,I like the scent but not good for the scar lighter
1,DON’T BUY!! The item was opened and appeared to be used when it arrived. This is gross. I went to return it and I can’t. I’m angry.
1,I’ve been using this for a month and just learned it’s not pregnancy safe. Why is it advertised for use during pregnancy? It’s contains retinol!
1,"Mineral oil, artificial fragrance, red dye etc. NOT for sensitive skin. Misleading"
1,I don’t trust this product since ur did not come with a seal
1,Did not like anything about the product
1,No difference noticed at all
1,First-time received box was opened and there's no sealed lid inside. Re-requested second time and received the same condition.
1,Paraffinum Liquidum HEALTH RISK: These three are hormone-disrupting chemicals & may form cancer-causing agents. Have also been linked to miscarriages and inhibiting fetal brain development. They are easily absorbed by the skin & research indicates a strong link to liver & kidney cancer.
1,"My aunt suggested I use this, but I did not have stretch marks UNTIL I started using this! It made them worse the more I used this so I Stopped."
1,"I've had this for a few days now and using it morning&night. It seems to work okay(?) on the skin and keep it hydrated... but it has a weird, unpleasant smell to it.... I don't think any product should smell like this."
1,Made the musles in the area were I applied the oil twitch so I stopped using it immediately!Is it suppose to cause that kind of reaction ?
1,Junk ?! Horrible petroleum derived ingredients???!
1,I'm very upset. This was delivered burst open. Everything threw away. Ruined my other purchases as well. I need an immediate replacement!!
1,I do not recommend! I bought it to help prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy and all it did was cause a rash with many itchy bumps that took weeks to go away!!! I only used it for a week before it started.  I only give one star because I can’t post this without giving any! I don’t even give it one star!!!
1,"90K+ reviews and you would expect some truth in it. After going through a full large bottle (6.7oz), i can tell you with confidence that it is not only waste of money but also waste of all the time you put in it. Do not buy. look for something else... also if you have experienced a product that actually works, do let me know"
1,Package comed broken and leaked
1,This is a fake. The bottle had no seal and had missing product.
1,"This product reeks of perfume and is highly unlikely to be an authentic Bio Oil product. With that said, it has failed to deliver on marketing promises."
1,The product was opened. Tried to return or refund and it and it won't let me. Sorry but I'm not going to use an opened product! Guess I just wasted my money!
1,Very disappointed whole bottle gone
1,"I have heard so much about bio oil, and decided to buy this product. I ignored the reviews that said it was counterfeit. I wish I wouldn’t have. This oil burnt my face. It was so red and hurt really bad, I would try and put lotion on it to soothe it and it would make it burn even more so very uncomfortable!Do not use if you have sensitive skin!!!!!"
1,i don’t recommend i used it and it broke me out and didn’t help at all
1,Broke out in a rash
1,Broke me out within a couple hours in a rash/pimple like thing. My skin hated it. I do have pretty sensitive skin though.
1,I get more and bigger scars from this product. I didn’t know that it is very oily which caused my face to break out. I bought it to help the scars from the white/black heads on my forehead but I didn’t  see any changes. I do not recommend this product to people who get acne from oily skin. It will make it worse.
1,"It is not the real deal Bio-Oil.  The oil is very thin, not like the original."
1,This is so fake. Doesn’t work like it describe at all. I would not recommend this for anyone.
1,Have not seen in any results. It stinks .
1,Don't buy it ! It's a fake product and it wasn't even sealed.
1,Bought this product to get rid of stretch marks on my stomach and it was fine at first then after a while the oil made my skin itch and started to get irritated
1,Caused allergic reaction ie rash & itching
1,Fake. Didn’t even come sealed.
1,"I bought this on a whim and should have read up on it more. It smells terrible, like those scented bug sprays they had you use when you were a kid but you knew they were still just chemicals. In addition, I do not feel it’s moisturizing. Finally, there is no way I would recommend this for sensitive skin. The fragrance alone is agitating."
1,"This stuff works like no other product out there. However, this is not real bio oil. Next time I won't be so lazy and I'll just go to cvs! The box was open and the botle wasn't sealed. I have been using this for years, the real one. This one I bought on amazon is thin has a different scent and doesnt look anything like my other bottle.The plastic bottle is even thinner. Buy elsewhere."
1,"I don’t like this bc it has mineral oil in it - I thought it didn’t have mineral oil, which isn’t good for your skin or body."
1,Been buying this product for years. I see no visual effect. I have scar from circumcision from childhood. This product gave me no result.
1,This product is so full of chemicals and caused an allergic reaction.  Use with caution.
1,"Do NOT buy this product. I broke out into really itchy hives right after use. I’ve never had skin issues or allergic reactions to creams, but I got severe contact dermatitis that lasted weeks."
1,Save your money this product has no good ingredients in it. Don’t believe the hype that kim k used it la la la.... it’s awful and unsafe
1,I bought this oil because of the great reviews I saw but when I started applying it my skin got scaly dry patches and when I read more of the reviews some of the comments were suggesting it is fake so I bought another bio oil from ulta and I tested both the one I got from Amazon was oily and my skin didn't absorb it but when I applied the one that I bought from ulta my skin absorbed it and it wasn't sitting on top of my skin. I discarded the oil I bought from Amazon and my skin is going back to normal. I never had a dry scaly skin before applying the oil I got from this seller.i also was disappointed that it doesn't have a safty seal .
1,"This product has red dye, so it is not good for people with sensitive skin or rosacea."
1,This stuff stinks. It’s a strong soap smell. Or a strong smelling lotion. I hate it. If it was unscented I would like it but the odor ruins it. I might just use it on my feet.
1,"I’m concerned that product did not have any safety seal. It was open. After reading all the reviews saying this is not the real bio-oil but a copycat, I am concerned and don’t know if I should use it."
1,Don’t like it an it doesn’t clear up stretch marks
1,My face broke out into so many tiny bumps. It was awful.
1,"My wife wanted bio oil for her pregnant belly and I was reluctant about this product but I got it anyways for her. Well, it was fine the first time she tried it but then she got a rash on her belly and she only stopped itching after she washed it off. This is definitely not for sensitive skin, and because of the chemicals, (this is not a natural product) I would not recommend this for pregnant women."
1,"The product can not be the original, the Smell is terrible. Smells like straight...S%#T"
1,It broke me out
1,I have been using this product twice a day as instructed for a week now and I have a rash developing. Anyone else experience this??
1,"Not sure if this product is the real one, I think it is fake. Strong oily smell and it gave me  rash."
1,This was not the original quality! It caused my 34 week pregnant wife to break out in rashes all over her body and go to the ER. We’ve used this product plenty of times before but bought it from Target and had zero issues. Don’t buy personal care products that have been sitting in Amazon warehouses for who knows how long and in what type of conditions.
1,I could see that the box had been damaged from exposure to a fluid previously.  There was no seal on the bottle. I returned it because I wasn’t sure it had been previously used and that it was not authentic.
1,I’ve never bought this product before but it might be fake. The box was opened and the product had no seal whatsoever.
1,"The smell of this alone irritated my skin. None of what was promised happened, the fragrance made my skin itchy, it takes too long to sink in and never fully does and it didn’t fade my scars. I could only stand to use it a few times, I can’t believe something this strongly scented is marketed to people with sensitive skin."
1,"I heard a lot of good things about the product for acne scars. I used it one night and woke up with hives all over my face. I used to have sensitive skin when I was younger and would get hives often but I haven’t in years. But this product, from using it for one time, has given me residual painful hives all over my face for like two weeks now and I have done EVERYTHING to get rid of my hives and irritation. I have avoided using other products on my face, I use Aquaphor to reduce the dryness, I've replaced my pillow cases and washed my masks numerous times and I still can't get rid of the hives and irritation.  If you have even slightly sensitive skin I would say do not get this."
1,One of the ingredients is not pregnancy safe! I've been using it during the 1 and 2 trimesters and found out the truth! I plan to change immediately. Please check the ingredients before buying and I think the ads are misleading! This should not be branded as a pregnancy-safe product!!
1,"I read a review that said this is not the same bio-oil that she had previously purchased. I thought I would give it a try. She is absolutely right! This does not have the  nice fragrance of Bio-oil. The oil is more thin and more oily, and the coloris a little darker than my current bio-oil.  It i s not at all the quality that I have learned to expect."
1,Received a week after order date and no apologizes at all. Got scar where I used it
1,"If you have sensitive skin, please do not use . It broke me out so bad . I have smalls bumps on my face & it itches."
1,I’ve been using it consistently like it states but I haven’t seen much of a difference. :(
1,I was disappointed at this. I thought it was for the facial wrinkles....but it's very oily. not as I expected.
1,I didn't even want to give them a star at all. this product is fake. I have the real bio oil and its much lighter in color. this fake one is a dark peach color. what made me really realize it wasn't real is when it made my face itch. my face never itched from using bio oil.
1,Product came busted. More than half of it leaked out
1,"I definitely should have read the product reviews first! First off, the smell of this is horrible. It has a very strong medicine type smell. After using this product for 4 days I developed a red bumpy itchy rash on my stomach where I was using it. It’s been a week and a half since I stopped using it and the rash has finally went away but still itches pretty bad. I’ve read reviews of others who have used bio oil before and they’ve said that this one is a fake. I believe it! I don’t recommend this product at all!"
1,This product was literally awful!I used it once and had hives/swellings all over my skin for 4 days!Would not recommend.
1,"I don't have sensitive skin, nor have I had any issues with oils, ointments or lotions in the past. I am putting this oil on my stomach and sides for stretch marks twice a day as the directions say and it is causing a terrible itchy rash over the entire surface the oil is spread.Very sad about it... was looking forward to this helping my pregnancy stretchmarks."
1,"I have used Bio Oil as a face moisturizer for many years and this purchase is total disappointment!  something has changed drastically.  I read a few reviews stating that the product was not the same but trusted my past experience.  Unfortunately, it has changed.  in the past, BioOil always left my skin bright and full of moisture.Im not sure what has changed but when i use it my skin looks dry and ashy and feels dry to the touch.  I am sad to say i need to find a different oil and I'm returning this one.  SO SO Disappointed"
1,It smelled alright and absorbed ok but after two uses I broke out in hives and my skin itched like crazy. I was clearly allergic so stay away if you have sensitive skin.
1,This oil made me break out so bad
1,I purchased this product as I am in my second trimester. I have sensitive skin and used this product twice and each time I broke out in a rash covering my whole lower stomach.
1,"Like other reviewers mentioned, not sure if this is a fake or not. I've used it continuously every day for three months on two small scars. The scars are about six months old. I used generous amounts on each scar, let it dry before putting on clothes. There has been no improvement, no lightening, nothing. The smell is nice, but honestly this was a waste of money as there's no changes. Congrats to everyone that did see improvement, but this was useless for me."
1,This has to be a fake. I’ve tried it for 2 months with absolutely no results.
1,A waste of money!!
1,"I broke out like crazy, the next day."
1,"I do have eczema and very sensitive skin, so I tried using this and it worsened my skin. It made my skin drier, left an over oily film over my skin, and the product itself was a lot smaller than I expected it to be. Not worth the money!"
1,"I dont think this is sanitary, it looks like I got someone's return purchase. Completely unsanityary, unacceptable, especially in the times we're living in. I don't feel safe returning it in case someone else gets the order. This needs to be corrected."
1,"I am so upset that I used a 1/2 bottle of this without researching it more first. This product is full of toxic ingredients such as coumarin - shown yo cause liver damage and retinyl palmitate. Here is a direct quote from the EWG on retinyl palmitate:Too much preformed vitamin A, including retinol, retinyl palmitate, retinyl acetate and retinyl linoleate, can cause a variety of health problems, including liver damage, brittle nails, hair loss, and osteoporosis and hip fractures in older adults. Excessive vitamin A can also cause serious skeletal birth defects in a developing fetus. For that reason, Norwegian health authorities have cautioned women who are pregnant or breastfeeding to avoid cosmetic products with vitamin A (Norwegian SCFS 2012b).Please protect your baby and use something else!"
1,Dislike because no improvement my skin
1,Bought this to use in my second trimester. Within two days I broke out in a horrible rash. Not recommended.
1,This irritates my skin makes me feel dirty. I dont see results with it either
1,"it is oily,  does not absorb into the skin, tried it for 3+month twice a day, my son's scar is not fading or anything.  Only good thing is this does not cause any allergy or make the scar worse.  I am not happy with it since I spend so much time try to chase my son to put it on everyday!  Very Disappointed!!!  Really wish it worked..."
1,"FAKE PRODUCT!!!! WARNING!!! This is not the original Bio-Oil, do not buy!!!! The thickness and color are not the same as the real Bio-Oil"
1,I used this for a few days until I found out it was a fake. Not impressed. I e heard it’s not good for your skin anyways. Sad when I found out I got douped.
1,Disappointed as I bought this twice and I used up the first when I realize this isn’t the real thing as it didn’t do anything - Now I missed the window to return it the second one I mean
1,I received an empty package; the bio oil was not in it!
1,I am always weary of purchasing beauty/health products from Amazon. This product did not come with an inner seal under the cap. That's a major red flag.
1,A waste of my money. Don’t see any use for it.
1,Oh man idk if its cus im pregnant but this smells HORRIBLE! I cannot stand the smell. I honestly regret buying this product!!!
1,There is no seal on the bottle.
1,"I should have read more reviews. As previous reviewers mentioned, this is a fake product. It smells like gasoline and broke me out on my stomach every time I would try to use it."
1,"Fake product mostly just water or extremely diluted, no oily feeling as compared to the same product I purchased from store. Shame on the seller and manufacturer"
1,Noticed no improvement
1,I don’t like it
1,It’s fake not the real bio oil. Wasted my money I’m so upset 😩😩😩
1,This is not the real Bio Oil. Off to Target I go for the genuine article. So frustrating - wish I'd read the reviews first!
1,Horrible smell and feels horrible on the skin.
1,it’s so tiny and it stings your face would not recommend
1,Nothing but low quality products that sit on top of your skin to trick you into thinking its making your skin softer when It isn’t. The Purcellin oil is trademarked by the company which should be a red flag... the ingredients are mostly chemicals that change the texture and “oiliness” of the product but are not chemicals that benefit the skin in any way. I’ve used It for months and saw zero results... if anything it just clogged my pores because the main ingredient (mineral oil) is paraffin!! My skin is softer after using my usual moisturizer and throwing this product away. Always do your research!
1,Arrived w a ripped box and no seals whatsoever on the product. Don’t know if its been used or tempered with. Very disappointed.
1,"The list of ingredients in the description features all the botanicals and naturally derived oils, however when the actual product arrived the first ingredient was Mineral Oil. NOT something I put on my skin. False advertising, I’ll be returning immediately."
1,I've been using for a while now on my stretch Mark's postpartum and the oil isnt seeming to help at all.
1,"This ish don't work, save your money and skin please"
1,"I have been a Bio Oil for many years so I am very familiar with this product.  What I received in no way is the real product.  The scent and texture were nothing like the real product.  Plus, the product did not have a anti-tampering seal on the bottle.  Clearly, the fake product I received had been used. Returned for a refund."
1,Fake products...😡
1,"I am not a particular sensitive skin, but this oil made the C section scar area itchy. I want to use it for the scar, but it kept making it itchy, can't use it for that area."
1,"Not a good fit for my skin, caused more breakouts and discomfort"
1,I  did not receive the product :(
1,I've  tried at least 6 patches on acne with no evidence of reduction in size or eliminating the pimple.
1,Doesn’t work! Don’t waste your money.
1,My son has acne and wanted to try this product.  Unfortunately they do not work at ALL.  Not even a little.  Don't waste your money!
1,"They stick on fine and are easy to remove , I didn’t have any irritation problems but they didn’t reduce the size of my pimple or make the puss come out! I still had to pop the bumps on my own so it defeated the purpose of me buying them. I wouldn’t recommend…"
1,"I don’t recommend it, i bought this for my mom acne and was a waste of money"
1,"This product is not as good as other pimple patch brands, cheap material, does not help with pimples."
1,I don’t break out too much but when I do I want something that will actually get rid of a pimple this was a waste of money for me. Didn’t even reduce the size of pimple.
1,"These don’t work at all :( sadly I have given it multiple chances and it hasn’t helped one bit. Large or small blemish, dry or oily skin - hasn’t made a difference"
1,I tried and it doesn't work for my skin. It just didn't do what it's suppose to on any pimple. The pimples stayed the same and had no difference between a few days of trying the patches.
1,Doesnt work at all. Waste of money
1,horrible. does not even compare to mighty patch or other companies. not effectful at all. waste of money.
1,Didn’t work well.
1,"Unfortunately, I was very disappointed that these little patches did not help me.  Maybe they don't work on white heads and only on pimples.  Anyway, I won't be buying these again."
1,I purchased these for my daughter. She didn’t like them. They didn’t work for her.
1,"This really didn't do anything at all. I tried on several types of blemishes(black head, normal pimple, deep painful pimple, ready to burst white head) and it didn't pull any of it out. A bit disappointing"
1,These work great but I was missing half of the patches. Only came with one sheet.
1,This doesnt do anything at all. If you have peachfuzz itll hurt when you peel em off. The mario badesu pink liquid works wayyyy better.
1,Waste of money
1,They didn't work for me. I used them for days. I'd replace it 2x a day. No improvement and madd swelling worse.
1,Arrived melted and they were all stuck together. I recommended this product previously  but very dissatisfied with the product now
1,Did nothing. Didn’t even stick. These were a complete waste of money.
1,There only one size dot. It was supposed to be a variety pack. I ordered these for the large size. So I’ll be returning.
1,Glad these were not expensive. They stayed on just fine but I had no change on reducing my pimples. Tried the same spot a few times too and nothing.
1,I had high hopes for these but was instantly disappointed. They do nothing. Using this is no more effective than putting scotch tape on your face.
1,These did nothing at all for me. I'd put them on multiple spots for 10+ hours sometimes. When I took them off it didn't pull anything out and I'd just have a little spot with adhesive residue left behind on it. I almost want my money back for these things. 🤦‍♀️ I had so much hope and high expectations just for a waste of money. 😩 Really wanted them to work.
1,The product didn’t seem to really do anything. I tried using a patch over the same pimple for 3 nights in a row without any noticeable improvement.
1,I don’t know I’m not convinced these are the real thing. I’ve gotten ones I know 100% to be the brand before and they work AMAZINGLY. The ones I bought from Amazon don’t do anything. They stick less well to your skin too. I remember the texture of the actual patch being different as well. I’ll be buying directly from the brand website from now on.
1,"I wanted to use this product to help with the painful zits i sometimes get in my face.These did absolutely nothing to the zit.I had the patch on for 4 hrs,tried and then 10.Nothing.The only thing i got was a circle imprint on my face once i removed it.I don’t recommend this if you are wanting to start the healing process of a zit"
1,Adheres well. Difficult to remove. Did nothing for the acne.
1,"Unsure if I just got a bad pack since everyone raves about these, but I used them 3 times overnight on white heads and they did absolutely nothing. Nothing was on the sticker when I pulled them off. And I’ve used other zit stickers before so I know how to use them properly! Very sad because I thought these were gonna be a great product"
1,I have used other brands and thought I would try these. Nothing like the past brand I had from target. Will not purchase these again as they didn't draw anything put and hurt to take off.
1,I’m not all that impressed it don’t do anything from what I noticed pimple was the same as it was when it was applied. Patch was worn for the recommended 6+ hours
1,I don't bfeel like it really did anything. I wore it on several places. Pimples in different stages from red and just appearing to already popped. The only pad to turn white were already popped and even those didn't seem to change from when I put the pads on.
1,This product did not do what it was suppose to. It pulled nothing from white heads and were hard to get off once you put on
1,"I bought this product to see if it’d work on my acne. I tried it on cystic acne, as well as a standard pimple, and it did absolutely nothing. It did adhere well, but the end results(even after 12 hrs) were no different whatsoever from before the patch was applied. I’d even given some to my sister for her to try, and she had the same results."
1,"Complete garbage. I tried all 3 sizes on 5 different spots, all at different stages of development. I took a hot shower as recommended by some reviewers, dried my skin, and then applied. I waited the 8 hours and removed 4. No change whatsoever. I left the fifth one in for several more hours just out of curiosity, and no change there either. These reviews must be scams or else i got a defective product."
1,Made my acne so much worse in the long term. Would not recommend.
1,Mouse has a delayed reaction. I thought it was the mouse pad but it’s just the quality of the mouse.
1,Very cheap. Broke within one month!!!
1,Very cheap but you get what you pay for
1,Frequently lost the pointer on the screen.  Purchased a Logitech at Walmart and threw the Seenda in the trash
1,Mouse worked for two days and stopped working.
1,it literally moves on its own. Like im not touching the mouse and its moving on the screen. Also does that when I am using the mouse which is so frustrating. I just bought it last week. Terrible quality.
1,Going to return due to issues with poor connection.
1,"Total waste of money, what a bummer"
1,"I purchased this mouse in October 2020 because of the glowing reviews, and it stopped working for good today. Loved the green color, but the mouse just wasn’t made to last. The Logitech mouse I had prior lasted for more than three years. The quality of this Seenda mouse just isn’t great."
1,Worked 4 days then quit altogether. Defective.
1,"This mouse is very cheap. It is so lightweight it makes it difficult to navigate around the screen, it is also not very responsive."
1,"I've never ordered a mouse and have it not work before, but this one is just really bad for some reason.  I tried changing the battery to a brand new one, changing the mouse settings in windows, but nothing seems to work in stopping it from lagging on the screen or moving erratically when I move the pointer across the screen.  I returned it immediately."
1,Cute little pink mouse with no on off button. Batteries died within hours. Used it for 3 weeks and then the whole thing stopped working. Save your money.
1,"It hasn't even been two weeks since my child started school and the battery cover will not stay on when sliding the mouse around, does not work and there's no way to turn it off/on to conserve the battery. Very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Very disappointed that this mouse stopped working after three weeks and can no longer be returned! I would rather have a refund and have not wasted my money on a cheap product that doesn't work.
1,"Would work for about 30 seconds, then die. Maybe a minute later, it would work again for a few seconds. Basically worthless."
1,Purchased for my daughter in June for her birthday and she didn't go to use it until this past weekend as that when she got her school laptop.  Mouse is dead out of the box. I have tried multiple batteries and it will work for 2 seconds when I plug it in and then stops working.  Super bummed as she loved the color and that it was quiet mouse but will be going to buy something else. Annoyed that we discovered this past the return window.  Save yourself the trouble and do not buy!!
1,"Opened the box, put a new battery in, light flashed, then nothing. Plugged USB into computer, nothing. Changed to a different new battery. Nothing. Tried a different USB port. Tried a different computer with the battery from a working mouse. Nothing. Only one computer (out of 3 tried) recognized the USB dongle with the ""setting up your device"" message. Returning for a refund. Really, just a waste of time and money. I got a Jelly Comb mouse for the same price a couple of years ago on Amazon and it never quit. I should have just stayed with that when I needed a new one."
1,Stoped working after a few months. Quiet and cute but useless.
1,"I received a hollow mouse, my daughter put a battery in and nothing happened!! it was a fraud.. I requested a refund and sent it back on July 24, I received a partial refund for $5.99 on August 11??? what gives, this is highway robbery for an item that was defective when I received it! would give no stars but the system makes you pick at least one!"
1,It only lasted a few weeks before it stopped working.
1,I’ve already threw the mouse out but the scroll got progressively worse. Good for about a month.
1,Mouse was broken from left side clicker
1,"This is cheap, and you get what you paid for... or maybe you paid too much.There's no on/off switch.The USB connection is tight, almost difficult, almost NOT.And the slider feet on the bottom stick to the surface you're gliding over."
1,Stopped working within a few weeks. Replaced the batteries with no luck. I wouldn’t buy again.
1,The laser stopped working after only a month. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,It simply stop working!
1,Stopped working after 3 days.
1,This product will just randomly stop working while you are using it. Never again will I buy this product.
1,"This thing is a piece of junk. I can’t hardly do anything on the computer. It glitches out often and pretty much has a mind of it’s own. Don’t buy it if you game, because you will end up rage breaking it."
1,This mouse was horrible.  Would intermittently stop working with no discernable reason.  Made them completely unusable.  Spend the money on a better product.
1,This mouse is not of great quality. The buttons are loose and spoil easily. You have to keep shaking the mouse for the battery to get detected.
1,"Worked for a week maybe.  I have to slam it on the desk before it starts to move and at this point it sometimes moves, sometimes doesn't, sometimes moves on it's own as if someone has control of my computer.  It's very frustrating.  You get what you pay for, I guess."
1,return options for something that does not work is crazy.  i cannot get out to return  so now i am stuck wirh an unworkable item plus my money  i buy a lot from amazon and defective items were always picked up by ups  if this continues i will not be doing much business here if this is your new policy
1,Buy at your own risk! Ours is 10 days outside of the Return window and it is no longer functioning properly. 🤦‍♀️
1,Did not work well at all. It kept tweaking. Returned it!
1,"using the mouse, the cursor doesn't track but rather jumps all over the page or doesn't work at all.  I've used Logitech before - had three and each one worked for about three years.  I am ordering another one today.  This one is useless."
1,"Bought in April.  Within 3 months, the cursor could not be controlled - like it has a mind of its own.  Going back to Logictech even though I don’t care for the clicking.  At least Logictech lasts years and not months - like this seenda and also Wisfox."
1,"This mouse worked for about a month, and no longer worked, even with changing battery. The mouse from a different computer worked OK, but this one will need to be returned."
1,"FIRST I GOT A MESSAGE THAT THIS ITEM WAS BEING RETURNED, DAMAGED IN MAIL. THEN I REORDERED. IT LASTED MAYBE 2 WEEKS AND STOPPED WORKING. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!"
1,Buttons stopped working after 2 months
1,If I could go don’t zero stars I would. Lagged regardless of settings and eventually stopped working completely after Less than a week.
1,Arrived broken - cheap piece of plastic junk.
1,"From the moment I began using the mouse, it was glitchy. I would be using the mouse and it would appear clear across the screen. Very annoying. I replaced the batteries several times and it made no difference. It is slow to start as well. I purchased it because of the quiet click feature, which it does well, but the way the mouse misbehaves constantly makes me so frustrated. Would not recommend at all."
1,Bought for my daughter and she hated it so much I had to buy her another one. She said it doesn't feel like your clicking and broke literally after a few days of receiving it 😤
1,Really bad product don’t work!!
1,"I liked the mouse while it worked, it’s compact and simple to connect. But after only a couple of months it stopped connecting to my computer. I tried changing the battery and that did not help."
1,"This mouse is such a waste of money. It broke two hours after usage, even when I followed instructions and used gently. It suddenly just stopped worked."
1,"This mouse stopped working correctly, wandering on the screen such that you have to wrestle with it"
1,"This product seemed fine at first but stopped working after two months of use. I have changed the batteries, re-paired. No light, no response. It also makes a rattling noise as if something internal came loose."
1,This mouse stopped functioning properly after a few weeks. Would not recommend.
1,Right click broke on day 2
1,So disappointed in this mouse . This mouse worked for about a month and hasn't worked since. Do not purchase.
1,Broke after 2ises
1,"My mouse stopped functioning and I needed it pretty quickly.. Next day delivery. All stars on that My local Staples was out. This was intended to be a stop gap. It didn't last a month. Unfortunately, it fell on the floor and rendered the left button. useless. Not good. There was also no way to shut off the device. Would I recommend?  No.Spend a little more money and get one that will last."
1,I was very disappointed the item did not work
1,Received in December and already stopped working
1,I don't like this mouse it jumps a lot when I'm trying to use it.
1,I would not recommend as this unit stopped working with my laptop. It started with random movements when the mouse was not being touched then would not hover over the item I needed to click. Then completely stopped working for me even with fresh batteries.
1,"This mouse is really small so it's kind of awkward to use if you have bigger hands. It's also very jumpy and it doesn't matter what surface you use, it has a mind of its own. Don't waste your time."
1,I’ve had a lot of mice over the years and this is the worse. Now it could be defective but I’m not sure. The sensor jumps around and is impossible to use.  DO NOT BUY
1,"I don’t like it. When I first got it, it worked but now it doesn’t."
1,I bought two of these and each time the died on me. I changed the battery but it would not connect to my computer. The second time lasted shorter than the first.
1,i bought this in feb and it already isn't working. the battery doesn't want to connect when you put the lid on and when you try and use it without the lid it doesn't function. feels chincy and cheep.
1,"The mouse was bought in April, and already broke in May."
1,After the first few months stopped working
1,Mouse never worked easily. Lightweight with very unstable batter compartment. Didn't last 6 months!
1,Its already not working. Thanks.
1,"Mouse is not turning on. I tried plugging in the usb and inserting a fresh battery, tried different brand batteries, restarted computer, the mouse just isn't turning on, or lighting up. Horrible. Don't get it"
1,It was broke when I opened the package. Highly dissatisfied.
1,Garbage.  Died in under 5 months with normal use.
1,"Broke in 2 when I got. Didnt want the hassle of returning it, besides only get half of the money back anyways"
1,Didn’t last long. Just stopped working
1,Mouse wobbles and sakes on screen. Not smooth. Have to slam it to wake it up. Not a fan.
1,This thing is so cheap and feels like it. Spend a couple extra bucks and get yourself something decent. Feels like a fat ball and uncomfortable for small hands. Puts wrist at bad angle again for small hands.
1,Purchased the mouse for my wife for mother's day.  Price was good but the mouse works very poorly.  Cursor will not move smoothly (tried different surfaces and adjustments on the chromebook).  Cannot recommend.  Would return it but I bought it too long ago.
1,"First, I don't usually write reviews, however this mouse is so crappy I had to make sure no one else wastes their money on it.  This mouse is just bad, and here's the reasons why.1. It feels extremely flimsy, I understand it's a budget mouse, but it shouldn't feel like it's it going to break when I hold it. Also the clicking action on the buttons is too flexible, making it feel like simple clicks will also break it.2. The sleep mode absolutely sucks. Apparently it has a sleep function but it's more annoying than anything because it sleeps after a few moments which makes the mouse difficult to use. Stop sleeping when I don't want! Just add an on and off button next time instead of being cheap.3. It broke within 3 months perfectly right after the Amazon return window ended. This mouse suddenly stopped tracking out of nowhere. I've tried new batteries, cleaning the optical lens, and changing the USB ports. Nothing works.Basically, avoid this product. Go buy a slightly more expensive mouse or from a different company. Don't even try to use this mouse for gaming, because of the problem I listed above it will just frustrate you while playing. If you game, you need reliable hardware and this mouse isnt reliable at all. I'mma pass, thanks for wasting my time and money."
1,"I tried to use this on both an HP laptop and a MacBook Pro and using different surfaces, including a very nice mouse pad. The tracking is TERRIBLE. If you want to get frustrated wondering where your cursor is going to go next, by all means waste your money and good luck every time you try to click any button or highlight any text. If you want your cursor to go where expected and not drift away like some kind of unsecured glass eye, get something else."
1,This mouse is hard to control.  It skips around and makes it difficult to select text.  It jumps from one location to another and at times won't move at all.  I've  become so frustrated I threw it away.  If you need to copy and paste or highlight individual letters within text you will lose  your mind.
1,Don't waste your money on this one. It is low quality. It's broken after less than one month.
1,A very bad one. You have to push it all the time for it to work. Hate it. It doesn't worth even a dollar.
1,Six months and it stopped working
1,Just used three months. It’s broken
1,Doesn’t work very well
1,It broke 3 days after I got it. Tried to contact the company and still no answer.
1,"I bought a bunch of colors because we have kids and a bunch of device.  These simply are crap.  I changed batteries, devices, mouse pads and device types...  They connect intermittently, they have a tendency to drift lower right when not in use.  I even tried one and the rest without batteries in case the frequencies were too close.  Complete and udder waste of money"
1,I purchased mine in January. At the end of April it stopped working. The light flashes when I replace the battery but then there is no feedback to the computer. It was a great mouse while it worked. Very quiet. I am disappointed that it stopped.
1,"When I put the USB the mouse did not work. I put a new battery in and checked the Bluetooth settings and it would not connect. Also, this mouse came up at a keyboard so I am not sure what the issue was with it. All in all... I was not able to use this mouse at all."
1,"have this for a week. curser jumps around without moving the mouse, and then stop working"
1,Ordered this Friday and it already does not work. Button does not point and click and is not even useful as a paperweight. Spend the extra money for something better made instead of donating $9 for a piece of useless garbage.
1,"Soo disappointed i just got my mouse and it dosen't work. The USB seems to not work, the mouse turns on, but it doesn't work"
1,never did work !!!  cheaply made and cover has 1/8 inch gap ?  will not close all the way ?  tried several ports on several computers and never worked at allwould never recommend this item to anyone
1,"Very cheap, broke less than a month after I got it"
1,I bought this less than 2 months ago and it already stopped working.  I put brand new battery in it and the light went on for 3 seconds and then died.
1,Stopped working correctly a month after return window closed.
1,I dislike the precise essence of this mouse or lack there of. If you buy it be prepared to use a mouse pad.
1,It didn't last very long and difficult toget it to work.
1,Sent the wrong color
1,Stopped working after 2 months.
1,Bite the bullet and buy a better one. I've had this mouse a little over a month and it's terrible. I didn't realize how REALLY bad it is until I used my husbands computer and mouse. It wasn't all that great to begin with but it's even worse now.
1,"It's beautiful, it's quiet, it's perfect... at first.We loved this mouse, but now it's terrible. It won't hold the click if you try to drag and drop. If you hold the mouse button down, it releases the hold before you actually let go."
1,This mouse pad horrible response. I’ve never had a mouse that was so worthless. I sent it back. Maybe I just got a bad one. Either way they should’ve done some quality control
1,Does not come with the sub receiver it needs :( ordered twice bc I thought I accidentally threw it out
1,"Very hard to use, I have given up and it’s in my junk box now."
1,"Hardly works, doesn't ""sense"" what its on. REGRET. Spend the extra couple dollars."
1,"This mouse absolutely sucks!  Instead of an on/off feature, it idles.  So when you need to use it, you have to wait until it reactivates, which if you're using it for work, is extremely inconvenient.  Once it does activate, it's not very responsive - It may or may not slide to the target.  This was a waste of money.  Do NOT buy."
1,"NO thanks, I found this mouse not only did it waste batteries so freakin fast. But it would move around on its own if I was trying to go right it was sliding up slightly it made graphic designing difficult and it made working in general very hard on my laptop.Yes I did change the sentiivity many times to try and fix the problem but it just wasn't worth the money"
1,It was great for 3 months until it stopped working now in April. Unfortunately I'm past the date of return so that also sucks.
1,"Unfortunately, the failure occurred AFTER the window closed to return it. I'll have to look for another one that hopefully will work for a while."
1,I left my good mouse at home and needed one for an extended trip. I did not want to spend very much as it was temporary. It is pretty but very frustrating to use. I have to touch the light on the bottom to get it to turn on. It is all over the place when using it and sometimes it absolutely will not click on the line you want it to click on. I gave it a one-star for sleep mode because it seems to prefer to sleep! Won't forget my good mouse next trip!
1,Nothing to like. Could not tell if it blocked blue light at all.  Broke within the first week of using them
1,These things made my eyes hurt bad
1,"The glasses only block uv light not blue light.  These glasses do keep the test strip from  changing color when you shine the blue colored light on it, but that is because the light is a uv (or black) light and the test strip is uv sensitive ink.  The test strip turned dark when I put it in sun light, which includes uv light, but did not turn dark when I held it up to my phone or light bulbs which only put out visible light."
1,Do not recommend these glasses as they are not blue light blockers and I returned them.
1,"After months of wearing I realized they were just plastic when compared to another blue light brand, unfortunate!"
1,"Waste of money, do not buy"
1,"I've worn glasses for 28+ years and recently got Lasik.  I wanted these because I work on a computer all day but they are very cheaply made and very uncomfortable.  I'll be going back to my eye doctor to just get a real pair of glasses without prescription but with the Crizal blue light blocking.  More expensive but well worth it to wear them for 8+ hours a day, 5+ days a week."
1,The lenses on these do not help with blue light blocking. You are pretty much buying them for the frames.
1,"I got a 2 pack for $9 on sale. Even that is too much to pay for these. The worst thing is the fact that they reflect on the inside. I can literally see my own eyeballs and it gives me a massive headache, worse than the eye strain. They also smudge worse than any pair of glasses or sunglasses I've ever seen. Don't waste your money on these. Try a $30-$50 pair from a known/trusted brand instead.  If you are on a budget and can't afford a good pair, I'd save up until you can because these are so bad I wouldn't even give these away to my worst coworker."
1,Disappointing
1,Absolutely awful.
1,These don't work at all.I wasn't able to even return them or talk to someone about them.Completely fake and a shame that it has a high ratingDO NOT BUY
1,A complete scam. Don’t block blue light at all.
1,Not worthy
1,Both of them broke - one within a month and the other a few months later. Very cheap materials
1,"I had to return these. As soon as I put them on (tried both pairs, same reaction) I smelled some sort of chemical, my eyes burned so bad and began to water and I got a headache almost immediately. This was late afternoon. I tried them again the next morning before using my laptop or phone and had the same reaction. So, these are not for me. And that's sad because I absolutely love the style and the fit. I also couldn't test them with the provided light and test card because the light wouldn't take on. Maybe I got a bad pair of glasses and a bad test light. The reaction was so intense that I won't try another pair :(."
1,"Waste of money, tight and rough on nose.I dont felt any different."
1,Cheap plastic toy glasses. Pretty sure all the reviews are from people being paid to put 5 stars. Don’t wast your money. Make absolutely no difference while staring at the screen. Cheap but not worth it. Glare right off of computer causing more eye strain
1,they smudge easily and are very fragile. poor quality
1,One Lil smudge and never clean again
1,I have 20/20 vision so the added magnification put on these lenses actually make my eyes hurt and gives me migraines. I think they would do a phenomenal job if there was no additional magnification.
1,"Don't buy, they do nothing lol"
1,These made absolutely no difference.
1,They don’t block  blue light... they block UV. So they are basically non tinted sunglasses.
1,Very disappointed that these came to me used. Dirty fingerprints and makeup on both glasses and one of the bags ripped. Just gross!  Where is the quality check?
1,"I was exited for these. But after a few hours of use. My nose started to hurt, and i got bruises on my nose. I had to stop using them. The glasses are too heavy for me."
1,Tint not very strong when compared to colleagues that had other branded computer glasses.
1,"Both pairs broke within a few weeks. Experienced optician who knows what hes doing, i couldn’t adjust them without the temples snapping. Blue light coating is simply a yellow tint, no antireflective qualities. Avoid this."
1,Does not help at all with eye strain while working on computer
1,Doesn’t work and I developed a rash using it on my face. I see no difference when I flash the blue light on the lens.
1,"Meh, seemed to have a slight prescription so o couldn’t wear them. Gave to my kids to wear since they stare at screens all day"
1,Both the black and clear glasses showed up missing a little silver piece. Not worth the money!
1,"Bought this 2 pack with horrible fake advertisement and they are just cheap clear plastic lenses. Do not buy if you are looking to block blue light, these don’t block any whatsoever."
1,Never even got to wear. Both broke.
1,"Sending back, does not fit my face. Sits too high on my nose! Does the job advertised."
1,I'm sure they do the job but these are 100% glasses for women. Advertise it as such. The minute I opened the box I said oh hell no.....
1,"Terrible quality!! Don't waste your money. These are just awful. They look smeared no matter how many times you clean them with microfiber. They may or may not protect against blue light, but they make vision bad enough to make you dizzy."
1,Just returned from eye doctor and these glasses have done nothing to help me from harmful blue light. In fact it appears that do not have any blue light filtering.
1,No blue glare on the lenses. Possibly false advertising
1,"They don't seem to block the blue light and after wearing them for 5 minutes, my eyes started hurting really bad."
1,Ummm super cute but no blue light blocking
1,These things aren’t worth a penny
1,"I am not sure why but these made me extremely dizzy, couldnt use them"
1,Meh.............
1,Although these were cute shaped frames.They didn’t do anything as described.It was disappointing since I’m on a laptop everyday.
1,didnt like how after 5 min of me having them on my eyes started to hurt and water
1,"I don’t think these work at all. Even when I have myPhone on lowest light setting, I still have trouble sleeping. It’s the same effect with or without the glasses  Also the plastic is a very cheap grade (high sound) instead of a more solid and pliable plastic."
1,Cute but not very effective
1,Not what I was looking for Not worth my money
1,These don’t work at all. Blue light goes right thru it! Waste of money.
1,"These glasses are a scam.  They distort vision, I have purchased several pairs of blue light blocking glasses and have never had a problem with vision distortion.  These are awful"
1,These glasses are not optically correct. They distort your vision.  I do not recommend buying or using these glasses.
1,They broke 5 days after buying
1,These are horrible. They broke with in hours and aren’t even blue blocking at all.
1,Not pleased.
1,There was absolutely no difference in these glasses than a pair of non prescription glasses that you can get from Claire’s at the mall. My neighbor bought a different brand and they work. I’ll be getting the link for those instead.
1,The other pairs of blue light glasses I own will darken the appearance of blue and blue-tinted objects when they are viewed through the lens (blue objects appear black and blue-tinted objects have their blue component removed). These lenses do not do that. Viewing a color spectrum through them results in no visible changes.
1,Didnt help with screen protection
1,These seem to be nothing but clear lenses — no difference whatsoever.
1,"not very comfortable, does not really do anything."
1,It doesn't actually block or reflect blue light electronic screens... They do provide UV protection if you want to wear them for outdoors. The test kit that comes with it is fake. Confirmed this with my eye doctor.
1,The glasses were not the magnification that I ordered.
1,The glasses were stolen bye a stranger
1,Bad quality
1,Trash! Don't protect eyes. These are fashion glasses.
1,I didn't see any difference and have stopped trying to use them.
1,Horrible. Did not help my eye strain at all
1,They’re cute but too big for my face. I had toReturn them.. unfortunately.
1,Not goodMakes me feel dizzy
1,I see no big difference!
1,These glasses seem to have a foggy finish on them so nothing is clear. It's like looking through dirty glasses.
1,"I purchased these glasses and thought I was protecting my eyes. NOPE!!!! My technology teacher noticed that everyone's glasses online actually have a blue reflective tint but mine did not. Once I purchased a pair from another vendor (not online), I too have the blue tint and my eyes feel different after wearing my new ones for just two days. I can tell the difference. Unfortunately, I cannot return these because it's past the return date. It's so risky to purchase online."
1,"I normally do not leave reviews however, these glasses are a bit of the safety hazard. Unfortunately, the livho 2 Pack Blue Light Blocking glasses are very poorly made. While wearing the black pair of glasses, one of the legs broke while still on my face."
1,Purchased and they broke within two weeks of wearing. 😩
1,"Unfortunately it was a waste of money for me.  They didn't help at all, but I wanted to at least give it a try."
1,I thought they were reader’s. They served no purpose
1,The lens are  not very clear!
1,This is a terrible product. They do not work and I am mad that I ever ordered from this company. Save your money and find glasses that actually block the blue light.
1,"I’m ok with these glasses being so cheep as I got them on sale, however they absolutely don’t work. They actually made the computer screen blurry. I tried them with my laptop, tablet, and phone and no distance or angle it solves the problem."
1,Did not help when using for computer
1,"These caused bad headaches for me. After cleaning several times, they were still pretty blurry. I'm not sure if that's the effect of filtering blue light, but I wasn't expecting that. I wasn't expecting much for the price, but I cannot wear these. I had to search for other reviews that mentioned the headaches and blurry lenses, so it's not common. I wish I noticed those reviews before the purchase."
1,Not well constructed cheap.
1,"I have antiglare, blue light blocking glasses and they work wonders. Both sets of these did none of that.  It’s like the lens has no purpose."
1,"No is no effect on them, So I didn't like them, and it was a waste of money."
1,Poor quality and not blue light effective at all. Do not recommend
1,Poor quality. Frame broke after using it three times.
1,The light blocking really didn’t seem to work
1,These are so blurry! I cannot see through them at all. Total waste of money.
1,Not impressed
1,There was absolutely NO blue light blocking in these glasses... waste of money. Look elsewhere for actual blue light glasses.
1,Couldn’t tell a difference at all. Not worth it
1,"Just a couple of month with it, and some letters stop working. I tried reinstall the driver but its impossible to find the driver of this keyboard online. Now I need to buy another keyboard... Very bad experience, you will have a keyboard just for a couple of months."
1,"Keyboard came entirely non-functional--after being plugged in, it shows no signs of life, input doesn't function, lights don't turn on, etc. The mouse works as described, though."
1,This was teh worst purchase i ever made for my sons computer. What a waste of money. Its hot chinese plastic garbage. The mouse stopped working about a week after. The springs were already broken. Never again anything red dragon.
1,After less than 6 months of use this keyboard is all but dead. Half the keys don't work but then sometimes they will unexpectedly and it will respond like I pressed it 50 times.
1,Multiple keys stopped working within a month. Total trash.
1,This product was defective. Keys kept sticking
1,Very disappointed with this purchase;  Shift key don't work most of the time and Enter key either don't work at all or get stuck.
1,This broke in the first few weeks do not buy.
1,Within 6 months I had keys sticking & the mouse would randomly stop working while gaming.
1,"Terrible mushy keys.  Actually even worse than the ""essentially free with Fry's Friday sale and rebate"" HP keyboard I've been using and had hoped it would replace.Plus the wrist rest with it's annoying textured surface isn't even removable."
1,The keyboard worked gret for about 2 hrs. The enter key stopped working along with the whole numerical pad. This is trash with no return option. Ill be better off getting a used unit from a thrift store. If you dont want to waste money dont buy this.
1,"After one year, the middle mouse button just stopped working. Dont buy this crap."
1,"the keys are farther apart than normal so the lights can shine through better and you often find yourself having to look at each key which any gamer will tell you is not a good thing , maybe it will be less of a pain in time but i doubt it. if your used to wide gaps between keys or simply are fine with frequently hitting the wrong key when typing or gaming it will do just fine as quality seems good this one will end up in my spare equipment once my new logitech arrives as an emergency backup"
1,its a keyboard  really thought it be wireless the lights starts flashing absurdlety and vioently as soon as you plug it in leaving you need to adjust it in the chaos light is too bright
1,PIECE OF TRASH FLASHES EVRY TIME YOU USE IT SO YOU HAVE TO KEEP TURNING OFF THE STUPID FLASHING LIGHTS EVRYTIME YOU USE YOUR COMPUTER
1,"Bad Shelf Life, All lights and RGB worked but keyboard didn’t type even though it showed that it was on, horrible"
1,the keyboard and mouse were decent but the space key was REALLY springy and sounds terrible
1,"the keyboard when it wants to work, the primary enter key does not work. the color change effect keeps resetting. the USB connectors are large enough to make using other USB ports difficult. the worst keyboard I've ever bought. the mouse works fine."
1,Half the keys do not work on keyboard. Very disappointed!
1,"The keyboard tries, but the K and P keys do not work at all for me brand new out of the box. Completely useless keyboard.Be warned if you're buying this. Test ALL of the keys and be prepared to return."
1,"keyboard junk, spring in keyswitch not strong, bounce the keyboard and get an output. or spurious keystrokes occurring without human input. it will type stuff by itself."
1,Keys wore off after a month of normal use.  Mouse stopped functioning
1,"Keyboard died on me. I’m very gentle with it, never let it get dirty or harmed and it just quit working."
1,stopped working after 5 months PIECE OF GARBAGE
1,"The keyboard and mouse work ok. But if you want ANY information on the mouse you have to go to the website and download software. None of my antivirus and antimalware will let me go to the site. When I give it permission Chrome forces you to add an extension to the browser without explanation as to why. Why should I have to add an extension to my web browser simply to go to their site and download the software I need to make the lights stop blinking on the mouse? I can't even tell if they are supposed to blink. If they blink due to low batteries, and if so where the hell do the batteries go? There's literally nothing in the ""manual"" that explains anything about the mouse.Take some time Redragon to put information about both products in the manual. I have spent too much time trying to figure out a mouse and the stupid lights blinking on it. Plug-n-play? Please...."
1,Do Not buy.  No customer serviceThey ignore your email for supportEmailed time more than a couple of times for mouse that stopped working. NO REPLY
1,Only worked for 4 months. Emailed manufacturer with no response.
1,"one of the buttons from the mouse stopped working after the 4th month, and couldn't get a replacement. Very bad customer support, didn't answer my questions yet."
1,This version is Cheaply made never will use the sorry mouse in gaming ever again
1,My mouse broke after a 2 months and I contacted the seller and they didn’t nothing about it. They didn’t bother to respond. The keyboard is still fine but the mouse doesn’t work. They have terrible customer service. Don’t recommend this product.
1,"I bought this for my son a month before his  b-day, after his started using it the asdf keys are intermittently working.  For gaming that's not good, now my window for a replacement has passed so I'm out of a keyboard.  The mouse is working fine but the keyboard is having issues.  We are using this on a new MSI laptop so I doubt it's the laptop.  I would suggest looking else where for a keyboard/mouse combo."
1,Didn't last 6 months now keys are flaking out and dead ish.  Never again.
1,Stopped working after 10 days.
1,"The base to hold the monitor does not accept the screws that were provided. The two screws to be inserted at the bottom do not insert all of the way. The third screw that actually goes into and holds the monitor is fine, but the other two do not screw in all of the way. This is causing the base to be unstable and for me to not be able to install the safety protector because the screws stick out too much. Very disappointing as I now need to go to a store to find smaller screws, or have them drill in larger holes for the base."
1,Left shift key doesn't work.  I believe too late to exchange. Very dissatisfied!!
1,"Terrible experience overall. This keyboard will type numbers and random things constantly and is unusable after a month. I can't game, write, or do anything without random characters and numbers getting inserted.Have tried contacting their customer support and haven't heard anything back.BUY A DIFFERENT KEYBOARD FROM A DIFFERENT COMPANY."
1,"I bought this for the keyboard and it looks really good and feels pretty solid. But, it start auto scrolling web pages and documents, and buttons stop working. The first time the enter key stopped working I was able to unplug it and plug it back in, and it started working again. The next time that didn't work, so I left it unplugged and hooked my old keyboard back up."
1,Just got it in the mail today. The mouse came misaligned and the left and right mouse buttons don’t work. The keyboard is awesome but the mouse was a disappointment
1,Not much more to say than that. Backspace and Enter no longer function consistently -- sometimes not at all and other times with multiple inputs per keypress.Now to find out how the warranty works out.
1,"First time using it, the 0 key wouldn't work. I though, ok it might be a problem with my driver. Updated my driver, still had the same issue. This was before I got my new PC. I get my new PC, new monitor and everything. Same problem. I decided to just use the number pad and deal with the issue. Not even a few weeks later. The 0 key keeps spamming if I press it, and every once in a while the whole keyboard glitches out and spams the 0 key if I even press a key near it. I glide my finger over the p key then all of a sudden it starts spamming 0. I've only had it for 2 months.."
1,"Got one and was defected, got a new one also defected and then got a third one and it's defected I give up. Plastic junk"
1,Didn’t work right out the box and soon after my pc started turning on and off repeatedly by itself. Idk if that issue is unrelated or not but it’s definitely getting a 1 star for not even working out of the box. And i will be returning this product
1,I bought the keyboard 3 months ago and now 3 keys stopped working. I don't play games or nor I have a habit of hitting hard still after a very light use three major keys stopped working..
1,The keys would get stuck and would not work. Returned item
1,"Defective, returned within 2 days"
1,"I've only had this keyboard for a couple of months but it's completely broken on me! the keyboard is completely broken! every time I try and type something only a select few keys work SOME OF THE TIME!! I really enjoyed it for the short time I had it though... The mouse still works though, and I like it."
1,shift and enter keys don't work half the time.. I really should return it!!!! Not a good purchase.
1,"Had to return it as it is wired, hate wired devices!"
1,The keyboard out of the box worked . However the mouse which I really wanted was DOA
1,Product worked well for the first day and then the mouse stopped working. Customer service is dodgy and wants me to pay for shipping to return it but they will “reimburse” me because their “stamps system is having trouble”.
1,"I just got this combo and while I don't use the mouse I had hopes that the keyboard would work well for what I needed it for.Unfortunately it kind of just does what it wants to and there seems to be no fix for it. Literally has been a pain since day 1.Very disappointed. Already switched back to my older, reliable keyboard."
1,Not a great keyboard at all. Half the keys didn’t work
1,"Ordered in January and as of today (4/6/2021) I could not shift any character with the left had Shift. I didn't even game with this but used it as a normal keyboard for business work. Furthermore, more keys stopped working. Tried a different USB port and rebooted on that port with no effect. The return policy says to contact the seller, but I cannot find it on the page anywhere. One point to consider. It has great reviews and a great many of them which is the criteria that swayed me. BUT BEFORE YOU BUY THIS, do a search for 'return' and that is where you get to see all the really bad reviews.  Before you waste your money....just pass on by."
1,Product came defective shift s didn’t work dash key would spam by hovering over it
1,the keyboard itself is a nice build but every time i try to type for some reason it puts a dot (.) at the end for example “h.i. m.y. n.a.m.e .is ba.m” and for gaming hell no somtimes the keys dont work but the mouse its ok
1,"The drivers for the product are not that easy to find, mine never worked. I would never order a product from them ever even it it was 10 dollars. Spend your time and to your research."
1,"Wouldn't purchase ever again. Bought for my sons online school alits not even 1 year and got "" Black Screen"" and from google look like an issue that is a norm. I cannot resend because I ordered through a skybox so I have to get fixed on my end. Seriously disappointed."
1,"The LCD hinge was broken after 3 month. Contacted the seller, no warranty!"
1,"I bought this laptop in June of 2020 and, initially, was fairly pleased. Several months ago, however, the device ignored my instructions not update Windows 10, auto-updated in the middle of the night, and has been unable to make it past the startup screen ever since. Um not even able to reset the device after booting in safe mode- everything results in a similar error. Since it's no longer covered under warranty, Acer is of zero assistance. My only option is to buy a new copy of Windows 10, or buy a new laptop altogether."
1,Screen stopped working 10 days after purchasing
1,I faced several issues with this PC in spite on light usage. First google meet does not work on all browsers and suddenly mutes the conversation. We spent ages trying to solve this problem until we discovered that it works only on microsoft edge.Sound quality is not clear and low.Finally the battery stopped charging and the laptop does not work except when it is plugged in power. All of this happened after less than 8 months of usage.A total waste of money
1,"An average laptop that has extremely dumb audio system. Screen resolution doesn't feel like it is 1020 full HD. Bit pricey and not worth the money. Performance is decent with the AMD Ryzen processor. Feels like I am carrying a huge, heavy brick. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. 👎"
1,Although affordable price. Laptop has disappointed me. The mousepad stoped working within a month and now less than a year after purchase it will not hold any charge. Battery appears to have gone bad. Don’t waste your money on this laptop.
1,I only tried this laptop two or three times.  The keyboard was so stiff it hurt to use it.  I returned it.
1,"THE WORST EVER RESPONSE FROM ACER CUSTOMER SERVICE FOR DEFECTIVE LAPTOP.THAT MAN WOULDN'T EVEN LISTEN TO THE PROBLEM. ALSO, THEY GIVE YOU CONTACT PHONE THAT supposes TO WORK 24x7. NOBODY EVEN ANSWERED . HOPE THE AMAZONE WOULD STAY AWAY FROM ACER PRODUCTS"
1,The battery died after a week and the screen started blinking. I needed to connect an external monitor to work. BAD BAD BAD.
1,"I am attempting to get ahold of the seller.  This laptop is terrible.  It has failed three times now. It is fully charged, but will not turn on.  I have tried hard restarts, the whole nine hards.  I bought it in April. It's July. I'm so sorry I wasted money on this thing.  Do not buy."
1,"the display is supposed to be 1080x1920, but everything on the screen appears pixelated. Also this laptop is so slow it can't load basic webpages. It lags when all I'm doing is trying to shop on amazon, with nothing else running in the background. It doesn't meet the specs it claims to and I think it is a scam. I have a 7 year old laptop from walmart I bought for $300 that can handle web browsing better than this. It reminds me of loading jpgs with dial up internet. I also dislike the track pad because it's oversized and I often left click when I'm trying to right click, and I also sometimes accidentally click and drag webpages off the pages because my resting thumb on the space bar ""clicks"" the very top edge of the pad. It's difficult to explain but I end up with a lot of mis clicks and accidentally closing tabs I didn't intend to. I don't recommend this laptop under any circumstance. It's pretty, but not functional and lower quality than the given specs."
1,I am sick and tired of this computer. Adobe CC asks to be repaired every day. I just had to fix Word. I had to delete and replace Chrome all within the last 48 hours.  I want my computer to function without these kinds of problems.
1,We have two broken computers that Acer will not support.
1,"I know a lot of people love this computer, and I'm sure it's great for them.I couldn't even get thru setup without wanting to throw it away.  Keyboard takes up the whole top but the right side is a number pad (which 90% never user and doesn't do anything unless you turn on numlock) which means that the rest of the keyboard is squished.  My 13"" computer keyboard is wider than this one.I couldn't type to save my life, I messed up everything because the spacing is off.  It would take me longer to use this computer to do anything, just because I'd be fighting the keyboard and then be messed up when I go back to another keyboard to use my other computers.Btw, you must create or have a ms acct to set up this computer. I bought this just to use as an extra pc for a specific task and I miss when you could turn on a computer and just have it work. I truly believe that this should be banned. It's a privacy issue.If this will be your only PC, it might be fine, but for me, just not a fit that I can force myself to use."
1,"You get what you pay for, this computer regularly disconnects from our internet service, and has to be shut completely down to get reconnected.  It also regularly just ""encountered a problem and needs to restart"", losing all current data of course."
1,"The labtop work fine but does have a small overheating issue but nothing expected ,but cannot recommend this labtop which has some serious durability issues mainly around the hinges. Maybe I opened and closed it to much but this labtop lasted me around nine month and my two year plan with asurion speaks that nothing can be done. So buy at your own peril"
1,"Speaker stopped working after 6 mos.  Periodically drops wifi every day, despite reinstalling drivers, now my touchpad will not work.  I wish I had never purchased this piece of junk."
1,"Acer Aspire 5 Slim Laptop 15.6 inches Full HD computer stop working this month July 2021.  I purchase this item in October 2020 as a Christmas gift for my grandson.  Unfortunately, the computer has stop working and the battery will not charge.  Please contact me in reference to the warranty information.  I would not purchase another computer through AMAZON.  No customer service support when needed."
1,Died after a year and few months of use.
1,Never got to turn it on...but still paying for😵😵😵
1,Horribly horrible computer! Do not buy! Screen went out in less than a week! Only used it once or twice before it went to H E double hockey sticks to
1,This laptop came with a scam. Had to send it back!
1,I’m very annoyed. Bought this laptop on prime day. I used it once and already had to factory reset. I tried all of the trouble shooting trick none of which worked. Computer would not go past the sign in.
1,"I received this computer already slightly damaged. There was a crack next to the port for the charger cable. Over time that crack deepened diagonally and moved to the screen making the charging area unstable. Additionally, the charger didn't work and I had to order another one. Now the compter is generally having issues with the charging area. If not for this, I'd say the computer works fairly ok but the charging issue is untenable."
1,Stopped working after 4 months of light use.
1,The product arrived with a bad wireless card. I returned the item and the refund was applied to a Amazon gift card instead of my credit card. I am not happy.
1,"This computer worked well for the first three months after purchase, then the display/screen stopped functioning; the laptop still functioned when an external monitor was plugged in. I used the Amazon-facilitated Acer warranty hotline to arrange to have the laptop repaired at the Texas facility, but after Acer received the broken laptop, Acer claimed the display was 'cracked' (which was not evident to the naked eye) and thus this component was not covered by their 1 year warranty. The repair estimate was $258 (I purchased the laptop new for $350!)---not worth fixing. Shame on Acer for not backing up what you sell, even if this is a budget product. I won't be buying from this brand again."
1,Laptop over heated a few weeks after using along with the battery pack! Felt like it could burn you while touching it.  Would continuously freeze up forcing me to manually shut down.No legacy option in bios!  This causes additional problems.  No memory card optionLaptop seemed to be well made at first (in order to fool you)Turned out to be junk!  ( i should have known better with that price)AND ONLY HALF OF MY MONEY WAS REFUNDED!  AND IT TOOK A MONTH TO EVEN GET THAT.  WHERE IS THE OTHER FEW HUNDRED AT AMAZON?!AMAZON CUSTOMER SERVICE NO HELP AT ALL.  FAIL.  MY NEXT 400 PURCHASESWILL DEFINITELY BE ON EBAY OR ANY OTHER BUSINESS AT ALL BEFORE AMAZON.You have been warned!!!  RUN AWAY!
1,"I purchased this computer for personal use.  At approximately six weeks into use, the screen went totally blank while the motherboard still lit up.  The folks at the geek squad were able to boot up the computer to an external screen, indicating the screen on the laptop was defective.  After multiple calls to amazon, they were finally able to issue a refund minus a substantial ""restocking fee"".I have emailed/contacted the manufacturer no less than 3 times without response.  Nothing but disappointment and loss of funds spent on this computer.  Even though ACER is a ""name brand"", their customer service is non-existent and I would avoid them at all costs."
1,"I had this laptop for 3 months before trouble started with wifi adapter. About 6 months after purchase a line showed up on the screen permanently! I have never taken it out of my room or out and about, and have been very very careful with it as I seen it as an investment. I feel so ripped off!!!"
1,"Barely had it 2 months and it is a complete mess. Doesn't open up for a long time, grey screen, missing screen items you name it. Horrible computer, help desk is impossible. I was under the impression I could return it within 3 months. Your help dept. was useless."
1,The laptop charger didn't last 6 months before it broke n never worked again i originally had a good review but with out a charger couldn't use my laptop for days and that's very inconvenient.
1,"I can't even imagine how this POS even left the factory, after QC, considering you have to login to your Microsoft account to even install any third party applications on it. Who in their right mind would only be installing MS applications only?!? I wish I could return it but I sat on it too long and now I can't. Maybe I will bury it in the backyard so it stops collecting data on me...Even worthless as a boat anchor."
1,"Bought one year ago, already falling apart. Lacks durability.  Good for a few months, then you'll need a new one.  The input to the power cord is broken and now the laptop won't charge.  The lever that opens and closes the laptop pulled apart. Stay away.  Terrible quality."
1,Arrived broken does not come on at all... Plugged in or not.
1,"Had this laptop since october. I've only used it it maybe 20 hours or so. The touchpad no longer works, and the keyboard doesnt light up any more. Trying to figure out how to send it back."
1,"It was broken, not working any more after 3 months."
1,Hate the S Mode that forces you to use Microsoft apps from their app store.
1,"Horrible, touch pad stopped working within a month. Tried reinstalling drivers and everything nothing works. Never buy"
1,i bought this in January  14  2021  the screen is wiggle lines all over and can not see screen  i think it should have lasted longer then this  very disappointed  i will never by this brand again i have HP  that has lasted for 5and 6 years
1,"dont waste your money to buy this laptop , it sucks me now !"
1,"My battery is dead. I recharge often, even if I’m not using it. I’ve had issues with blinking orange battery lights (I did the fix, but it’s something that happens often). I tried to use my laptop today (after plugging it in to recharge yesterday) and there is zero battery. Not happy with this laptop."
1,Track pad broke within 1 month of use. Amazon was no help.
1,This is the second Acer laptop that I have had trouble with!!the first one some of the keys on the keyboard stopped working ALONG with the mouse. I’ve had this one for a short period of time and the mouse went out on this one too!! Extremely frustrating!! I am a nursing student and it’s pretty important to have a functional laptop!!!
1,from the beginning i had a problem that could not be resolved.
1,I bought two of them both touch pads stopped working within 3 months and one screen failed after 4 months
1,I would never buy another laptop like this.  It and/or it's window 10 program takes over and its complexity and clutter is frustrating.
1,"I bought this laptop one year ago for home use. While I use it for mostly internet browsing and light gaming, the quality and fragility of this laptop is extremely poor. The laptop is not durable at all and as a precaution, you must NEVER take out the keys from the keyboard for any reason. Secondly, the hinges on the laptop screen are fragile and could snap which can damage the laptop's monitor. Lastly, the monitor is also fragile. Lightly lifting the corner of the laptop can cause the screen to crack which will make this laptop useless."
1,I got this laptop for my boyfriend but he hates it because it's a downgrade from his old one. Windows 10 S prevents him from using the laptop for what he needs it for. Returning.
1,OS was broken
1,"I HAVE ORDERED FOUR ACER LAPTOPS FROM AMAZON IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE BUY A FIFTH ACER LAPTOP, AFTER READING ALL THE POSITIVE REVIEWS ON THIS ONE. THEY WERE WRONG AND VERY MISLEADING. I SHOULD HAVE PAID ATTENTION TO THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS, THEY WERE ACCURATE. THIS ACER LAPTOP WAS THE WORST, SOUND SYSTEM WAS TERRIBLE, YOU CAN BARELY HEAR IT EVEN IF YOU TURN IT UP TO THE MAX, THE MOUSE PAD AND KEYS WERE UNRESPONSIVE, CAN'T ADJUST THE SETTINGS, ETC. I USED IT FOR A TOTAL OF THIRTY MINUTES,..... 30 MINUTES  AFTER I CHARGED IT AND I PUT IT RIGHT BACK  IN THE PACKAGING.  I COULD NOT GET IT OUT OF MY HOUSE FAST ENOUGH.  WITHIN AN HOUR, I CALLED AMAZON FOR RETURN AUTHORIZATION TO PICK UP THE LAPTOP THE FOLLOWING DAY.  I GOT MY FULL REFUND, AMAZON'S EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE SAVED THE DAY.  GREATLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS ACER LAPTOP. BUYER BEWARE."
1,"I had this problem for the first computer right of the bat, I opened the box, set it up, and couldn't even affect the computer mouse without plugging in an external one, which worked fine, after that, i got a refund and a new one, which worked fine at first, till a few months after I got it, the same exact problem popped up, definitely do not recommend unless you already plan to use an external mouse, in which case it would be fine, as it is to me, it is unusable."
1,"Broke within a year. The curser completely disappeared and did not come back, I spend a few hours trying to troubleshoot this and was not able to fix it. Maybe that has more to do with widows 10 but I’m still very disappointed. Also it gets really hot when left on for extended amounts of time."
1,"I bought this laptop for my wife for her job. I wanted something not pricey and just something that worked. I saw the high amount of five star reviews and I read through some of the lower starred reviews and thought, that won't happen to me, BS!!First of all, the computer got shipped quickly and got here undamaged but that is the only good I can say about it. The backlight for the keyboard goes off quickly and you have to press a key to turn it back on instead of moving the mouse and you cannot change it. As you may have read in other reviews, the computer comes with Windows 10 S Mode installed but my product key is not genuine. It says that the digital license is not valid. Because of this it WILL NOT ACTIVATE WINDOWS. Which means I CANNOT TAKE IT OUT OF S MODE. If the computer is in S Mode then you cannot download any apps or programs that you would normally use like Mozilla or VLC or even Chrome. And furthermore, you cannot access the Command Prompt which means you cannot even activate the Windows even if you wanted to.I have contacted Microsoft who told me that they could not do anything and to contact ACER. I contacted ACER and they told me to try one single thing, which I already did and confirmed that it does not work, then told me I had to send in the laptop to the techs which would take another two weeks just to get it back.Sooooooooooooooooo, long story short, it is a never ending loop of disappointment, anger and resentment and a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY. SAVE YOURSELF THE TROUBLE."
1,I am returning this laptop it takes 6 seconds to load a page. Watching movies is painful because it freezes. The touch pad is hard to use. I wouldn’t recommend this laptop. Crappy speakers.
1,We were having a problem getting it started. Poor customer service. Acer was supposed to send a return label. It didn't happen. Won't buy another one.
1,I have had this computer for about a year. It just stopped working this week. The computer has not been used that often and now it is just a black screen. The screen quality was also very poor on this computer. I definitely will not purchase this again.
1,One they did not tell me that there was no CD or Blu-ray drive available on this computer2. They did not tell me that there was no printer set up on this computer
1,Poor poor quality. Just bought this January 2021 and broke down this month April 2021. Called technical support and they don’t replace it or do any active mesures to give you a working lap top in a timely matter. Expect to send it it and will take from 5-10 days for your computer to go through review. If they can’t fix it there there’s still another presses you need to follow. Do not recommend. Waist of money.
1,I had downloaded chrome and a gaming program and I received a low memory message.
1,"Please do NOT purchase this computer. This computer is using Window 10s mode which prevents you from using or doing anything on it that is not in the microsoft app store. So if you have to work using other platforms or apps such as Zoom, etc. You won't be able to. The only way to use this computer without being in ""S Mode"" is to pay another $134 dollars to use the computer like a regular computer. This is really a scam just to take people money and force them to spend more money for a computer that SHOULD work like a computer in the first place. Honestly save yourself the headache, trouble and money and buy a computer that is NOT this one. After experiencing this I wouldn't even bother looking at any computer with Microsoft. I regret buying this computer. I saved my money to use this computer for work and my classes and I can't even use it. I have been so sad because it's sad you get ripped OFF with something that should work like it's intended to. This has been a nightmare for me and very stressful. I basically bought this computer and can't even use it. So basically I still don't have a computer. PLEASE DON'T BUY THIS COMPUTER. I AM WARNING YOU !!!!!!"
1,Used the computer twice and it d stopped working.  Not worth the money.
1,I can't even get past the Wi-Fi setup before it hard crashes and turns itself off!  Maybe the battery needs to be fully charged but its plugged in and shows its drawing power from the plug so what gives?  Crazy disappointed.  Amazon better give me a full refund if I can't get it going.
1,"very cheesy one , keep freezing ,not able open files or photos , not going waste my time to fight that"
1,"I have had this happen before but never in 93 days. The part that attaches the screen to the key board hinge is separating. I have never done anything but close the screen and set this on a table. I am really unhappy about this and won't ever buy another machine from you again. What a piece of junk.What do you do, set a timer so it breaks right after the 90 days? Posh...."
1,"the worst purchase of my life trust and buy and the computer arrived on time the instructions said to turn it on charged to program it after finishing it marked charged disconnect it and turn off connect it and according to let it charge but the charge light only blinked I returned it  to turn it on and disconnect it and it turned off, I made the return claim giving me to the surprise that I had to pay to return for something useless after two weeks of fights with the provider for a prepaid label on it was his fault, not mine, the  I send a week after I arrive, it turns out that he is going to charge me the shipping for something that I repeat did not work and I keep fighting.  so if you are going to buy a computer, do not buy it on Amazon or at least not directly with the sellers"
1,"We got the computer in November. It has been a headache since we got it. The charger stopped working pretty soon after we got it. We have to hold it in place or balance it on a pen to get it to charge and that only work sometimes. It also doesn't connect well to the internet. We can't use it for Zoom or any other video sites. Acer won't let us return the computer since we bought it on Amazon and Amazon won't let us return it since it is out of the ""return window."" It is frustrating to be stuck with this terrible computer."
1,The product is very poor. I really don’t recommend that you buy it. It takes a few days for the kids to take online lessons and there is a problem with the hardware or software. It’s too bad.
1,"When I received this product, there was no Microsoft Windows activation ID and after contacting Acer they said that I should return it because they cannot activate windows without a product key. The laptop was stuck in S mode only."
1,"I new I did not want to keep the laptop in the restricted Windows 10 S Mode - since our company uses Google Drive and Chrome which is not allowed in S Mode (only apps from Windows store).  Researched this prior to purchased and read where it was started there is a very simple, one step process to go to the non-S Mode version of windows. Attempted this using the Microsoft Store as instructed and got an error message. I've now spent 4 hours and counting with all the -solutions- online to this problem and nothing has worked. Searching and doing all the updates, reseting the Microsoft Store.  I suggest that unless you want to be completely locked in to Microsoft Apps - DO NOT BUY THIS LAPTOP.  I do like the physical laptop, with the nice rubber like keys to the keyboard and being backlite - but it's worthless to me in this S Mode.  I'm going to give it a few more hours because my employee really needs to get going with a laptop - but I'm probably going to box it up and return it."
1,"I hate this soooooo much ...... everything is lose in the package ,not care for what so ever ,everything is filthy disgusting and very very disappointed I want to return this embarrassing thing I ordered .and this item is not worth one star ,"
1,Had less than 24 hrs and a line of missing pixels showed up.  Unreal! Especially since it was brand new.  Was returned the next day and bought something else.
1,Mousepad stopped working within the first couple weeks. No exchanges allowed. Long and painful return process.
1,"Computer came with no valid digital certificate or product key for Windows 10.  Listing said Windows 10 in S mode.  Called Acer, they said to call Microsoft they said call Acer.  Called Amazon and they said I would have to purchase Windows 10 separately.  Have never had to do that.  Why would I purchase a computer with no operating system.  Sent it back.  Will go to a computer store to purchase a compute."
1,"This Acer was purchased for basic word processing, browsing, and some streaming--including both personal and work tasks. It turned to an all black screen within a few weeks of use. Many attempts to fix it failed (using tips and tricks from support sites). Acer's customer service had no new ideas and would not help with a return or shipping it for a repair initially. I was told they had a system update and to call back in a couple of days. I did, and got the same story. Called back a few days later, again was put off. I'm still waiting for someone there to support their product or communicate accurately. Given the current situation, I do not plan to purchase from this company in the future."
1,My computer has been broken for a month now.  I was sent a new cord and that didn't work.  Called ACER Customer support last Monday and was told to call back Friday because they are undergoing a software update.  Called again today (Monday) and they said to call back later in the week for the same reason.
1,windows is fake
1,"I am utterly disappointed in this purchase. I bought it to replace my son's old Chromebook. He's had it LESS THAN 3 days and the touchpad stopped working (better this than 3 months down the road, but still...).We have tried every troubleshooting tip we could find and nothing has fixed it. This was our first (and likely our last) Acer computer. I'm sending it back for a replacement.UPDATE: The replacement has the same defective touchpad issue as the first one, though it didn't stop working until day 20 this time. I'm returning it for a complete refund this time. No more Acer's for us. I'll be shopping around for a better laptop."
1,I really dont write reviews but when I do I usually make them for the people this laptop is good when it works but I only used this about 10 times and now it does not charge or turn on pretty much got robbed I'm really disappointed I was really hyped about this product but no durability whatsoever no scratch or anything looks brand new and it's a lemon buyers beware.
1,"I just purchased this new Acer Aspire 5 A515-43-R19L laptop a couple days ago and it has an 'ELAN I2C 'touchpad in it that just doesn't behave like a normal touchpad should behave. The touchpad cursor will suddenly stop moving, and then as long as I'm still rubbing my finger around the cursor will never move again, no matter the pressure applied it remains in one place on the screen. Once I simply lift my finger up and place it back down on the touchpad again, initiating a new cursor session, the cursor will once again start moving.I seem to be able to replicate this touchpad bug more easily by initially applying very light pressure while trying to start to move the cursor, then followed with a little more pressure once it's stuck.In Device Manager the driver is from ELAN , dated 7/12/2019 and the version is 13.6.15.1. The Acer Support technician had me try to uninstall and delete the 'ELAN I2C' driver to simply use the Microsoft standard 'HID-Compliant Mouse' driver, but the touchpad cursor continues to do the same thing even with this standard Windows driver.This erratic behavior with the 'ELAN I2C' touchpad makes an otherwise decent new Acer laptop a serious frustration to try to use. I will likely be returning it, because I don't think there's much else I can do myself to get this buggy touchpad to work correctly."
1,"The laptop was delivered with some sort of protruding touchpad. Not sure if it's a defect or just a trash design. Secondly, after using it for a few days, it suddenly goes into a black screen and I'm still struggling to get it to work.Please avoid this product and if you need to buy, buy with utmost caution."
1,"backlit keyboard is nice, but I hate to have to pay for word processing.  I hate this ""Gortana"" which pops up all the time."
1,I purchased this product with the understanding that the s mode can be undone. I purchased this for Zoom for my Mother and Grandmother so we could video chat. While in s mode you can't use any products other than what you can get in the Microsoft store.We contacted Acer which sent me a thumbdrive to fix the software issue. 10 days later we receive it and restart the laptop after 3 hours of software downloading and setup. Problem still exists. Returned for refund.
1,Bought two of these laptops both died the first week of usage and I have been running around in circles to just get them refunded.
1,This thing is BRAND NEW...it was just manafactured a few months ago and ALL video is out of synch on netflix and prime video. I have spent DAYS of my valuable time ( I am in law school heading into finals) searching the web for answers...getting a hundred different things to try. Call me old-fashioned but WHY should I have to work on a brand new laptop!????? I guess I am going to have to return it..AFTER I bought a hard drive and more RAM...I am SO mad!!! I dont have TIME for this..and what?? HOURS on the phone withb a guy from India who I cant understand!?? And the speakers!? OMG--PURE GARBAGE
1,"To summarize, you get what you pay for. I was not expecting to run into so many problems right when I took this out of the box.1. Immediately I heard something loose inside the laptop that was rolling around when I pulled it out of its packaging.2. The sound is so bad it's like buying a pair of earbuds in the the dollar store. The speakers are also under the laptop which makes it worse for the sound quality.3. Loud fan when it gets a little warm when using.4. Scratching sound quality when using multiple tabs. I had about 5 tabs open and while watching youtube videos I noticed the sound would cut out or make scratching noises when it is trying to process all the programs.5. Customer service from both Acer and Amazon makes it difficult to fix your/my issues. I contacted customer service the same day after I received this laptop and also the day after. After telling them all of my issues they suggested to send it to Acer but it will take around 20 business days to have everything fixed.6. Possible restocking fee. Wanting to return this item, even though I barely used it the first 2 days, customer service told me that I cannot send any pictures or videos of the laptop and they would have to inspect it BEFORE they can tell me whether or not I will be charged a restocking fee. If you don't like being surprised by restocking fees, don't buy this laptop so you won't have to return.7, I was recommended to use a separate speaker to fix the audio problem (basically to spend more money just so I can hear sounds without it sounding like a broken audio file.8. Screen quality is definitely not good. I would give it a 6/10. The color difference when using a decent another laptop or monitor, the difference is super noticeable.9. 4gb of ram will not be enough trust me. You would have to buy another ram if you want this to run better and you're basically forking more money just to make this laptop a little bit more usable.I know this has good reviews but don't be fooled by it. I was swayed when I was going through the reviews but after I got my product, I was highly disappointed. I wish I had spent more money to get a more reliable laptop. This one is not worth the regular price. I would say with the issues and quality of this laptop, the price should be around $250."
1,"The left hinge broke and they refuse to sevice it because they said I am out of my 1 year warranty. It is registered with a March 5th warranty date, but I didn't order it until March 21st. When I look up ""Acer hinge"" online it comes up with multiple forums where customers have had the same issue and got nowhere with Acer customer service. I will never buy a product from this company again."
1,"Bought this computer less than three months ago, the charging port is broken (diagnosis from acer support) but customer service is poor and I’m stuck with a defective product. Stay away from anything acer."
1,I didn’t recommend
1,"This computer worked great for the first 1 1/2 months, then the trackpad gave out and I had to use a mouse. That worked for a little while, but a few months after that it stopped charging and died. I tried other cords, the problem's within the laptop. Unfortunately, this only happened after the return window closed so now I've got 400 less dollars in my pocket and and I'm stuck with a broken laptop."
1,"Right out of the box the laptop did not work.  Laptop turned on but the screen never even flickered.  Several hours of working various ""fixes"" from ACER's and other tech sites did nothing.  After additional research apparently this is a known problem with ACER's.  Won't purchase another ACER again."
1,This is a genuine product review. I purchased this laptop and it was defective. Apparently the digital key attached the the motherboard is invalid so I cannot get a genuine version of Windows 10. I sat on Microsoft Support and Acer Support for HOURS and there was no fixing the issue. I am now in the process of returning the laptop to Amazon. $400 for a defective product. $400 money well wasted.
1,"This computer is not senior citizen friendly. My Dell refurbished that died in November, did a better job staying connected to WiFi when I lived in Costa Rica, then here in Colombia. The past two days I haven't been able to stay connected to the Internet for more than five to ten minutes. But my Android phone and tablet never get dropped. Don't buy this for any senior citizen in your life."
1,"I didn't need to use the web camera until two weeks after I received the laptop. Turns out the web camera is defective, spent an hour with the tech support and they offered to repair the laptop if I mail it to them. I can't afford to be without a computer for a month until they repair it."
1,Bought this computer for my wife because I have had good luck with Acer laptops in the past. Within 2 months of buying the laptop the dpad and Webcam both stopped working. We sent the laptop in to get fixed under warranty.  ACER sent it back having fixed the Webcam and dpad but now the audio jack doesn't work and the computer that was nice and fast would loose a race against molasses.  I dont know what they did to it but it is worse now then before we sent it in.
1,Everything about the product came malfunctioning. I was literally forced to give a star!
1,"Microsoft edge is the worst browser first off, secondly this laptop did an automatic update and deleted several of my saved documents which are unrecoverable- hours of work are lost. It also blanked out 4x during a timed midterm exam last week.I have had this laptop for just 6 months - sad to say, I won’t purchase Acer again."
1,"Used only ONE TIME, did not transfer any of my files, did not browse the web, I only skyped 1x.  The 2nd time I turned it on - NOTHING!  Black screen.  So, I returned it - What else am I supposed to do with it?  Now I am being charged a ‘Restocking fee’.  Are yoi serious?? B"
1,"This is the second iteration of this computer for me. The first time, I tried everything, and spent hours on the phone with tech support trying to fix that issue (very faint sound). The automatic scan feature did say the audio drivers were not working properly. Reinstalled them twice. No luck. Some things, I had to put my ear within 6 or 8 inches of the speaker. (I am not hard of hearing!) Then the cursor disappeared. The last tech I had talked to told me to buy an external speaker. If this was necessary, shouldn't that be stipulated in the description? My last shot was a call to Amazon tech support. He did not tell me the fix for the disappearing cursor, which I have since figured out, since the second one has the same two problems! I wanted to get a refund but was offered only an exchange or a partial refund. I bought the external speaker. I believe those two problems are just endemic to this laptop. Very annoying! My update is that I have to constantly restart this laptop. It has so many failings it is a zero."
1,"this is the second acer Microsoft windows computer that i have purchased and is completely stopped working using the mandatory password to kill computer, ---acer when called said they could not fix it and Microsoft when called used a newer way of leaving people on hold by redirecting them into computer internet maze that stops any needed service of help . completely riped off by acer,"
1,"Windows crashed two weeks outside the 1 year warranty. Tried to reset to factory settings and it is now in an interminable loop saying that “somethings wrong, let’s reset” and never gets beyond that. Worked great while it did, died an untimely, and non warranty protected death pro much without warning."
1,Avoid this piece of crap. Freezes up after 5 minutes of use.
1,"Has had consistent wifi internet issues since day one. Constantly disconnects. Re-installed drivers multiple times, tried adjusting advanced setting and numerous other remedies. Would not reccomend. Purchased two of these for the kids school and both have the exact same problems. Any computer without reliable internet is pretty much worthless."
1,Got 2 of these. First had about 40% of the screen broken and unreadable. The second screen was completely broken. I could hear Cortana talking but couldn't see anything. Complete garbage. Returning and getting a new brand altogether. This was my last Acer.
1,"I bought this laptop a week ago. The touch pad worked at first. Once, I upgraded Windows 10. The touch pad stopped working. I went to the Acer site, to download a new driver for this pos. Of course it didn't work. That's why I'm giving this a bad review! I've tried several things to fix this laptop. None of them worked!"
1,volume all the way up and it sounds like its set at a very low volume level.  My phone at 1/2 volume is louder than this.VERY disappointed.  You'll need an external wireless speaker.I returned it after the speakers started a crackle and static sound.
1,This is a very low end laptop with limited function. Not ideal for work or school.
1,"Even at this price point, this computer was frustratingly slow. I wasn't able to make it much past set-up before I wanted to through this computer out the window. Instead, I hit the return button. This was purchased for light use and simply could not get the job done. Maybe I got a bad unit, but my experience would lead me to suggest looking at other options."
1,"I have never been so disillusioned with a product in such a short period of time. First of all.. this ""S mode"" thing that so many have complained about. You can't even use the browser of your choice. It was at least easy to remove this function. Then I had 3 more problems in rapid succession that just ruined this computer for me.1. The volume is terrible.. even at maximum and with a few tweaks.. still awful.2. The fan is running, pretty volubly really often.. for no reason. Even when not on ""active"" setting.3. It froze up, unable to ctl alt del, and had to hard shut down when simply browsing the internet.. this was on day 2! I hadn't even had it for 48 hours and already a hard shut down.I'm returning this if I can. It's a bad computer. I would never ever, even at half-price recommend this to anyone!"
1,"The first time I attempted to use my webcam for a important Zoom interview, it would not work. After Acer did hours of trouble shooting, with no resolve, they told me I had no other choice but to reset my laptop to factory settings, which meant I lost almost everything I had on my laptop. When it was determined that losing all of my content was for nothing, they finally checked the device manager and discovered that no Webcam drivers had been installed! They then told me that I would have to pay to send the laptop back to them for repairs! I refused to pay out anything more. Needless to say I Will Never purchase from Acer again.!"
1,"I have had mine now for one month. The maximum battery life I have been experiencing is 2 hours.  When finshed charging I turn in t on,  click on the battery icon and it shows 2hrs 10 minutes at 99% charged. Something is not right here. When I go to the Questions and Answers page it looks like I am not the only one with this issue. I would not recommend anyone buy this computer"
1,"I just received the laptop and configured Microsoft Windows, and immediately downloaded Chrome.  I went to the Microsoft store to switch out of S mode, which was free, so I guess they've heard enough complaints on that one.My experience running chrome from the very start is horrendous.  The fans are on full speed on the ""laptop"", the CPU usage is at 100%, and memory usage floating around 90%.  So I killed chrome to see what's going on, and there is only 800 MB of free memory.  Forget the advertised 4GB of memory.  That is sucked away by Windows and Acer tasks running.  I saw an Acer Registration task taking a significant amount of memory.  After a clean restart, the CPU usage was 30% and memory 55% just sitting there doing nothing.This laptop runs slower than cheap $200 chromebooks I have from 8 years ago.  Videos skip and pop, pages don't scroll well, Chrome even froze while just signing in the first time, and Windows asked me to kill it.  Are you KIDDING me?  This is the worst piece of junk laptop I've ever seen.  It can't even handle browsing the freaking web!  I'll be dumping this piece of junk on ebay at this point.To be sure, I tried out Firefox, and the experience was almost as bad.  It's really just a terrible laptop unless I got a dud."
1,Bought the computer for my son’s online schooling and it froze 3 times in 3 weeks. I asked for a replacement but would only allow me to send it back for repair. That would leave my son without a computer for school. Unexceptional and the person in customer service refused to let me talk to his supervisor.
1,My son couldn't play any of his online games.  Boxed it back up after 20min to return.
1,"This computer cannot install anything. You cant get out of s mode too. You cant install things like wizard101, roblox, and others thing i give it 1  Star!!!!! it is the worst computer ever it takes 5 days to come 208$$$!! and it cant install anything!"
1,"Not satisfied at all!!! No paperwork, no warranty.NOTHING!!!!!!!I am very unhappy and dissatisfied!I ordered this new not used!!!!!I’m not paying for it till I get information"
1,A piece of trash! Was working on it and suddenly it just died! I just bought in April. ITS JULY 8th! Shouldve just rented it. It would have been worth a rented value. So pissed. How does something BRAND NEW JUST DIE???? Dont waste your money!
1,"This computer is terrible, it will not stay connected to the internet and gives no real reason"
1,screen failed to work
1,Web cam had poor picture quality compared to my usb camera with same rating. The display was blurry no matter what theme or setting we changed it too. I should have been more leery of something with thousands of stars but only one written review.
1,The camera is not clear
1,"My old 11"" chromebook was 10 times faster than this one. The backlit keyboard is great but the machine as a whole is a disappointment"
1,It’s ok. Can’t video chat or anything. Touch screen is awful. I should of consulted my teenager before.
1,I used this Chromebook 6/7 times with Facebook and YouTube. I go to use it today and the screen won't even turn on!! Super disappointed and sad.
1,"Hello, I have been using my new computer since I received it and it continues to drop wifi connections. I loose connection to streaming music constantly and when on Zoom/Google calls I am continuously dropped out of them. It is the only device in my house that has this problem. Is there anything I can do to correct this issue or is this a manufacturer issue?"
1,"Did not like operating system, I prefer windows 10 ."
1,Didn't like the laptop need a bigger screen don't like how lights on the keyboard hard to see in the light ...  How can I return the get a better one ..
1,I am having trouble getting on the internet.
1,"This is not an IPS screen so be aware you viewing angle is not only limited but, it a really bad angle. You have to tilt it way back to see true color. It’s ridiculous."
1,"Wifi connectivity is as bad as the reviews say.Wow! I bought this even though multiple reviews stated issues with wifi connectivity.  My sons both have Chromebooks with no issues.  When I got this, like clockwork, immediately wifi issues.  6 hours later I figured out the only way to get access was to reset my router.  Next day, same issues.  Reset router, back up and working. Sorry, not gonna keep doing that daily.  This chrome book is absolutely horrible. DO NOT BUY!!!! The reviews are all correct! Horrible, horrible, horrible!!!"
1,This computer went black and died within 2 months of buying it.  Amazon said their technical support doesn’t cover what to do when the technical problem is the computer won’t turn on.  Trash customer service.
1,Right away it made my internet disconnect all other computers in the house. Very Weird! Brought it back right away!
1,I had problems with printing kept getting error messages spent a total of 6hrs trying to resolve print still gives error message. Returning for refund.
1,Turned it on this morning and noticed dead (bright white) pixel on bottom of screen. I find 1 more it's going right back!
1,I tried using this item as a regular laptop and I hated it. I could not set up the wireless mouse nor the hp printer
1,Not easy set up and did not stay connected to wifi for longer then a min. Returned it.
1,The product was damaged
1,"Most annoying is the poor Wifi connection, it drops a few times a day requiring a restart. The speakers don't sound good, the display is dull, and the chassis is flimsy. It bends very easily when holding it or using it on your lap, which causes the mouse pad to click the right button, either selecting whatever the cursor is on or not allowing you to click on anything else."
1,"I received the HP Chromebook about 4 days after ordering it.I charged it up turned it on, I was so excited.It would never link up to my wifi, which I never had a problem with before.Then I read some reviews and that was a recurring problem.So if you can't link a laptop to wifi you can't be mobile so what's the point in having a laptop.Sent mine back and researching for a one with less problems."
1,"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! We purchased this item for our daughter to use for virtual school. It worked for three days then randomly shut down/lost charge. Then would not charge no matter what we tried. We worked with HP support to try every option to fix. Nothing worked. The only resolution was to to ship it to HP for repair and this process would take a week at minimum if you paid a fee, longer for no charge. No thank you! We returned the item and went with a completely different manufacturer! So frustrating 😞"
1,"I got this 9/11/20,  As of 12/30/20 upper & lower row keys no longer work!!  Save your money."
1,"This is the first product I've had to return on Amazon in 8 years! Even fully charged, even with the charge cord still attached, it lights on entry at charge cord, but keyboard ON button will not turn the computer on! So frustrating, I got the computer for my 10-year-old to do home school, it really has caused us to miss the last week! I thought HP's were a good product no more. I read tons of reviews to decide to order it. Now I need to find another one."
1,The laptop came with a preloaded virus on it. This scam tried to steal $3800 from my account so buyer beware!!!
1,Avoid this product to prevent frustration
1,I have had it for four days and it broke
1,"I just unboxed mine, and it is a total lemon: Instead of booting into Linux happiness I am still stuck watching the onboarding screen flap between ""network not available"" and the spinning dial screen. LAME and shame on HP for selling this crap to the unsuspecting. THIS CHROMEBOOK SUCKS!!!!!!! TOTAL POS DO NOT BUY I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"
1,I brought this product 3 months ago and NOW it does not work!! This is the worst company ever. They won’t replace my laptop that I spent hard earn money on. I do not recommend this company at all!! Ass!!
1,Resolution of display was too low.
1,Horrible. Took 30 min to download an app. I got for my daughter's birthday. So disappointed. 😔
1,"Terrible screen. Not sharp at all. Can't believe this is an ""HD"" screen. Has glare from almost all angles. I have a Toshiba Chromebook 2 (2015) with a far superior screen, cost me about $325 5 years ago. I can't believe that 5 years later, this HP Chromebook has such a poor screen.The item also has scratches in two areas in the plastic around the keyboard. Either sloppy assembly at the factory or it wasn't new. Hmm."
1,"This is a piece of garbage. It keeps shutting down for no apparent reason. You have to perform a ""powerwash"" which is basically a factory reset. First it happens once in a while and then it increases in frequency to where it shuts down every minute or so.Don't waste your money in this useless paperweight."
1,This was a garbage laptop - it lasted 2 months before it went dead. Camera stopped working after a month.
1,"Purchased this laptop in March 2021 and it only lasted six months with light use. One day I could no longer connect to the internet. Ran the troubleshooter and it said it could not find a network adapter. Tried everything suggested, but still can't connect to the internet. Total waste of money!"
1,"The picture description says BACK-LIT KEYBOARD, but it isn't! Whomever designed the website for ASUS should be fired! I went through a big hassle trying to find an ASUS laptop that actually had the back-lit keyboard that was advertised on several of their models, but didn't have it! I wound up buying an ASUS 14"" laptop that actually had the ADVERTISED back-lit keyboard from Office Depot/Office Max. I had them verify it before I bought it."
1,THIS COMPUTER IS TERRIBLE. THE MOUSE WILL GO OUT EVERY SO OFTEN I EVEN TRIED TO RESET AND STILL COULD NOT GET THE MOUSE THE WORK.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS PIECE OF CRAP .
1,Not user friendly.  Couldn't get past first page.
1,Even after updating to latest Windows OS the laptop is ridiculously slowGreat portable laptopBut not even a ok LaptopBuy something else for a little moreLearn from my mistake
1,I only had this laptop for a month and the screen went out on me smh made me so mad 😡
1,"Help from ASUS is impossible, had problems activating Microsoft and they had no idea what they are doing and there phone system was so bad that calls kept dropping took twelve hours being on hold and dropped calls and constantly reidentifying myself"
1,Horrible. Used for minimal school work and it freezes every few minutes
1,Like any other lab top it went to hell!!!
1,"got this for my kid.  touch pad wore out, then it stopped charging, in less than a month of use"
1,Very disappointed.  Product didn't work.  Contacted support and they tried to help but couldn't.  I returned the broken one and I am still waiting for the replacement.  It's been delayed twice.  I am not happy with this 😕😒
1,"I wanted this laptop to do only one thing - act as the control for a label printer, but it couldn't even do that. It took forever to boot, and everyday tasks kept crashing it. Totally useless! I returned it as soon as I could get it to shutdown."
1,It's been more than a month since I got mine and about 3 weeks in the touch pad stopped working. Trying getting it fixed by a technician who wants an arm and a leg to fix it. I'm not a fan of using a mouse so disappointment is an understatement at this stage.
1,"For $200, I didn't expect much. But for a laptop to work slower than a cell phone? That's just unacceptable. When I try to use this laptop, the processor (straight out of the box) keeps running at 100%. I couldn't even open up the task manager. Also, the wireless range of this device is very limiting. I found that this laptop loses connection from my hotel bed whereas my cell phone sustained it flawlessly.This thing is just a waste of money."
1,Bought it for my child to do her school work and it’s awful
1,I bought this laptop but i didn't like it sounds too low i bearly can hear
1,I bought this in April 2 months later the screen turned black on me I barley used it I tried everything this was a waist of money and I’m very disappointed it’s no way I should have problems now
1,Very disappointed.  It never turn back on after the 2nd day of purchase. Very slow.  Not worth the price
1,"Absolute piece of garbage. Fired it up the first time to use it, did all the of required updates, and its already bogged down and running terribly. The 6 year old laptop I had bought this one to replace due to terrible performance is out-performing this laptop. Complete waste of money."
1,Way too small way is smaller than what it look like Very disappointed
1,"Update...This is worse than an HP stream. After a few months, it now locks up about every 3 hours, even with a new OS. Still no backlit keys like they advertised and now it loses wifi unless it has been unplugged for a few hours. Battery life was good - everything else was horrible. They scammed me...I stand scammed. I will say it did hold up to me just now punching the keyboard with my huge fist. It still has a power light."
1,"No backlit keyboardVery very slowBlurry ScreenNumber pad doesn't always work, then sometimes it's too sensitive.Upon checking my system during a data system search, it said mine was an E210 vs an L210.Horrible camera qualityWouldn't work with my wireless mouse.Terrible speaker volumeNo touchscreenNot worth the money and returning for a refund!"
1,"I should have known the price was too good. Save yourself the trouble and don't ""just find out"" by giving it a try, it's not worth it. The computer is the perfect size for my fingers and it has everything I want (I don't need much, just email and streaming services) but it bricked itself by ceasing to charge after only a few weeks of operation and customer service with this company is *non-existent* (we have been trying to return it for *weeks* now and the instructions lead to a dead end). I would give less stars if I could, DON'T PURCHASE, IT'S A SCAM."
1,"Absolutely the worst computer I've touched in years. Screen resolution sucks, doesn't load ANYTHING, couldn't even set it up properly. Returned it the day after I received it."
1,This laptop just completely stopped working. Ive had it less than 2 weeks. I used it twice and the third time i tried to use it it wouldnt come on anymore.
1,MICROSOFT JUNK. Good luck getting out of S mode. Touchpad died after a few days. USB port for the mouse works when it wants to...not often. NWO crap. Do Not Purchase.
1,"Bad computer, slow and doesn’t load."
1,"Product is very limited, very slow to respond"
1,The sound on this was not loud enough so decided to return it.I don't want to have to use earbuds to listen/watch videos.....When i went to set it back to default settings it wouldn't do it.....Dideled with it for 1/2 hr and finally said  f it!.
1,"Bought this for my daughter. She had it about a week, and the mouse completely stopped working. It is very slow when loading. Would not recommend."
1,"I bought this computer for basic computer stuff like social media, videos, email, and other simple stuff.  It is painfully slow.  It is absolutely not my internet.  I have speed tested it several times and have zero issues with any other computer in my home.  It is this single device.  I would never have purchased it if I had any idea.  It is a total time waster.  All websites, not some, ALL take several seconds to load.  This computer harkens back to dial up days.  Ignore any good things said about this computer put on here by ASUS or other bots that claim this is worth it.Don't Do It!You have been warned!"
1,Not exactly what I expected green is not that great can you can’t get virtual background as well.
1,Opening computer really a pain in the back.
1,"Don't buy this item!! Just stop working on my today out of nowhere. It sits on my mini desk, so no I have never dropped it. Big waste of money so upset with this item and seller."
1,"I was very disappointed with this item, it was so extremely slow I had to return it after 2 days. Just hitting the start button and pulling up something as simple as the paint program took this computer a full minute to load.  Really not worth your time, I bought this as a gift for my dad who has the worlds oldest laptop yet that still ran faster than this.."
1,"It's fine otherwise, but the trac pad stopped working a few days after we started using it."
1,Sound stopped working completely after a week
1,its fuzzy and hard to use
1,The sound is horrible lots of static the picture not good all I wanted to do is do zoom an the quilts is horrible people can never hear me. Did not start using my laptop until a month after I received it but it was to late to send called the company they had me to reset it and it’s still no better I am so disappointed with this product
1,The wifi range is terrible. The number keypad really slows you down because it comes on so easy. Drives me crazy. Had to by a mouse to stay away from touchpad. Runs slow when multiple tabs are up.
1,Piece of Junk. stopped working after one month. Amazon refuses to solve the problem. Refer back to Asus
1,Frustratingly slow to load anything
1,It is not user friendly.
1,I am unable to use Zoom meeting because of the audio and microphone will not connect to Zoom. I do not recommend it.
1,The touch pad on this laptop was terrible! Many times it would type a line of letters or characters without my touching the pad. Sometimes ifmy hand got close to the pad it would change screens and I would have an awful time getting back to the screen.  Most of the time I would have to go back to the beginning and start over.  It was also verrry sloooow.  I am very disappointed with the product.
1,Slowest device I’ve ever had. Constant interruptions and pauses. All my other devices in the house are running fine. I bought this brand new.Update: the screen has completely stopped working. ASUS says I have to send the laptop in and pay to have it fixed!
1,This thing takes 30 mins to restart after downloading an update. Unacceptable.
1,"very tiny item,...company that ell item is not a good company!"
1,"Stay away from Windows 10 S ! Let me tell you what it is ..... trash 🗑!!!!!!! You can’t download anything from browser unless is from their crappy App Store! I couldn’t download Sketchup ! This is the worst part you CANT use GOOGLE!!! Like what the F ! They only allow you to use Bing ,who in the right mind uses that search engine!! No oneeee! You have to pay 50 bucks to upgrade to Windows 10 pro to be able to use your brand new computer like a normal person would like to do! Very very disappointed with this stupid “windows 10s” upgrade! (Not even an upgrade)!!!!! Please do your self a favor and buy a Mac !"
1,365 micro soft is useless
1,"Trackpad sucks. cannot install any application other than the apps in Microsoft store., not even google chrome."
1,Have to swipe screen to get anywhere. Keypad figures aren’t big enough for a newborn. I was going to return but last day was yesterday. Do no recommend.
1,This tablet is in Spanish only and no one can assist me with it.
1,"This tablet is a real trainwreck. It always was unbelievably slow and after the last update it barely runs at all. Buy something else, anything else. This is a major disappointment."
1,"As title reads: If you need to mirror the tablet screen to a TV, then this is not the table you are looking for. I am considering returning mine just because of this. it is unacceptable that a 2019 device doesn't have this feature!!"
1,I think this thing was made to be slow.  Samsung electronics suck anymore.
1,Worst purchase I’ve ever made!!
1,It was a mistake to buy this. I bought this to use in my kitchen for recipes and whatnot but I see now that was a mistake. The pixel or picture quality is horrible. Forget about zooming into any text. It just gets blurry as you make it bigger. This is also very very slow. It takes forever to start up and lags when watching videos. I will be returning.  Do not buy.
1,I wish I had read the reviews. This is some backwards tech if I've ever seen it. I didn't bother to look into how this was charged because I assumed having owned older Samsung products it would be USB-C. This is such a disappointment my old Lenovo tablet was USB-C as well as my old Samsung phone! Returning this immediately. Don't make the same mistake I did!
1,Don't  buy this tablet  a big rip off very  slowYou can't  play any game right  because  the screen  doesn't let your  fingers  slide  smooth on the screen and the tablet  gets hot to fast.Don't  waste your money.
1,They were duds didn’t work blacked out in three days and Amazon wouldn’t help basically told me I have to keep it
1,"This tablet computer lacks several features that were present on my older Galaxy Tab A 10.1:1. The new tablet lacks a hard Home button. This is inconvenient because I use the tablet for running Garmin Pilot software. Having a hard Home button is easier to use while flying that the soft button.2. On my old tablet I was able to move apps from internal storage to an SD card, thus saving internal storage space. The new tablet does not allow for moving apps to an SD card. Very disappointed.Had I known about these problems before I bought the new tablet, I would not have purchased it.I tried using the tablet today while flying. I use the Garmin Pilot app for navigation and flight information. The display did not show all of the information provided by the app. For example, it failed to display the ""Direct To"" icon. This makes the tablet almost useless when used for running the Pilot app.This afternoon, I contacted Amazon and asked for a refund. I returned the tablet computer to a local Amazon site.Regrettably, the tablet proved almost worthless in light of the use for which it was purchased."
1,This pos has so much useless crappy function but it won’t let you scroll though photos. Heck with Samsung
1,Christmas present to my mom and 5 months later the screen is flickering and it’s unusable. No support or ability to return on Amazon at this point unfortunately.Based on searching on line this is a common problem with this device. None of the recommended remedies worked.
1,"This the 2nd Samsung Galaxy Tab A that I've ordered. The first was freezing up and had colors that off. Now the 2nd Tab A has same problem. All colors are off, even on games."
1,Have used for less than 6 months and just stopped working. Tried various chargers to isolate with same result.
1,Samsung screwed the customer with this product.  They have disabled the smartview ability on this tablet so you cannot screen mirror with this tablet.  A true shame.  I was intending on screen mirroring my samsung tablet to my samsung tv.  Now i have to instead use my iphone???  Wtf??  Done with samsung.  Stupid.
1,Had this tab for two months. Worked fine until it died. Tablet is fully charged but screen remains dark when I try to power it up. I can't  find a system reset button and I'm  note sure what to do next except to try to return it. Not sure if it's still under warranty. I'll talk to support and see what they say.
1,It was OK until I tried to cast my tablet screen to my smart TV. This tablet does not support it. My older Samsung tablet does but the feature has been removed from this particular tablet. Shame on you Samsung.I'll never buy another Samsung tablet again.
1,Didn’t last a year. Very disappointed. Screen stopped working and it also operated slowly from the get go. Attempted to get warranty support and was told I had to go through a different company than Samsung and may have to pay and then the Samsung representative hung up on me. I had also gone through chat advisor that said I could send it in for service. Bad experience.
1,"I didn't even get to turn it on, I took the tablet out of the box to charge it and the pins are broken inside the charger port of the tablet. I knew it was refurbished when I bought it. But I would have thought it would have been fully inspected it before reselling."
1,I think we got a lemon as we bought two for our children and only my sons is working satisfactorily. We have endless problems with one of them. So frustrating. Do not waste your money
1,Died after 6 months
1,Absolute garbage. Had the product for 3 months and it stopped working. DO NOT BUY
1,Was not user friendly.
1,"I am sure this was not a new Tablet but it stated at the time I bought it, it was in the description that is was new never used. The whole top of screen doesn't work at all we have to turn it to the side just to get it to work. Trying to get ahold of the company to do a return is horrible and we got no where."
1,But after just 3 months the battery is dead look for a  different brand!
1,I didn’t know it was WIFI only. My fault I didn’t read the description. I sent it back.
1,"Treasure Truck's mobile text offer advertised a ""new"" 2021 Samsung Tab A 8 - what I received is the 2019 version.  After doing some research - that I should have already done, shame on me - I learn that at this time there IS NOT a 2021 version of this tablet.  What were they thinking advertising something that they could not deliver on, and sending something entirely different?  So disappointed in Amazon."
1,My daughter hasn’t had it a year yet and it just stop charging.
1,Stopped working less then 90 days can not get help for this problem a very disappointing company. New product.
1,"This tablet is pretty slow, much worse than the ipad and fire I bought with same 2gb RAM about 2 years ago. As this is a new tablet, I only installed 5 apps and when 3 apps open it already gets laggy. Very disappointing! I've already bought case and screen protector for it, am struggling if I should return it"
1,Worst purchase of my life! So slow as to be useless. Save your sanity. This is actually fraudulent. See the repeated references to Featherweight. It's Really Heavy. I've had several previous tablets over many years. NO!
1,Product has an issue charging..never had this issue with my iPads. Returning the item.Update: now I can’t get my refund or myReturned product back. The company is giving me a hard time and being demanding. Very unprofessional..I wouldn’t recommend buying this product or from this company!!
1,"The touch sensitivity is terrible. The apps keep freezing and glitching. With the unlock screen you have to swipe it just right or it won't open.I had discord on it and had the same problem. If you didn't swipe just right, nothing happened, and sometimes it would just freeze for a few seconds.The other app I had problems with was ibis paint x. I'm trying to do digital art, it's the sole purpose I bought this tablet. It supported the app I wanted which is why I choose this tablet specifically, but I can't draw anything because it keeps glitching a freezing, breaking the lines up into dots or not making a line at all. Overall, I'm extremely disappointed with this tablet and will be returning it if I am able to."
1,"this model does not have screen share capability.  You can't add an app to push the screen to a TV, which I use a lot. Had to return a got the AT&T model in stead.  Also strangely has a Micro-USB charging port, which most other phones and tablets abandoned 5 years ago."
1,Purchased this device in March on  Monday December 14th the screen went completely black and never came back on. 9 months and there is no reimbursement or compensation for the device very disappointed .
1,Screen quality  is average.  Battery life feels low unless you are always in power saver mode. The touchscreen  is so unresponsive that simple tasks such as browsing the web are frustrating. Performance is generally so bad that I turn it off in disgust and end up just searching out the nearest computer. I will not recommend  this model and regret the purchase.
1,"This tablet is unbelievably slow and unresponsive... not just compared to a higher end tablet, but very disappointingly slow. Certain apps just don't work well either, either crashing or being unresponsive. I guess you can't expect a budget tablet to work even decently. Very disappointed."
1,"I have had wifi issues almost from the start and had to order a wifi dongle which did work briefly then that too stopped working, so there is something fundamentally wrong with my tablet.  Also when plugging it into the computer via usb there is no option for connecting as a data device ie being able to load files onto the tablet that way. It simply starts to charge and the computer cannot see it; maybe the cable is wrong kind?  no settings anywhere that I can find.  Numerous attempts at restoring factory defaults, etc to no avail.  No solutions found online, this pisses me right off.  I suspect some kind of software or firmware incompatibility that Samsung doesn't bother fixing since it is an older model - something that can't play nice with my new-ish xfinity router.  OR a faulty part."
1,"My instinct told me to get the Amazon Fire for my daughter, but I went with the Samsung instead.  What a mistake!  First, as another viewer states, it's slow, but the one star is not for lack of speed.  A tablet isn't a computer, so my expectations aren't very high when it comes to speed.  However...I do expect it to (1) hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time and (2) Actually be able to charge.  From the beginning this device didn't hold a charge for long, and as time went on, charging became more difficult.  I bought other chargers, nothing helped.  And now, after just six months, the device won't charge at all.  So I'm buying the Fire that I should have in the first place.  Live and learn."
1,"""Products sold by Samsung Electronics Latinoamerica are warranted against manufacturing defects""👎United States warranty no👎Smart View no👎"
1,Stop working after 2 months
1,We bought these to replace the same model (older) that our kids had previously run into the ground after several years of daily use and within a couple months we have a cracked screen. I am inclined to blame it on the new model because I don't feel that this has gotten any abuse that the other two hadn't had over and over again with the previous model. Super bummed out and will probably go with a cheaper fire tablet in the future.
1,"The sole reason this tablet was purchases was to play Clash Royal, Clash of Clans, and stream Netflix.Three simple tasks this tablet FAILED to complete. Despite updating the software for both the system and all the apps, there was far too much lag that ruined the experience. Since only three apps were installed, storage was not an issue. The issues don't end there, the screen was a bit off, as i was typing for some reason it would detect that i tapped the same letter a few times.I have been been using Samsung products for years, and I'm honestly extremely disappointed."
1,Wont even connect to WiFi no matter what. What a waste of money!
1,Don’t buy this tablet in 2 months stop working and amazon won’t help me with replacement
1,"Very, very disappointed in this product.  From the moment it was first turned on, this pad could not maintain a continuous internet connection despite our strong in-home wi-fi signal. It would only connect manually, and couldn't retain the wi-fi password. We have been a Samsung family for about 15 years, but this Samsung tablet and our last one have not performed well.  I'll be shopping for a non-Samsung replacement."
1,Everything with the exception of the picture taking capabilities. Otherwise terrible.
1,"I purchased a new tablet, but received a refurbished one. Very disappointed and since I don’t live in the states it isnt worth my while to return it."
1,Bought this one to replace my daughters broken one. Called at&t to add service to it and after an hour and a half we discovered it doesnt have an imei number. This thing is useless now unless we are at home. The whole reason we bought it was for when we were taking long car rides. You get what you pay for.
1,Bag came empty so upsetting
1,"Expandable to 512gb but you can't move ANY apps to the SD Card. WHY? I bought a 512gb card, and half of my internal 32gb is filled with apps I can't move.  I feel like I got screwed twice!  I don't use my tablet as a camera, or for music.  What's the point of the SD Card, if I can't use it for anything but pics & music?"
1,So slow not much else to say about it. I ordered to work on my cricut so that was the only app i had downloaded and the tablet was so slow i had to press super hard on the screen to move anything. I ended up returning because i hated it so much.
1,"A total waste of money.  I couldn't watch youtube, no netflix or other streaming videos due to poor  video quality that made the video appear scrambled.  It wasn't my WIFI connection either because video streaming was fine on my other 2 three year old Galaxy's."
1,OMG! Micro-USB in 2019? When the 2017 version had USB-C? Really? Sent this back. I didn't even think that it could be this bad. Just no.
1,"I purchased this tablet for my daughter back in November 2019.After about 6 months of light use, the tablet is not charging.It happened a couple days ago.I bought a new charger and sill not charging.I am not sure if it's the battery itself."
1,This has to be Samsung's worse tablet to hit the market.  It wouldn't sync my calendar or my contacts and it was extremely slow.  Terrible product!  Don't waste your money.
1,"If you're uninterested in being able to connect your tablet to the Internet, then this tablet is quite good.  But it has persisting problems with WiFi connectivity.More specifically, it does not readily connect and stay connected to 2.4 GHz WiFi hotspots.  Samsung has been stonewalling the issue.  They avoid mentioning it altogether when they can, and their ordinary trouble-shooting guide does not mention it at all.  When, in a forum, someone specifically mentions the problem, then a Samsung representative may suggest configuring the hotspot to use 5 GHz signals.  This advice is worthless for a mobile device, as one has little or no control over the configurations of hotspots in cafés. (And of course it's rather rotten to be told that one must invest in a new hotspot at home because the tablet isn't actually what was promised.)It may be that the problem could be fixed with a software update, but in any case Samsung has evidently resolved not to bear the costs of fixing it."
1,"Avoid buying. It became a headache after just 3 months of use. Suddenly it stopped charging. The USB port got damaged, and after it was repaired then the sound didn't work.A complete nightmare.Made in China with cheap and low quality materials."
1,Charger port became loose and non functional after just 2 months of normal use! Would not recommend.
1,"I own a 2017 Tab A that I've had for a few years now. The battery is starting to hold slightly less charge these days and I think the screen has faded a bit, so I decided to look into the 2019 model to see if it's worth the $139 upgrade price. The 2019 has a little faster processor and more space (32GB vs 16GB). Same screen resolution. Same RAM (REALLY wished they had bumped this up to 3GB). Same speakers as far as I can tell. Same Bluetooth version. Both running Android 9.0. Not a huge jump by any means but it's only $139 so why not?So I order it and when it arrives right off the bat I notice that the 2019 has backtracked to the old mini-usb port vs my 2017 with the USB-C. WHY WHY WHY Samsung would you do this? To save $2? Deal breaker. Could I live with the mini-usb? Yeah if I had to, but dammit Samsung, when  purchase a newer model I don't expect to go backwards in *any* tech.So I am returning this tablet. I guess I'll muddle along with my old 2017 model for awhile longer until Samsung gets their head out of their butts and fixes this stupidity."
1,purchased the product in december as a christmas gift.. it lasted lesss than  90 days not wont take the charge... per the seller (Electronic Expresscall) call the manufacture we cant help you... nice
1,It didn’t last 3 months and there no help to replace it
1,"I bought this only over a month and the device is getting  into infinite restart. Now. I have to work with Samsung support to get this repaired. First, I just bought this just over a month ago, should they send me a new one instead of waiting for this? Secondly, Samsung support is terrible, they have all my contact information, but they said they cannot reach me and blame on of lack of communication! Well, they can text me, but they never left voice email plus they have my email, why don’t attempt to reach me by email!"
1,"The unit itself looks great and has a very nice screen. But, IT WILL NOT STAY CONNECTED TO WIFI. PERIOD. I have reset this unit several times and tried all sorts of tech support tips and nothing works. When it does connect, it stays connected for just long enough to download any updates. But, during that time you cannot access anything on-line. After downloading updates, it disconnects and will not reconnect, even if I re-start. While trying to work through this issue, I let the ""return by"" date pass, so I am essentially stuck with a mostly useless gadget. I only wanted a basic device to occasionally get on-line and to occasionally stream some music - and I can't even make that happen. I am disappointed with this Samsung product."
1,it is to hard to set up so I sent it back
1,"I'm trying desperately to replace my Samsung S2 8"" tablet. The Tab A is slower than my 4 year old model and less responsive to touch. I was also unable to find a suitable case, even directly from Samsung. It's going back."
1,"Its a piece of unreliable junk, Amazon refused to take it back or get it fixed."
1,Included Charger was Not Samsung brand (OEM) and was DOA.
1,So the tablet came in mint condition which I was happy about. But only was able to use it for one day before it stopped working. After an update from the tablet itself prompted a message to come up that read tablet was no longer working needed to be sent in to be fixed. Turned it off and back on again that’s the only message that pops up on the screen does not let you move past that screen.
1,For the life of me I'll never understand why some of these brands make apps that aren't moveable to SD storage. This 8 GB device had 7 GB being used up by adware and junkware. Basically unusable and most downloaded apps aren't moveable to an SD card. 0/10 would not buy again.
1,touch screen was bad
1,"This thing is so annoyingly slow. Plus the sd card capability is virtually worthless at this point since you can't move apps over to the card easily. Oh and micro sd. No rapid charging. I get it's not a 600 dollar tablet but you can get this capability on 150 dollar options.Bottom line,  in this day and age there is no reason for a ~150-200 dollar tablet to be so ungodly unresponsive. Don't waste your money."
1,This was one of my worst purchase. After a few weeks it stopped charging. There was no option provided for this product to be returned. I am now stuck with a defective product.
1,"I chose this tablet based only on RAM. I need the speed and performance for recording audio and video. RAM specifications are specified as 32GB, unfortunately it only has 1.5i sh. I'm going to do a couple basic test to determine if the processing speed will be sufficient for tasks I need  before I pack it up and send it back"
1,"The tablet would not reconnect to my Wi-Fi after 3 days. All devices in my home, tablets, phones and home automation connected and functioning. I searched YouTube and Google for solutions to no avail. VERY FRUSTRATING!"
1,"The only colors this tablet has are pea green, army green, brown and black. There are no other colors for ANYTHING"
1,I only give bad reviews
1,To bad I missed my return window.  2.0 write speeds...
1,Not robust. Cheesy.
1,"I've never been able to copy large files on my Mac, it always throws an error. This has been the case for 3 Mac OS versions and 2 different Macs using APFS and APFS (Encrypted). It's totally unusable for me."
1,"I bought two of this a year ago to store images with their original quality from my phone.It now feels like throwing money in a fire pit.The app is buggy. I have waited for an update to fix the various issues forever. It was never fixed. It fails most of the time to identify its own drive!!! Can you believe that?Every time I stick it to a computer or phone regardless of the OS (and I have all of them) the chance it gets recognized is one out of ten!! How can you call that a dependable product?The durability is really bad. In less than a year, the hinge that is supposed to help you flip between the two ports stopped working. It made it nearly impossible to stick the usb or the usb-c anywhere because there is no resistance.Also, the actual storage is a lie, it is much much lower than advertised and the speed is crazy slow.Save your money... don't buy. It is not that I have gotten a bad one. Both turned out faulty and fell apart. A company that doesn't respect you is not worth your time or hard-earned money."
1,It’s not 128GB it’s 32GB. What a shame
1,I ordered this USB so I can back up pics and vids for my upcoming vacation directly connected to my phone.. but it does not connect.. so it was a waste of money.. I will still use it as a USB Stick for the computer but I will look elsewhere for a C-type connecter Memory.
1,Absolutely disappointed because is not a cheap memory stick.
1,USB Drive jammed and stuck during second use.
1,"I have owned this for a few months.. and it gets REALLY HOT. In turn, it makes my computer really hot. I mean hot to touch. Dangerous. Awful. Trash."
1,Didn't work on any of my 3 androids . only works on out dated phones what a total joke n rip off! Another internet bought paper weight! Risk catching disease going shopping or head ace of buying and retuning stuff online can't win!
1,Poor quality
1,"Mine stopped working after a year, it doesnt open or anything and I didnt even use it that much"
1,"It took me close to 10 minutes to write a ~2GB file from ipad pro to this drive when the flashdrive was almost empty. Even for dslr photos these days, this would be unusable :("
1,"had the 128gb version, write speeds were as expected, 30-60mb/s.decided to order another so i got the 256gb drive and it's just awful. At first I was only getting 2-3mb/s so I reformatted to ntfs, now im getting 10-15mb/s. Pretty awful and near unusable."
1,Unfortunately it never worked from the moment I took it out of the box!I am in Uruguay at the moment and returning it for a refund makes no sense because of the high cost of shipping.Regrettable!
1,"Unfortunately, this did not work"
1,"The Type-C end does not fit into my Macbook Pro. It sticks out a lot, so I think it isn't going in properly, and so my Macbook doesn't recognize the drive. The Type-A end worked on my PC laptop, so I know the drive itself works. I'm in the process of getting an exchange now, but the fact that I have to drive to a UPS and waste gas just to return the defective drive is annoying."
1,"Haven't had this long, and now it won't work at all. Piece of junk. Going in the trash. A waste of 20 bucks."
1,"I would say I'm disappointing, the usb head does not stay unfolded with the slightest pressure, It can't be inserted in the usb port. I contacted amazon as a seller, my situation was, I couldn't send it back from where I was ( way far from US), and they could not replace or refund this one, ok, fair enough, but I had to wait for the answer about my problem for 15 minutes just staring to an open chat with delayed answers,  explain my situation several times still getting standard lines and then just left without e response. This is a first time  I received such a horrible customer service. bad product, bad service, 1 star, very disappointing."
1,"Can't review it will because it never worked.  It connects to my phone but when I transfer files it fails every time. Looking at the app reviews in the Google playstore, many other people are having issues."
1,"I got this as I regularly need to work with both a MacBook that only has USB-C ports and PCs that have regular USB 3.0 ports, and I figured this would be ideal.  Unfortunately this drive suffers from a fatal design flaw: the latch that secures the drive port in place when extended is far, far too weak and collapses when trying to insert it into any PC that I've tried (and I've tried a lot).  The result is the drive only gets half-inserted and won't work at all, and any attempt to hold it in place while inserting only results in finger pain as you attempt to hold the tiny latch so it doesn't pop back inside the casing.  This makes the drive completely useless at best and injurious at worst."
1,"I purchased this product 35 days ago and plugged it into the USB port twice during that time. The locking mechanism is weak and will not lock rendering the thumb-drive useless for a third application. Unfortunately, it is non-returnable at this point.This is not like SanDisk to put out such a shoddy flash drive."
1,DislikeCan't have a chance to use yet due did not fit right in my cel phone C jack.Very disappointed ☹️.
1,Cheap materials for the price. It get damaged very fast. Not worth it.
1,"The write speed is terribly slow. I get at most 18MB write speeds and 140MB Read speeds. Also the lever to switch between Type C and Type A plugs is very weak so whenever I try to connect the Type A side into a port, it would slide back into the thumb drive which would make it annoying trying to plug it into anything."
1,The USB C port is really bad on this. It damaged my MacBook USB port. I’m so mad. Paid 3k for my Mac and this $10 junk damaged it. Don’t buy this
1,Probably top worst product I’ve purchased from amazon. Transferring files to it took hours. I wish I would have read the reviews before opening because now I’m stuck with it.
1,"Does not work with my iPad Pro 2018 with C port.Sandisk told me i need a 3.0 USB C unitSandisk, however, shows the 3.1 as compatibleJust wasted my money"
1,"I bought this disk for the convenience of having USB-C and USB-A ports in one drive.  This feature works fine.  BUT believe the reviews that complain about two things with this product:1. Slow write speeds, and2. how HOT the unit gets when writing to it.This drive writes incredibly slowly.  I had about 40GB of cloud storage that I wanted to back up to this drive--the drive's capacity is 256GB.  The estimated time to complete it was ""More than One Day.""  Ummm... yeah.  That's slow.  I cancelled it after about an hour.  And in the process, the drive got VERY hot.  I bought Sandisk based on the namebrand alone (I have always liked their products).  Can't do that anymore--should have read the reviews first."
1,"I bought a sandisk before but this time they gave me wrong 256GB Ultra Dual Drive USB Type-C  and its printed on it  saying its 256GB but when i plug it in the computer, its said 30GB. I paid  $40  for a 30GB rather a 256GB!"
1,"Write performance is terrible, and sometimes slower than older USB 2.0 flash drives.Drive also at some point became stuck as read-only, which I haven't been able to fix -- looks like it's destined for the bin."
1,"The whole thing is loose, and the metal USB interface retracts when you try to insert it.  Avoid this item at all costs."
1,"I purchased two go the 128GB to transfer files from my iMac USB A to my new MacBook Pro USB C.  The USB A side worked fine on my iMac, but couldn’t get the USB C to plug into my new MacBook Pro.  It is useless for the task I intended it for.  I have purchased many SanDisk USB A flash drives over the years, but this is the worst quality product I ever bought.Would not recommend it if you want to use it with a MacBook Pro."
1,"Absolutely horrendous write speed it took 1 hour and 40 minutes to transfer a 12gb file. Completely unacceptable, even the usb c transfer rate were ridiculous at 1 hour 30 minutes for the same file size."
1,USB C end broke after 8 weeks with very little use
1,"It looked so easy to operate on the ad but it has proven worthless in real life. I had to search for some on line instructions, none of which helped.  Somewhere, it was suggested to activate or get OTG (whatever that is), but that was impossible to find/activate. I made most of my photo transfers by simply connecting a cable between the android phone and the computer. Don't waste your money.  Very, very disappointing product. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with it now."
1,"The force needed to insert the USB-C side of this drive into a MacBook Pro Thunderbolt port causes the connector to slide back into the case.  Even applying pressure to the slide mechanism while inserting does not help.  I had to completely remove the case from the drive in order to be able to use it.  Now it has no longer has the structural support, dust protection, durability, etc that the case provides.  It is now relegated to at-home file transfer use as I would not feel safe throwing it in bag and taking it on the go.  Otherwise, it functions great to transfer files and use between USB 3.1 and USB-C devices."
1,"I wanted to use this to transfer files back and forth between a computer that has only USB-C and one that has only USB-A. It worked for about a week, but then the little plastic sliding piece popped off. I put it back on, but now its missing again. Must have fallen off again when I didn't notice it. It's effectively USB-C only now. The latching never felt very good."
1,"Cannot connect with google photos only google drive. So if your planning to use this for photos forget about it.  I have a cheap, dual drive, no app required for a photo frame that does a better job than this. No way to get to google photos from the drive folder in the app. You would have to move everything to drive. It was not an available as a share option from the google photos app. It also would only move 50 pictures from drop box and then said ""failed"" everytime after. 256gb? I can only get 50 photos to transfer over. Useless and a waste of money!"
1,"I have always had bad experiences with USB drives and this one continues that legacy.  While the 256GB storage size is great and the read speeds are decent, the write speeds are horrendous.  Had I done my homework better, I would never have bought this drive.  This drive can't hit 20MB/s even when copying from an NVME drive.  OTG support is also bad.  While I did not buy this for OTG usage, the fact that SanDisk claims it supports OTG is a joke.  My OnePlus 5 cannot see the drive.  Yes, OTG is on.  SanDisk's own app says the drive is not supported.  The fact that SanDisk says to format the drive in FAT32 if the device doesn't work with the default exFAT is joke.  You cannot format a 256GB drive in FAT32.  The connector slider is too loose.  Sometimes plugging in the drive pushes the connector back into the drive.  And holding the slider to prevent that would be easier if the drive wasn't so tiny.  This thing is going to be very easy to lose.  There is a spot to attach a lanyard, but the hole is so small it is useless for anything but sewing thread.Edit: I forgot to mention, this thing gets ridiculously hot when using it.  Watch your fingers on the metal parts."
1,"The flash drive is no longer functional.  I am very sorry because I have lost all my data, photos and videos kept and I can no longer recover them.  It worked very well initially, then suddenly it broke."
1,"Just got it about 10 minutes ago and already can tell you the speed sucks. I’m patient enough to wait, but for those who aren’t, this is not for you."
1,It stopped working after about 10 uses. Does not show up as a storage device anywhere in my computer's USB devices.Stay away.
1,Mechanism to switch between USB A and C ports broke within a few days. Making it impossible to insert into the port as attempting to do so will cause the drive's USA A or C port to retract into the casing. Useless piece of junk and poorly made
1,Wouldn't work with my Galaxy Note 8. Wasted many hours trying.
1,"Poor design, returned as faulty.Unit continually retracted when inserted.The USB C end was also ill fitting to insert."
1,"The product doesn't work and the C part comes lose from yuor phone. Total wast of time and money, which by the way, I paid $40 and they wantto return only $20. THINK BEFORE YOU BUY IT AND NOTICE THAT THIS IS NOT SCANDISK. BUNCH OF THIEVES"
1,"I have two of these, 32GB and 128 Gb, 128GB one doesnt sit all the way home on the laptop, I almost damaged the port on my laptop while trying to put it in the place. Sadly I have only used the USB side until yesterday which was passed return date, now I realized USB C side will not work. I'd like to have it replaced for free if seller sees this."
1,"Is not functions well, not easy to operate"
1,"Suddenly my device is writing blocked, I can't add or remove files, neither format it. Only view current files."
1,not easy to use; waste of money
1,The problem I have with this usb is the switch is broken. It still works but switching it from usb a to usb 3.1 is more difficult than it needs to be. I looked at the switch and realized it isn’t a defective item. It was poorly designed.
1,"Perfectly functional the first year, but it's unacceptable that it completely dies just shortly after one year of use. I have an old USB thumb drive from over 5 years ago that still works just fine."
1,"This is a slow writing but handy drive.The good.  It is compact.  It can use both USB-A and -C.  The read speeds are competitive.The bad.  The write speeds are a joke!  20 mbps max.  And it’s no where on the package or website.  They boast about the 150mbps read and say “write speeds will be less.”Oh, they know they’re hiding the details.  Even my micro SD card claims write speeds up to 90 mbps.  To give you an idea, I transferred 160gb from an NVMe drive to my “on board” 3.1 and -C ports and it was stuck under 20mbps.  It took 2.5 hrs to upload to this drive.  I plugged an evo 860 ssd into a $10 usb 3.0 case and moved the same data.  It said under 30min.  It was transferring at over 250mbps.For $40, this is a bad buy.  Spend a few more dollars.  Get a 500gb 860 and put it into an enclosure.  The time you’ll save will be well worth it.  And you’ll have twice the data.  I would send this thing back if I didn’t have to pay for the return!"
1,"This doesn't fit properly into my USB-C port of my MacBook Pro, requires tremendous force to insert it."
1,"Sliding function broke immediately on both of the ones I ordered. A lot hard to get into the USBC port than any other plug, that ended up putting too much stress on the weak sliding mechanism and they broke within the first 5 uses. Not worth shipping back so I stripped off the enclosure and will print something more functional. Major letdown."
1,It broke. I can't switch it anymore. It is a poorly made product
1,Doesn't connect on my MacBookPro or Dell laptops with the USB-C. The plug is horrible. The USB 3 plug works fine. Kind of chintzy.
1,"The slider broke the first time this usb was put into the port on a Mac book, it just popped right off. The computer was never able to recognize the USB C side of the drive either, but the other side works fine. SanDisk quality is not what it used to be, recently had to return a memory card that was corrupt when it arrived as well. Not impressed"
1,Read only error after 3 months of little usage
1,"I can't be bothered trying to measure the speed of this thing, but subjectively compared to what I usually buy - SanDisk Extreme CZ80 64GB USB 3.0 Flash Drive - this thing is crazy slow on USB-C, which is supposed to be a faster interface. This thing is a waste of time, literally."
1,"I should have read the negative reviews more carefully: The write speed is ridiculously slow. What's worse, in minutes, the usb stick gets quite hot. That's either a bad design or defective hardware or both. Either way, the Amazon return window is now closed, so I'm stuck with this useless usb stick, but I hope others will pay heed."
1,I received the 128GB and 14 GB is unavailabe. I can understand some capacity being reduced but this is ridiculous.
1,Would give a 0 if I could! This product is defective and does not work at all
1,does not fit flush into any usbc port so the computer does not even recognize it. And it gets hot.
1,"I bought my first one on October 29, 2016. It failed in July of 2019 and was exchanged under warranty repair (they have a 5 year warranty). The exchanged on just failed today in the same way: the content ""disappeared"", but after safely ejecting and reinserting, the content reappears, but as read-only. The drive is no longer writable and it cannot be repaired or reinitialized (erased) under Windows or macOS--tried with several tools.  At least the data is there--although I can't be sure none is missing.  So the warranty exchange unit failed in just over two months.  I'm using this as a backup secondary drive when mobile with my laptop and I cannot afford for it to be unreliable. I'm done trusting this brand/product."
1,"Having to return for refund after speaking to Amazon and SanDisk support. The USB 3.0 male connector inserted fine and I could read the drive. However, the USB-C male connector would only insert about 2/3 of the way in. I could not read the drive using the USB-C port with either of the 4 ports on my MacBook nor on my muti-port adapter. I also read reviews where users had the same exact problem and pressed hard enough to break their port(s). I applied moderate pressure and wiggled the drive but there is obviously an obstruction and it is defective. I can only assume poor product quality assurance at SanDisk which is a shame because my past experiences with their products have been really good."
1,"This flash drive can be finicky to insert in my MacBook, I think it actually damaged one of my ports. Doesn’t seem to fit correctly and I cannot get it to connect properly without an uncomfortable amount of pressure so I don’t use it much. Maybe I will through a USB hub but that’s it. Would of returned it if was more expensive."
1,I bough this to use it on my Note 9 and IPad Pro. It does not even get recognized by either device. US 2100 dollars wasted. Stay away from it. It’s a shame because my past drives from this company have been very reliable.
1,Worst hard drive i have ever used. Can only store up to 500 mb files then stop reacting. Incredibly hot when writing files.
1,"I didn't bother reading the reviews since this is SanDisk, the gold standard in flash drives, boy did I maker a mistake. I bought the 256GB version to move about 140GB of video files to it, and I am currently getting less than 10 mb/s write speed which is the slowest speed I've seen in a decade.Simply avoid this drive at all costs, it's 100% crap."
1,"I've been purchasing SanDisk products regularly for years. As the head of the IT department, I distribute USB Flash Drives to co-workers on a regular basis. As a photographer I use SanDisk products exclusively. Well.... I couldn't be more disappointed in this product. The quality control on them is atrocious and perhaps the design is in part to blame. I was hoping the would work for the growing number of USB C laptops we deploy. They're just not going to work out.After some use, several have become ""stuck"" and the connector wont slide out without what most people would consider undue force. That's probably due to poor design. I haven't bothered to crack one open to see what the real issue is--I don't think SanDisk has either. Other users find these flash drives have simply been problematic on insertion and the subsequent pullout/reinsert loop results in the OS simply never recognizing the device. Sometimes when inserting the drive, the whole connector collapses back into the shell like a recalcitrant turtle.My users are frustrated, I'm frustrated. I'm just going to go back to the tried and true standard versions along with telling the users ""please don't lose your USB A to USB C adapter"". Maybe I'll switch to another style, but be forewarned about sliding/conversion versions ESPECIALLY if the mechanism is fully enclosed in a shell."
1,Picking wrong
1,"The USB stick I received won't insert into a USB-C slot without using a lot of force, or not at all. The slide (to expose either the standard USB or USB-C end) jams repeatedly and is difficult to get working again.  I think the actual storage behavior is ok, but the mechanical aspects are poor."
1,"The USB-C connection isn't working for my unit. Stay away from this product. BTW, the transfer speed is also not impressive."
1,Pro: No adapter needed for new MacBook ProCon: Transfer speed looks to be around 10 MB/Sec (unlike the description that states 150 MB/s)
1,"Unfortunately I have many of these drives, however the ones that I got off amazon is defective in the way that the usb-c doesnt fit. You can jam it in to read it, but you feel as if you are breaking the port. Unfortunately, I missed my window to return them."
1,"I had moved all of my files to the drive using the app, and when I plugged it into my pc, it said it was corrupted, so I plugged it back into my phone, and it said there was 0 files on the drive. All of my personal images of my family trip are gone. Very unhappy and I wish I wouldn't have bought this thing. I am so angry right now."
1,Well not a good product it all of a sudden stopped working .
1,The port of the phone of the dusly flash drive does not fit.
1,"Something is wrong with this product.  My Microsoft Surface Book 2 transfers 30GB of data to my current USB flash drive  in about 22 minutes.  Backing up to this SanDisk Dual Drive USB Type-C took over 1 hour and 7 minutes, more than 3 times as long!!  It doesn't matter if the type C connector or regular USB connector side is used.  On-line recommendations for speeding up transfer did not work.  If you need a fast transfer speed, do not buy this product."
1,The USB-C side does not fit the ports in my MacBook Pro. It's loose and longer than the port's length. Writing speed is slow and I need to plug it in/out and try many ports to make it work and a very little movement will eject the FlashDrive. The worst USB device I have used ever!
1,Doesn’t fit what it says it will
1,Same as some of the other reviews . USB C does not work well (or at all) with Mac . Non-USB C side works fine with adapter but what is the point of a dual drive with one side that works . Disappointed and wish I would have seen comments regarding difficulty with Mac users .
1,Does not fit android charge port. Returned for refund
1,Fit my MAC but nothing happeded.  Couldnt down load etc.  Did not fit IPAD or Iphone.
1,"Love this but I must say that the USB-A connector doesn't hold steady on some ports. And now I'm finding that the I/O speed is horrible. When dealing with large files you really feel it. Sandisk isn't the best for sure, Samsung devices is far better vendor."
1,Failed after a few months of usage. Would not eject.
1,"Across a Mac Mini (2018) and a Macbook Pro, neither device recognizes this flash drive when plugged in via USB C. The Mac Mini sees it when connected via the standard USB port. Unfortunately, it's beyond slow. I purchased the 128gb version, and tried to copy about 27GB over to the flash drive. It was estimated to take 4-5 hours. Frankly that's unacceptable for a device like this in 2019."
1,"Not sure if my flash drive was defective, but the read and write speeds were slower than my USB 2.0 flash drive. I returned this product for a refund."
1,Typec is not capable for macbook pro
1,no supportObviously support is needed
1,"I tried it in all 3 USB C ports and it was too tight.  I was afraid to force it and mess up my ports on my brand new laptop.  I tried 5 or 6 other USB C devices and they all plugged in just fine with no force required.  It kinda had a ""rough/scratchy"" feeling to it when I tried to plug it in.  I am disappointed because I have used SanDisk products such as these almost exclusively for many, many years.  This is very small and a great design with lots of storage space, but not at the risk of ruining my laptop.  Returned it."
1,"The USB C side of the unit I received had some physical issue (bent pin?), which prevented me from plugging it in to the USB ports of any of my devices. Amazon is sending me a replacement unit, but not a great sign for SanDisk's manufacturing.When using the USB A port, I noticed that the drive got hot as others have mentioned."
1,"Tech support for ScanDisk is crap, after sending them photos of the flash drive i guess to prove i had one then was instructed to request a RMA, on their wed site. Instead of wasting my time they could have told me this up front. After minimal use the connectors will not lock into place so you can insert it into a usb port,"
1,"After only a few months, the USB C has stopped working. It does not register on my laptop or phone. Very disappointing!"
1,The slide mechanism no longer hold the drive in place.  Can not insert it into the drive slot on pc.  Useless now.
1,The product I received was faulty and suspiciously duplicate Check the transfer speed using a large file
1,"The drive gets very hot quickly, I had never seen something like this.I do not feel comfortable to keep it connected to my Mac."
1,"I've had this since February and used it about 5 times.  The type C connector is now stuck in the case.  The plastic is thin and overall it does not appear to be very sturdy.  Obviously so, since it's now stuck.  Definitely not worth $30 I paid."
1,"At first I was excited to get such universal drive. Then, I only had problems. (1) The accompanying app is ridiculous. It does not give you access to separate folders, but instead put everything in one pile. I have 10s of 1000ds of images and video on my S9+ with 256 Gb SD card and would only need a small subset to be managed. (2) it took several hours to copy 3 Gb of mixed content (video and images) (3) then windows stopped recognizing the drive at all. It does see it, but says it is ""write protected"". I reformatted it in the phone, no use. (4) so, now it is dead. I am glad I did not trust any files to this drive."
1,"With SanDisk I expect a great product, this however is not that product. The USB C side (why I purchased this drive) doesn't maintain connection. I've tried it with two different MacBooks and my Pixel 3, and only my Pixel 3 was able to register that it was connected, but only for about 5 seconds before disconnecting. Really disappointing to see something from SanDisk not work as expected.Even if it did work, I wouldn't trust the connection as the USB-C side doesn't connect flush with the port, making the connection flimsy to begin with."
1,"Drive just stopped working for no reason after 10 months of barely using it, usually just transferring files from one device to another. Really disappointed as I had tons of files on it and now every time I plug it into my PC it asks me to format it."
1,When transferring onto the flash drive it is half as slow as a normal USB 3.0 drive... very disappointed
1,Item broke first time i tried to use it.
1,Terrible product! I have an important data and it’s  broken lesser than a year also the support is slow and not responding.
1,It worked for a few months before going out. Waste of money.
1,"Worked on arrival, died about 3 days later. Unable to access the drive to erase it so I cannot return it because the disk still contains sensitive financial information.Trash."
1,Look for something more reliable. Write speeds are slow and it randomly stopped working and made me lose an hours work.
1,"After 4-months it no longer works, tried to open it on 2-pcs"
1,Crashed after ONE use. Lost all the pics and vids I stored on it. I spoke with Seagate support for literal hours (took forever!!) and they did say they could try to save lost files since the device was corrupted BUT I would not get refunded for the product but rather would be sent a replacement harddrive. I don't trust these harddrives at all after this one died almost instantly and after losing those pictures so I just returned to Amazon instead for a refund. I switched to an American made external harddrive. Will never purchase Seagate again. Built cheaply and poorly. Very disappointed! 10 year anniversary trip pictures and videos lost forever.
1,"It was working until one day, It gets corrupted and all of my games deleted and start over again. Not sure how that happened, so random"
1,It was too difficult to adapt to a Mac laptop.
1,"Seagate has a good reputation.  However...I've been struggling for a couple of days now with this drive working intermittently. Now, it will not work properly. The computer sees it, I can watch it connect in the message log (linux), then fail. It fails with Windows. Fortunately this was only going to be used for backups. I'd hate to waste the money on recovery, especially after wasting money on this.I'll be avoiding Seagate from now on."
1,"My drive arrived defective, as verified by Seagate technicians (online and via phone) in their repeated and unsuccessful attempts to reformat this to Mac computer."
1,"If I could give this product a negative star rating I would, to say this drive is fickle is an insult to fickle things everywhere. I can't go 5 minuets without it crashing and closing all open windows, doesn't matter if those windows are from the files on the drive or not. It really does not like idea of moving files, or opening files, or looking at the files Icon, opening a folder on another drive. Basically, if I do anything with folders on this drive I risk having to do a hard reboot of my computer. As soon as I can get another drive to move my folders to, this POS is becoming target practice, hopefully it will last that long and I won't loose all my data on it. I wouldn't even be heartless enough to give this to my ex-wife"
1,It’s stop working
1,Bought for my PS5 believing this would be fast. I was wrong. It is sore but it works. If your looking for fast transfer speed keep looking this isn’t it.
1,This is second time I bought a Seagate product that markets itself as “Mac Compatible.” I’m not a tech person so when I plug it in and then have to go through a formatting of the drive that is the first problem. Then the formatting didn’t go as planned and all of a sudden the drive is broken. If you are a Mac user I would suggest getting a drive that is Mac exclusive. You plug it in and it’s ready to go.
1,So only 2.5 years in and it will not mount in order to erase/repair/anything.  I have older external hard drives that are chugging right along.  I won't ever buy a seagate product again.
1,"I plugged this into my computer and followed the Seagate instructions on how to format it to my computer. Halfway through the process, it said that the drive was unrecognizable on my computer.  I tried plugging it into two other computers, same response. An hour later chat with customer service, they are sending me a replacement, but I have to pay the shipping to send the faulty one back. Will never purchase from this company again."
1,"I was very disappointed that not only does this product cost $7 shipping with no option for cheaper delivery to non-prime members, but this product doesn't even allow you to add password protection to the drive without paying $37 dollars to unlock software to do the most basic features.  Buyer beware."
1,Computers can see the device however the device will not accept and data. My IT team tried to get it to function properly with no success.
1,This hard drive failed after only one month of use.
1,"Bought this for my xbox and it doesnt work until i unplug it and plug it back in, now it kicks me off my games that are on the hard drive, terrible im going to try and get my money back"
1,"Literally, broke for a week of using it. If you travel a lot this is not ideal just buy yourself a shock proof portable HDD (SSD is my recommendation) if you happen to travel a lot. I think this is best when you are stationary in your room or something."
1,this hard drive is okay until 2 weeks because it decides to corrupt itself. its a very bad drive.
1,"I bought this product back in June, and it has been less than 3 months and after multiple issues, this external hdd has finally died on me. Every few weeks after getting it I would get an error message when trying to access it when plugged into my pc. Even when I only had two game files: League of Legends and Apex Legends on it. At first, troubleshooting the problem with Windows fixed it, but now it is no longer able to fix it. The hdd keeps freezing my windows file explorer, to the point I have to soft reset my pc to access anything. Do not buy you will waste your money having to buy another from a different brand later."
1,Bought this for my series x and the cord keeps coming lose from the hard drive.
1,"When I plug in the Hard drive, it only makes a low peeping sound on all of my computers.  Product is defective.  Please send me a new one.  I cannot return this hard drive because I am from Belize.I am forced to write this review because I cannot leave this comment at the right place."
1,Junk!!! Stay away from it. It’s my second purchase and I lost all 4 TB of data again. It just doesn’t work long term. I tried to store 171 GB and it just freezes and not detectable by computer. Wasted hours and money.
1,"It’s listed above that this hard drive is compatible with pc, Mac, ps4 and Xbox but it’s only compatible with pc and Mac, just a heads up."
1,"Stop working after 3 months. Don’t know how to get my files, and photos back. So frustrated!"
1,Just received this and started to transfer my photos with no problem.  Got up from the computer and walked by the drive and knocked it off the desk.  The cord came out of the external hard drive.  I plugged it back in and it is beeping.  The devise fell onto carpeted floor and was not damaged.  If this devise is thatdelicate I wouldn't trust it to hold all of my photos without some kind of problem developing.
1,Will not transfer Raw files. Just keeps crashing or freezing my entire system.
1,bought it in may worked fine till now i dont know what happened this morning woke up and the thing stopped working well my xbox stopped detecting it and lost over 10 games
1,"The drive worked well coming out of the box, though obviously slower than solid state drives.  After a bit over a month (just outside the return window!), it intermittently failed as my Time Machine backup drive.  I spent hours troubleshooting it before being told it's a problem with the drive.  We then spent an hour online and on the phone arranging a prompt replacement (otherwise waiting for a week or two).  With all that done, I should have just cut my losses, thrown it away, and bought some other brand.  Now I need to return this bricked drive and hope that my private data isn't compromised.  Very frustrating."
1,"It worked for 3 months, sitting on a desk, not moving. Then one day it just stopped turning on.There's not much more to say."
1,"I was really ripped off this time. Thanks for that. I paid over $100 USD on 08 August 2021 for this Seagate 5TB external hard drive. But, what I got was a 32GB external hard drive. I have 128GB thumb drives that cost me less than $20. This 5TB Seagate external hard drive is just a big black box with only 32GB. It's almost useless. Seagate should focus their efforts on producing an external hard drive that is actually 5TB instead of focusing on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. I would return this piece of junk but it would cost too much to do so and they probably would just keep it and not refund me because I'm not Woke. I will Not buy anything from Seagate again."
1,"The product would not allow us to back up. I finally decided to drag and drop everything over and after I did that when I tried to open the drive I got an error code saying.F:\is not accessible, the request failed due to a fatal device hardware error"
1,OBNOXIOUS CLICKING AND BEEPING SOUNDS!!!!!CORRUPTED FILES!!!!!!!!EXTREMELY SLOW WRITING SPEED!!!I ended miss placing the product packaging before using it and now I am unable to get my money back!
1,"I don't believe my eyes. This simply stopped working. I received it on mid July and in less than a month it is simply not recognized! no matter the Operating System, cables, etc. It started to make a beep noise while in use and... died."
1,"I  bought this and it failed after the 2nd day, so i replaced it with the same product.  CLICK OF DEATH out of the box.....this is junk!  don't buy!"
1,"I bought this hard drive to store my games and for the first couple of months it worked, but now my pc wont detect the hard drive and after a few hours of trouble shooting it I've giving up."
1,This feels nothing like my other Seagate externals
1,"2 months after receiving, drive failed. Had to send back to Seagate & am still waiting for replacement. Data couldn’t be recovered. Haven’t had a back up drive for months. Never buy a Seagate product again"
1,"I own a ton of hard drives, I store tons of video and photos. I’ve owned 3 of these and 2 of 3 have died within a year. Not sure if it’s recoverable. If you value your memories and children’s and family photos buy something else. Thing is they all seem to be a gamble."
1,Don't waste your time purchasing this drive. My drive failed after less than 6 months. I purchased this for a backup for my files. I will never purchase another seagate product again.
1,"If you have the latest software for the Mac, this external drive is not compatible. I was able to back up to it, but after a software upgrade I could no longer access the drive. I could not even add one Word document to it. I erased the back ups and reformatted the drive per online support after much time trying to trouble shoot without doing that. I was able to put one file on it so I set up a new back up. 4 hours later it said it was preparing the back up. When I tried to restart the back up, my computer no longer recognized the drive although I could see another file on it. I found info online finally about the incompatibility and that reformatting is not a fix. Now this unit is beyond warranty so I am stuck."
1,Not worth your money spend more to get something more reliable broke within a couple of months
1,"So this was money wasted, this hard drive isn’t compatible because it’s for Australia or other countries."
1,"I don't think I've ever written a review but this event made me make the effort. At least a decade of buying everything off of Amazon and this one really hit me in the gut. I guess you get what you pay for.I bought this Seagate drive 12 days ago. Had a bunch of data on it, most of which I backed up but not all of it. Today it died and I lost some very important data.Here is exactly how it happened. I have it plugged into my Mac by way of an Anker adapter. I have my Mac on my desk. As I slid the Mac from one part of the desk to the other, the drive and adapter fell off the table but did NOT hit the floor. It just dangled from the Mac.. that's it, that caused it to die. Confirmed with their support team.So think twice before you put your precious data on this device. It's delicate as hell compared to my old drive that has been around for 6 years, tossed in drawers, and dropped on the floor."
1,"Not sure if it’s not meant to reformat, but I can’t seem to reformat on my MacBook Air."
1,Don't get it. Simply don't get it.It's a scam and there's nothing inside but hollow plastic.DO NOT get it
1,defective
1,I rarely leave bad reviews. But I spent days backing up my files only to have lost everything once this was over 3TB. All was fine and then suddenly there was a corruption and it would not work. The hard drive had to be reformatted and I had to start over but many of the files on this were lost forever. I have put another half TB on it but I DONT TRUST THIS.  No more Seagates. A lot of people criticize Toshibas but so far they are the only external drives I have not had issues with.
1,"I bought the Seagate One Touch because of its high rating on a tech review site and also because it earned 4-1/2 stars here on Amazon. However, I started transferring 2TB of data to the drive over 24 hours ago and it indicates that it still has, ""about 6 hours"" to go! If I had known the write speed was this slow, I never would have purchased this drive. Buyer beware! Don't make the same mistake I did!"
1,"If you're going to advertise it as being compatible with the PS4, then the PS4 should be able to format the hard drive. It was unable to, and now I have to do it manually"
1,"Very disappointed with this hard drive. Please, look elsewhere."
1,Like: Sounded goodDislike: worthless.  Seems ok until it trys to authenticate.30-40 attempts.  Waste of time.  Same problem over and over.I read about the wireless wifi connection.This product should be taken off the amazon.com website.I should have thought this through given problems others had/have before.. Over and over.Dislike:  Amazon promotes this item.Dislike:  Amazon is dishonest selling this and other items over and over when they are Very Very Clearly aware of the problem.Problems.
1,"There are some instructions, not easy to find, on how to reformat this storage device for a Macintosh. However after well over 45 minutes of trying and numerous attempts I have not been successful. Into the trash it goes."
1,It took some time for me to notice or actually Samsung Galley said they would be cancelling their service and to download all photos to One Drive or an External hard drive.  And that’s when they informed me that my internal external SD card is corrupt.
1,"It has a terrible write speed and constantly disconnects itself, Look elsewhere."
1,This crashed on me in less than a year. Really disappointed. Lost all my back ups.do not buy.
1,"I purchased this a few weeks ago in hopes to store all my photography files since macbook air isn’t the best in terms of storage. I finally got some free time & tried to figure it out and first opening the box, I was impressed with how small it was for 2TB of data storage. I could not figure out for the life of me how to get this to store my files though. Its advertised as compatible for macs but opens up and immediately says its for windows but did say something about macs which confused me? Even with my boyfriends help, who is a computer nerd, we couldn’t figure out how to back up my files. This isn’t very user friendly and the lack of instructions didn’t help. I don’t have the time nor patience to sit here for hours trying to figure out how to do this so I’m pretty disappointed for having had wasted $60. If you aren’t computer savvy, I don’t recommend this, it’s more of a headache than anything."
1,"Barely touched this thing, I plug it in and the entire HDD is corrupted and isn't even recognized as a hard drive anymore."
1,"This drive is the worst external drive I’ve purchased to date. It constantly stalls, stops transfers and slows down my m1 mac mini. Waste of good money. Don’t BUY‼️ You’ve been warned."
1,"Broken on my pc, keeps disconnecting, Seagate's program detected many problems which were unfixable..."
1,"This is the second Seagate external HD I've bought over the past couple years, this one being only a month old and already it cannot be recognized by my Mac and will not allow backups. One bad drive is a fluke. 2 is a trend. Bye Seagate, it's just not working out."
1,I think the positive reviews came when people first got it.. But one quick google search and you will find out that these Seagates hard drives fail more than any other external drive within the first year. I got mine in  Feb and its July and cant transfer files onto it anymore.. I thought i needed USB drivers installed on my PC.. I was panicking.
1,"I loved it at first, but after having to attach the cable between three and five times, the pins in the drive are completely ruined. I am very disappointed. I didn't want to give it one star but you have to for the review to be posted."
1,"I am now on my second hard drive. My first one was completely corrupted from regular use. Seagate recovery services were great, I got all my files back, however, they took about a month and I had to pay to ship the HD. Now, having used the recovered drive I am currently experiencing the HD getting corrupted again... from almost no use and properly ejecting the HD. I am extremely frustrated and will never trust Seagate with my data again."
1,"I've had 4 portable externals in the last 10 years.  This is my first *anything* from Seagate, I will not purchase anything from them in the future.  Out of the 4 externals I've had, this is the only one that both A) feels cheaply made (weak feeling plastic case) and B) had ANY disk errors (even with heavy usage/poor handling and care).  I've used previous portables with little to no concern for their safety or well-being (thrown loosely into a packed bag, carried in pockets, left plugged into pc for a year+).  The portable caused me to lose ~20gigs of video on its first transfer to it.  Will be replacing as soon as financially viable."
1,We put files on it and a week later it died. Tech support was helpful. They said:  you have a bad drive. Send it back. Then the same thing happened to the other two drives we bought. AVOID SEAGATE.
1,I can't believe this... I have barely used this product for a month and it's already corrupt and lost all my data.  This is very unreliable and I will never purchase another one again.
1,"I was really looking forward to using this hard drive. Unfortunately, within the first week, I set it down to work just to hear a beeping sound from the hard drive and I can no longer access it. It had no major falls or drops...it just broke. I should have gone with the SSD."
1,"This drive is EXTREMELY SLOW, don't buy it.  I do a lot of video editing and this was painful to use.  On my Sandisk 2TB I could process a 10GB video in < 5 seconds, on this it is more like 45 seconds.  I suppose if you just need a drive for archive data or occasional use, this might work, but for actual regular use it's worthless."
1,Don't waste your money. Anytime I try to do anything with this drive it freezes my entire computer until I just have to unplug the drive. Downloading anything directly onto the drive is also painfully slow and not worth it (like 8 hours)
1,This showed uo as an external hard drive for my playstation and it doesnt even work
1,I’ve now had two of the 2TB hard drives that just stop working and I’ve lost over 50 games because of it
1,Says it works for Mac which is why I bought it. It doesn’t work for Mac. Look into it and now it says it works for Mac reformat. Terrible advertising!
1,Arrived Totally Dead.  It would not power up at all.  Tested it on multiple computers and with different USB cords.
1,"I bought this device back in September 2020 to add storage to my PS4.  The device worked fine until last night (07/08/2021) when it crapped out, and I lost all my saved storage.  I tried to reformat the device to pair with the PS4, but it continually gives me an error message.  I don't understand why the device will not reformat with my PS4.  Haven't even had the device a whole year, and it craps out on me."
1,Completely destroyed my computer + it doesn’t even work…. Worst $60 of my life….
1,Arrived Broken From Over seas Took 2 Months to get a refund…LOOK AT WEAR THE PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED FROM BEFORE YOU BUY…
1,"Worked great for 90 days, now it's dead!!!"
1,This hard drive has been giving me fits. Loading extremely slow and just freezing over and over. Completely unreliable at this point. Hoping to transfer everything off of it but this one is brand new and shouldn't be doing it.  I just missed my return window too.
1,"Had one that stopped working in 3 months, got it replaced lasted 4 months. But all around you get what you pay for it just doesnt last even close to a Year. tried formatting it DIDNT SHOW UP IN DISK MANAGER. kinda pissed but only buy this if you want a short term hard drive which most of you dont want"
1,"Failed during format.  Disk Utility, Disk Drill and Disk Warrior could not repair the disk.  Will be returning it asap."
1,Hard drive failed 6 months after purchase.
1,"I picked this hard drive up on a random sale, and in close to 1 month exactly it just gave out on me.  'Just beeps when I plug it in, not even my partitioning software sees it.I did nothing with it besides set it next to my PC and put files on it, and one day I get a Windows error and all the files I put on it/recorded to it are gone (until further notice, I'm not going to review above 1 Star just because I haven't paid to talk to data recovery yet?)"
1,ive had so many problems with it sometimes it doesn’t even work
1,This drive was great at first and worked well with my MacBook Pro. After 1 month it quit showing up as a portable drive and makes a beeping sound.  Very disappointed and can't locate my back-ups. Tried troubleshooting on seagate but that was a bust. Guess I'll have to send back to Seagate.
1,Works for 2 months after he dies I lost everything
1,Very difficult to use period!!
1,"It works reasonably well.  I have a MacBook Pro, and it converted reasonably seamlessly and did its first Time Machine backup in a few hours.  Well, I clicked on the order for some reason on Amazon, and up popped three notificatiosn on my desktop.  Keep in mind that all notifications are explicitly off on my device, and I receive an average of one notification a year.  Three.  Instantly.  I've never been more horrified by an obvious privacy violation.  Buy Seagate on Amazon at your own risk.  I'm not sure what their relationship is, but this is gross.  I'm going to return this out of sheer creeped-out-ed-ness."
1,This died after about 6 months
1,"I bought this July 2020 and it crashed last month.  I lost all of my pictures from 2020 and 2021.  Devistating.  Don't buy it, not worth it."
1,Only worked for a few days and now it no longer works or comes up.
1,"I neglected to read very far into the reviews as I figured it's a Seagate, how bad can it be? BAD! People complaining about slow write speeds aren't drunk, high or delusional. It's really that slow. Like glacier slow. This thing is useless for videos, photos, music...well, anything really. Will be returning and buying a LaCie."
1,"Stored one video on the drive, after a week it started beeping. Disk drive stopped spinning."
1,Device started beeping and no longer shows up on my Xbox
1,"Items delivered in plain brown boxes ,  possibly refurbished ?not new Seagate blister pack as in other Seagates I own. last one failed test, disconnected, andfailed both read test and S>A>R>T tests  .. read other feedback for similar expereinces"
1,The drive was a brick after I formatted was the bad news. The good news is that they gave me back money.
1,Very disappointed.  I tried to copy data and it stopped working.  I sent it back for a refund.
1,Running the latest Acronis True Image 2021 backup software.  Trying to create a Windows 10 Survival Bootable backup of my new Samsung PCIe 4 7000MB/s NVMe SSD drive.  Acronis repeatedly fails with file system error.  After killing that process Windows 10 does not find any problems but it will always fail.This drive is 25 months old and is out of warranty.  The problem is that it is only used as a backup and has only been used about 4 times for one day only in its entire life.  The rest of the time it is in storage and offline to prevent damage from virus or ransomware.The other drive of the same type and capacity is four years old but also died solid within two years.  The other failure is solid and just hangs.I will not be purchasing anymore Seagate small portable drives.
1,no
1,"i'm incredibly disappointed. i spent $68 on this and it arrived two days ago. on the first day, it worked fine, but on the second day it no longer showed up on my computer, it was as if it wasn't even plugged in, and this happened the SECOND DAY I HAD IT. i plan to get my money back"
1,Bad hard drive! Had it for about a month then it's starts freezing out of nowhere.  Keeps repairing itself now it stopped working!:(
1,Plugged it in. Wasn't found. I didn't want a device that I'd have to call tech support for.  Total waste of money.
1,"Broke at the second use. Transferred a whole bunch of files onto the drive and the second day it doesn't work anymore. The drive just doesn't show up on my computer anymore. Contacted customer service, did not know how to recover the files. Terrible product, look and feel very cheap."
1,"First it hated one of my usb ports. When plugged into the port, it interfered with my wireless mouse. So I plugged it in the back. It then seemed like it was trying to be a boot drive, interfering with startup, so I had to change this in the bios. This is the only drive I've owned that did this. That did not work though, and it still seemed to spin up and take forever to be recognized, causing windows explorer to crash.I  have gigs of 3d models to back up. I set it to backup the day before, and went to bed. In the morning it had only written about a quarter of the files to the 5 T drive. When I deleted a file off the drive, it hung, and would not mount.I spent all morning trying to get the drive to work, with file utilities, and no luck. I finally set it to reformat using a third-party utility. It now mounts again, but still seems like it 'takes over' when plugged in, and cannot use the front USB port.I'm returning it. There is something wrong with this drive. I just bought another brand of 5 T drive at best buy, and its not so quirky. I think this is a bad drive."
1,I purchased it just to back up some files and it functioned for 2 days and then decided to fail. This product no longer reads on my computer and the speed to download files is extremely long. I would not recommend.
1,"How... and WHY?I had this drive sitting around since the holidays. I finally got around to using it in May (I know, long time). My use was to copy all my art files from my PC before it goes into storage. My mistake was that I ""CUT"" and pasted to this drive.Even though it was connected through USB 3.0, the transfer was incredibly slow. Half the transfer was there, but then the transfer time skyrocketed. I canceled the transfer (I felt I could instantly pickup where I left off, because I copy/pasted, so no fear of duplicates). Trying to open any project files only locked up my computer or failed. Outside of a few MP3's all my files are lost and this was a NEW, not at all abused drive.It's nice that it is under warranty and Seagate will replace it. But if I want to recover anything they want to charge me... Umm, no. Your product f-ed up. How about this, you recover my drive's files, and keep the warrantied replacement (after we find a way for you to get me 3tb of art documents..... cloud?)This is acctually the THIRD failure of a Seagate drive within a year. One was out of warranty, the other they replaced... no more, never again will I buy another."
2,"i have been using this product for about 3 weeks, my nails are still peeling, no growth, and still very weak, no change in my nails, would not recommend this priduct"
2,There’s no change in my nails.
2,"My nails and cuticles are no better than before if I were to use any type of moisturizing emollient. For the price of this, it would be more cost effective to use Vaseline or my Mary Kay night time emollient. It does smell good, but for $11 and my nails/cuticles are no better than before, I’ll pass on purchasing another bottle of this."
2,I WILL USE IT AFTER THE DISHES. IT SMELLS LIKE HELL. I WILL NOT BUY AGAIN.
2,This isn’t helping
2,"Not thick enough; it goes on watery and doesn’t seem to penetrate well. Used it for a month, twice a day, and it didn’t really help to harden my nails. Maybe it’s just me, it could work for you. Who knows. I think I’ll go back to Healthy Hoof, that does the job and it’s cheaper."
2,Nothing special.. hasn’t  soften or done anything to cuticles.. nails no different!
2,"This has a nice non-greasy creamy consistency. It has a very pleasant mildly coconut-type scent. I had high hopes for this to strengthen my nails. However, it irritates my cuticles. After rubbing in and massaging nails and cuticles, the next day the cuticles were hard, peeling and painful.The type of hardness and pain that requires using a nail nipper to cut away.  I continued to try it without success. I thought perhaps it was just a problem for me, so I had a friend try it and after one application, experienced the same loose hangnail type cuticles. Perhaps it will work for others, but fir me, the pain just does not make it worthwhile to continue using."
2,Didn’t help my nails at all
2,I have been using this everyday sometimes twice a day and if anything my nails are worse.DO NO RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT!!!!
2,I am on my third jar of this product. I love the scent and texture and I'm sure that any softening agent you put on your nail can only be a plus purely for moisturizing sake. But my hard to grow and easy to split nails have seen no real measurable change or growth. I am on my third and probably last jar if there is no improvement. Very disappointing but not unexpected.
2,Did nothing to improve my nail quality.
2,"I haven't used enough to see if it helps nails, because it has a strange odor I don't like."
2,"I've been using this product for 4 months now.  I rub it on my cuticles and nails twice a day, and while it moisturizes my cuticles, so they aren't as dry and jagged, they are still peeling in the corners, and it's done absolutely Nothing to strengthen my nails...they are still peeling and breaking! Granted, I have terrible nails and not even nail hardeners/strengtheners help them grow, I thought this would help, because of its good ratings, and has coconut oil in it, which smells strongly of coconut, so be aware if you don't like that smell, because you won't like this.  I am disappointed."
2,First of all. Who has time to apply 3x a day. It’s too greasy. I was consistent for about a month and still no results. Not even a little. Not worth the money
2,It may work... But smelled so bad i couldnt keep it.
2,No effect on my nails at all.
2,"Unfortunately, this product did the opposite of what it was supposed to for me personally. I tried it out for about a week using as directed but every time after I put it on my nails they would become dry and brittle and started breaking."
2,"I don’t know if this stuff works because it smells so strong, I refuse to use it any longer. My husband hates the smell also, he can smell it instantly when I walk into a room even though it’s been an hour since over put it on. Also fragrance can be toxic, why include it in the first place. Unnecessary and I’m disappointed."
2,Used twice a day for six weeks and have sadly seen no difference.
2,"Well, I am disappointed. I was hoping this would work. After using 3 times a day for about 3 weeks, my nails have actually gotten worse."
2,"Purchased because of a buzzfeed article. This works to help your nails grow faster, but does not make them stronger as the name suggests."
2,"Smells great, but this did the opposite my nails became weak :("
2,Didn't do anything. Product was sticky feeling.  I didn't see any benefits to nails at all.
2,Not as amazing as everyone else seems to think. It’s fine. Nothing special.
2,"OMG smell too strong horrible! also,It caused me severe allergy."
2,"No change in my nails strength, disappointed."
2,Feel like waste of money did follow instructions and all I felt I was doing was greasing my fingertips very much.
2,This did not work at all. It did not help strengthen or grow my nails in the least.
2,I HAVE BEEN WANTING TO TRY THIS FOR A LONG TIME. SO IT WAS ANXIOUSLY AWAITED. OPENED JAR & TEXTURE OF LOTION WAS VERY THICK & CREAMY. PUT A SMALL DAB ON EACH FINGERNAIL & MASSAGED A LITTLE IN TO EACH ONE. BUT WITHING 5-10 SECONDS MY HANDS GOT THIS HORRIBLE AROMA & EVEN MY PUP STARTED SNIFFING ME. YUCK. HAD TO WASH IT OF WITH DISH SOAP  2 X. TRIED IT AGAIN FEW DAY LATER & SAME ODOR. SO IT IS IN MY 'WHAT WERE YOU THINKING' SPOT.  IT MUST WORK BUT CANNOT GET PASS THE SMELL. SO SORRY BECAUSE I REALLY NEED A GREAT MOISTURE FOR HANDS & NAILS.
2,I did not notice any difference after using Hard as Hoofs. My nails have continued to rip and shred. I was very disappointed.
2,Have relatively thin fingernails subject to tears and other damage.  Thought this product might offer some relief.  Used half the product and saw no change in the nails.  Shelved the rest.
2,"I bought this after reading positive reviews.  The product is pleasant to use, but its effect is no different from any cuticle cream: it softens your cuticles for a while.  As far as strengthening weak nails -- no effect at all.  😢"
2,Not too good. Wouldn’t order again. Didn’t work for me.
2,"It did not work for me. Feels moisturizing, but it did not prevent my nails from constantly chipping or breaking any more than they always have. With consistent use, my nails were no stronger."
2,Used twice a day but did nothing to help my nails grow.  Maybe it's because I had taken my acrylics off.
2,Smells horrible
2,"The instructions say to massage this product up to 3x a day on your nails - who has the time. I think people who don't work and have so much time on their hands (and paid bloggers) - gives 5 stars. My daughter used it for a couple of weeks so far and it's not living up to the hype. Coconut scent. Overall, not worth the cost and time."
2,"I did not notice a difference. It does a good job to moisturize nailbed but it did not strengthen my nails. Also, the instructions say to use three times a day. That is an indication it does not work. I use vitamins that I found more results in. I would not purchase this again nor recommend."
2,Doesn't have a smell... I used it as directed on the container but I did not see any major or even minor differences because of this product so I stopped using it.. Am I doing something wrong? Or is the product just not good?
2,I’ve been using on my nails for about a month and nothing has changed.  They are still brittle and this product has done nothing to improve that.
2,I have been using this for 3 weeks and have not seen a difference. It’s an ok moisturizer if you have dry cuticles but nothing special
2,Saw absolutely NO improvement in my nails. Don’t waste your money.
2,My nails didn’t grow. Smells good tho
2,Nothing special.  I bought to use for damaged nails due to long usage of polish.  It didn't help one way or the other.  Took my nails 4 months to clear up using nothing.  I used this product for 1 month and all it did was make my nails greasy.
2,"Was great when I started using it, but when I missed a day or so my cuticles cracked and split my nails became more brittle than they were before.I stopped becyi started havtan allergic reaction"
2,"Well, while this stuff smells nice. It’s greasy. Makes nails grow quickly. But what good is that when they aren’t helping with strength at all and they break. I’m constantly cutting them down supper short because they are so paper thin that they break. This product doesn’t make them strong."
2,"This stuff smells awful. It's greasy, doesn't absorb well, and is so intensely perfumed that it's unuseable. I wanted and needed it to be a good product, but it's a waste of money for me. Sorry."
2,My nails are very brittle. I found no difference using this except a moisturizing effect. Still brittle and peeling nails
2,This didn't work as I thought it would. In fact after starting to use it my nails started to break straight up into the cuticles. Not a favorite and would not purchase it again.
2,"I've been using this for about 6 weeks, per package instructions. Not only have my nails and cuticles not improved, but my nails also seem even softer and more prone to tearing than before."
2,Made my nails too hard and brittle now each one is breaking off simply when my nails bang into anything.
2,"This made my Nails pretty weak, wouldn’t recommend."
2,Liked the cream but it didn’t help my nails at all...was disappointed...my nails are thin and keep breaking...
2,"Does not work that well with my cracks/cuts and is sticky feeling, does not absorb well."
2,This was supposed to moisturize and keep her nails from breaking but it did neither and was a total waste of money.
2,Maybe have not used longenough but I thought it was suppose to keep nails from peeling!It caused mine to peel 2 layers and poof no nails at all!! Scared to use the product any longer!Have I wanted my money?
2,"I would have returned but would have to pay the shipping. Not worth it. Product ok, helped a bit with cuticles but not much. And did nothing for the condition of my nails."
2,I've been using this product as often as I can but haven't seen any difference on my nails :(
2,I didn’t like the chemical smell. I threw it away after maybe 5 uses.
2,I had high hopes for this product but it did nothing to improve the condition of my nails. I don't recommend it.
2,"I have horrible fingernails, so I've been searching for something to help, but this unfortunately did not seem to help at all unfortunately."
2,I found no difference in this product compared to over the counter products
2,Doesn't live up to the hype. Smell is terrible too. Didn't make a bit of difference.
2,I noticed no difference in my nails after the use and not something I will purchase again.
2,I am not sure if this stuff works or not.  I find the scent overpowering and unpleasant.  I've used it exactly twice.
2,"I bought this set a long with the color 010 and was obsessed. It went on so easily and it lasted so much longer than my Gelish polishes. However… I noticed it was really hard to take off. Even after soaking in acetone cotton balls with aluminum wrapped around my fingers for 20+ minutes, it would barely come off. I was eventually able to get it off and I redid my nails. This time, I noticed the top of my nail polish was chipping and my actual nail was splitting. All of my nails started breaking super low and became incredibly thin. I’ve always had super strong nail beds and no issues with peeing or breaking until I used this product. I had to put bandaids around my fingertips to keep my nails from splitting lower and because they hurt two bad when hot water touched them. So yes… it is very easy to use and stays on well for the most part. But after a few uses it does a lot of damage to the nail."
2,"I loved this product the first time I bought it, then I decided to order again, and the second time it sucked. So sad."
2,"I used it the first time and it worked real good! but the second time was horrible, I could not get it to set correctly, it was in a way clumpy? it sucks because I really wanted to like it."
2,It claims that it’s a no wipe top coat but cured it for more than 2 mins and still stays sticky and the shine it’s just not there for me.
2,I did not like the smell of the product
2,The gel is too thick with this product. Not very easy to work with. Even for beginners. I would not recommend.
2,Not good
2,Sorry that I have to write this review but this was a waste of money. It is too thick for my taste. I will not be ordering this again
2,Smells really bad I just leave there never use again .
2,Looked awful. My gel polish looked pitted after use
2,"Ver poor quality ,pools in the corner of your nails. Don’t waste your money!"
2,"The Base coat pools in the middle of your nail, so there is a bad adhesion and makes the product clumpy. The top coat is fine, but the base coat makes application uneven. Really dissapointed"
2,Horrible smell to it.
2,The base coat works well but the top coat literally will not go on without gaps and separating. I’ve never had this problem with any other top coat! So bummed.
2,Top coat polish peels off too soon. It peels separate from the polish. Poor quality.
2,Nail color peels right off. Disappointed as gel nails are meant to last longer and within 3 days or sooner I could peel off the paint.
2,"It did not cure well for me, not very shinny, and the shine it did have did not last very long."
2,I couldn’t get over the smell! It was so bad that I couldn’t finish my nails.
2,The product itself works very well but I'm highly allergic to this product 😭
2,"after putting on the base coat, indents appeared so the base wasn't smooth at all. had to examine it really closely before putting on the color i wanted and hard to fix."
2,"Even though it is a bit thick to apply, the top coat works great, this was my second bottle of it.  I just hate they they leak anytime they aren't perfectly right - and it is a pain to clean up on easy surfaces.  My problem is with the base coat, which is pure crap.  It ruined 3 different manicures!"
2,"Sadly I didn't receive the same quality that everyone else seemed to receive. Mine was thick, goopy, and had clumps in it."
2,Bad quality
2,Patchy and globby? I try to put the thinnest coat possible and it look smooth. I put it to cure and then it no longer is flat and smooth. Starts gaping so when the other gel polish goes on it is not great and bumpy.Top coat is ok. Does the job but also thick...I thought it may be my lamp that was failing so I got the Madam glam gel base coat and tested it! Madam Glam is so worth it! Very smooth and can get a thin base!Highly recommended Madam glam base coat and their no wipe top coat!
2,I have ordered this before and loved it but the ones I received have been turning my nails an ugly nude color no matter what color of polish I have on. Will not be purchasing from this seller again.
2,TINY BOTTLES!!! ☹️
2,"I bought the base and top coat, in addition to the nail polish and the UV dryer.  I returned all. The base coat came on glumpy plus it remains very sticky until you wipe it lightly with the nail polish remover(?) after drying.  I cant tell you about the top coat bc the 2 times I used this I took the polish off.  I know that it can be a combo of a bad base coat, or bad polish, or an insufficient dryer.  I think this was all three"
2,Smells like it’s gone rotten or something.
2,Stays tacky forever and doesn't cure like others I've used!
2,"Hello!I don’t know what to do now but my nails have gotten really damaged, chipped and very thin from using it only twice, I did not expect this to happen. My nails will need to recover from what the harsh chemicals caused."
2,Unfortunately I had an allergic reaction to this brand (all 10 of my finger tips blistered and itched for nearly two months aftwr initial use). I had to switch to much more expensive brand CND.
2,"The top coat seems to work ok, but the base coat is really tough. It doesn’t go on evenly, bubbles up a lot. I’ve had some nails peel off in a day and the rest are uneven looking"
2,"the top coat seems to separate from the color coat. i applied the top coat after the color coat and made sure that it was even and not too thick. after being under the uv/led light it looked blotchy. if u try to apply another coat or keep it under the light for more time it just makes it worse. if u do buy it, one thin coat is best but it probably won’t be perfect. it’s not super noticeable, but i knew it wasn’t right  and it bothered me. bought a different brand base and top coat and the problem was solved."
2,The top oat sucks!
2,"I have used this 1 time on fake nails, it worked just fine. But as other reviews state the smell is bad, the top coat is really thick making it hard to apply  a thin layer. Confused to when do I wipe off with alcohol. The base coat felt sticky, but so did the top coat (wiped both with alcohol)."
2,"I wanted to like this product especially with the no wipe top coat but no matter what I did (thinner coats, thicker coats, more curing time under the LED lamp) the polish would peel off within a few days. I have been using gel polish for years now and haven't had the polish peel off until I started using this. I'm going back to the Gelish brand that has always worked for me."
2,"I have had three problems with this product.  The first time I used it, it performed beautifully.  The second time, little black flecks from the cap had begun to come off into the top coat.  Also I couldn't get the top coat to spread smoothly, instead it left little gaps that I then had to try to fill it.  It seemed like it was maybe too dry.  Today the top coat behaved the same way but as I was using it, suddenly the brush became hard.  It was like applying polish with a stick. Needless to say my nails look ridiculous.  I've followed all the instructions and closed the bottles immediately after using.  I guess the product is no good and I will have to buy something different."
2,When i got the nail polish and opened it there was a thick slimmy coat on the instructions paper and i didnt know what it was after reading the instructions i took a look at the nail polish and it was actually the top coat that had leaked. So now i dont know how much product was really wasted and is left in the bottle.
2,Don’t care for the smell. Wouldn’t repurchase. Base coat sucks. Top coat is OK. Leaves a sticky layer behind for it to be a “No wipe”
2,"applies and cures well, but dulls your manicure significantly. Also the base coat is difficult to remove."
2,"not great, the application is weird, it does not go over the nail right, it creates spots where the nail is not covered (imagine oil). I do not know what causes it but the application is not as easy as it should be and removal is impossible, which one would think is a good thing, but it is not great when you have to gouge your nail to remove the leftovers after several weeks, even after soaking for at least 15 minutes in the remover. But for the time your nails hasn't grown yet and you've managed to apply it ; it does stick, you just need to wait for you nails to grow completely out."
2,The finished look is great. But for some reason it makes every single kind of gel polish color ive tried just peel off within 2-3 days its so annoying having to redo one or two nails over and over.
2,This came and was leaking.  I cannot read the directions because one of these leaked in the box.
2,This is NOT!! a good product.  The smell is horrible and it doesn't dry well under the light.
2,The smell is pretty bad
2,"I have developed a terrible reaction to this polish. My fingertips are blistering, skin is pleeling and my fingers are itchy and painful. I've used this brand in the past without issue, but the texture seemed more watery this time. Very disappointed."
2,smells awful
2,"The base coat works well enough but the top coat is awful. Leaves bubbles, little indents, and takes longer to cure. It looks horrible compared to my china glaze gel top coat. I don't recommend this."
2,Don't love -- been using Gelish for years. This doesn't seem to last as long and top coat doesn't go on and stay flat (bubbles sometimes)
2,"The top coat seems ok, but the base coat does NOT come off -- the seller responds to a question about this above by saying that they changed the base coat formula ""to last longer"" and that it will come off with more time in acetone but this is false. It does not soften with acetone. Additionally, it stained my nails yellow after one use. What the hell?"
2,Difficult to get to set.  Usually have to leave nails under the LED light for 5 minutes or more.
2,A little on the thin side ...which was a little messy. I'll give them one more try.
2,Base is not good. Top coat does cure pretty quickly but they really don't help the gel stay on longer as my gel chipped the next day. Was pretty annoyed at that.
2,"Terrible product. The base coat seemed to work fine, but the top coat was in such a gel-like consistency that I couldn't even use it. No matter how hard I shook the bottle up, it remained the same. Waste of money. Only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the base coat worked. All in all, NOT HAPPY!!!"
2,"Don't like it , chips & flakes off aweful !!!!!!!!!"
2,"Was hoping this would work but after 2 times I'll order something else. I followed the directions to a T but polish never set. Luckily it didn't come off and eventually dried but not what I hoped for. BTW I used AIMEILI top, Polish and bottom brand."
2,"I found the aimeili polish had good longevity, but it absolutely ruined both mine and my daughters nails.  Took layers of our nails off despite prolonged soaking to remove the polish."
2,Similar to other reviews I had an adverse reaction which caused blisters under my nails. Please look elsewhere for gel polish!
2,"I was really sad to see that the top coat has clumps of clear “booger” like product inside.  Was very hard to have a smooth top coat without having to use tweezers to remove it.  Ive done about two sets of nails with the top coat, almost everytime i dipped the brush back in a clump would come out.  I store this product with my other nail products in a box at room temperature.Im unsure if I’ll order from this brand again since i have similar issues with a gel polish in a colour."
2,"As the title says, Its fine, but I'm upset with the application. It holds up okay, I use it with non-gel nail polish so I think that's why it doesn't last as long as it advertises. What I am upset about is that the application brush for the top coat has hardened completely and I have only had these for about 2 weeks max. It renders the brush almost completely useless for application of the top coat, and is extremely upsetting since I've had it for such a short time. I would expect this if I had it for maybe a couple months and I left the lid open, but this is just insane to me. I am not sure if its just the bottle I got, or it somehow got exposed to my UV Lamp (I highly doubt it, but there's always that chance).I am going to try and revive the brush by soaking the bristles in acetone to soak off the hardened polish, so if that works I'll update this. Over all, not extremely happy, but it gets the job done for when I work in my restaurant job."
2,"I ordered in July 2020, now in March 2021 the polishes seem to have dried up and become clumpy.I’ve don’t my nails about 10-15 times with this base and top coat. A bit disappointing that they dry out. Coloured polishes from this brand have dried out as well"
2,Product takes a long time to dry. Had to redo my nails after first attempt with it. Unsure if I'd by again.
2,Horrible product. Does not stay on. The top coat has a thick glue like consistency and does not spread on nail well. Peels off within a couple of days. So disappointed.
2,Not the best coats. But it does the job for the price.
2,"The products work alright as far as what they're designed for - the base gel is does provide a good base, but the top coat is a bit difficult to get to level unless you gob on a really thick coat and wait maybe a minute or two for it to self level (it's much slower to do this compared to other top coats I've used and is very prone to streaks/other imperfections in the finish if you're not extremely careful).However, the biggest issue is the skin irritation these create. I have very tough skin that rarely if ever reacts to things, but my fingers ITCH UNCONTROLLABLY for days and days after using these. It's unbearable, and I can only imagine the kind of reaction this could provoke for someone with sensitive skin. The package directions even say to avoid skin contact, which should have been a red flag for something being used adjacent to skin. I've used myriad other gel polishes, and this is the only one I've ever had an issue with."
2,"The top coat works fine, reasonably sized bottles, but unfortunately no matter how long I tried to cure, the base coat will not dry at all. I tried over 3 minutes. I would not buy again for this reason."
2,"I like this product but seems sticky and I can literally peel my shellac off with this, not the best product out there but will still get the job done"
2,"I have the Aimilee UV light lamp, so bought the gel colour package as well. The sh** does NOT dry evenly, even after ten minutes under the lamp, with the top coat....I obviously got a bad batch. Only one colour dried, which was ironically, my least favourite."
2,It's okay. Not the best piled off my nails somehow worked on my toenails.
2,"As my picture shows, package is damaged. Two bottles inside has oily finger prints.Feels like used."
2,"The base coat works quite well (difficult to remove it though), but after 1 or 2 uses the top coat doesn’t work very well at all. It bubbles like crazy leaving a polka dot texture,  and my nails start chipping after 4 or 5 days of wear. Would not recommend."
2,The top coat bottle came in empty. That was very disappointing. Feel like a lost money here.
2,"I was so excited about finding a cheaper alternative to the Sally Hansen brand - but the first time I stuck my hands in any water, the top coat chipped right off and looked awful. Also took a long time to cure."
2,Not the greatest.
2,"The toenail clippers are fine.  The smaller fingernail clipper is half dull; one side is sharp and cuts well, but the other side is noticeably less sharp.  Based on the other reviews, I think I may have gotten a lemon.**Update 9-2-21:  I contacted the manufacturer and they're sending a replacement.  I'll update this review once I get the new clippers and make sure they work properly."
2,Not as easy or precise as I thought
2,"After many years of life experience, I am a bit advocate of life experience, and you get what you pay for.  I was initially pleased with my Harperton Nail Clipper Set - 2 pack.  But both of the set failed with in  a year. I would not recommend."
2,Not that good at trimming.
2,Bought due to the great reviews & sadly disappointed; back to Revlon’s nail clippers.
2,Not that great
2,I am a bit disappointed after having read the rave reviews online. I can’t see that the clippers are any better then the ones I get at the drugstore.
2,"These are the dullest nail clippers that I have ever used, I have gotten better clippers from the dollar store.  I really have to struggle to get them to work and they don't even give me a clean cut.  I had to file my nails after I cut them."
2,I didn't give it an average 3 because it costs slightly more.  These clippers weren't very sharp to begin with.  Other comments were right about them dulled out in couple of months.  It'll start to bent nails leaving that sharp edge.  It also wouldn't cut the small little jagged edges without considerable amount of effort.  The blades actually slide out instead of cut through close cuts that are needed to round off the nails.  Looks like the over 10yr old made in Japan clipper I got from Narita Airport will have to keep serving us until I find a good replacement.  Lifetime warranty is against defects not wear.
2,Small pair went dull and in the garbage after 3 years
2,Expected a superlative product for the price.  Would have been disappointed at even a third of the price I paid.  La Crosse items at the local CVS store is better.
2,They look nice but are not any easier to use or sharper than cheaper ones I’ve purchased. Disappointed for the price.
2,Doesn't clip very well
2,They don’t work great. No better than $2 ones from the local department store. Would not recommend
2,"Does not cut evenly, cumbersome to work with. It causes an temporary indention and soreness on the finger applying the pressure to cut the nail."
2,It  often fails to cut normal toenails even after lengthy soaking of feet! no better than inexpensive old store bought ones
2,Smaller clipper broke after two weeks...
2,they broke after a few uses
2,"These clippers seem to be on the small side, not really useful if you have large hands. They don’t seem to be any sharper than the cheap ones you can buy in the drugstore."
2,"I have a toenail clipper that I use for fingers and toes.  It was purchased about 10 years ago.  I thought it was time to upgrade and get a new one with an ultra sharp edge.  Just the opposite....The new ones that I purchased are such a disappointment.  They feel like they are 10 years old and have cut through some wire alone the way, yet, they are brand new.  My old ones cut like a scalpel compared to these.  Don't buy them!!!"
2,"I'd never paid more than a couple of bucks for nail clippers before purchasing this set.  I really liked these clippers until the smaller one broke this morning -- less than 20 months of occasional use by 2 adults and a child.You can't really see in the pictures, but the lever is attached to the pin by a pressed-in wire, and it looks like that wire worked loose and bent.  I'm obviously not sure if this is a common failure, but I believe I'll be going back to the cheapo clippers from now on."
2,"There is nothing special about these. The big one doesn’t work at all, so I don’t use it. The little one works OK."
2,Over priced and the angle required to use clippers blocks visual of process. Buy cheap drugstore clippers.
2,Not a very good clipper
2,"It really seems these 5star ratings may be ‘manufactured’ The Cut is feels forced. As if the blades are blunt. Bad line up of blades.Also, Couldn't remove Film off file.Standard Revlon or drugstore clippers seem much better value."
2,After 15 months they are obviously getting dull and no longer cut as easily or precisely. Not recommended for that reason.
2,"Sharp and sturdy, but I struggle to get the nail between the blades, so I tend to grab my older clippers instead. Never had that issue with other brands."
2,"These are decent and they seem to cut straight, but the file on them is basically useless, as it's in the very center and nowhere around the edge to get under your nails.It doesn't cut as smooth as I would prefer, but it's OK."
2,The fingernail clippers click twice when cutting fingernails. The finish is coming off of the handle.
2,They are not easy to maneuver and I do not like they way they cut.  The nail is sharp after cutting?
2,"I have purchased it the nail clipper as in NEW condition, however, it comes with seal opened. For a personal item like this, it is very uncomfortable to use as it may have been returned or used by someone else."
2,"Pros: - Attractive design. - Integrated file (though this is also kind of a con--see below).Cons: - The body of the clippers has sharp edges with no machining or rounding. This design element plays into the industrial-chic look, but it makes the clippers feel terrible to hold--every corner feels like the edge of a very dull knife. - The integrated file is useful, but also contributes to the discomfort--your finger or thumb is bound to come into contact with it while cutting your nails. The file should have been on the underside of the lever when it's swiveled up in position for use. - Finally, and most critically, these clippers occasionally have a weird ""double click"" when clipping a nail--usually tougher/thicker nails. It's hard to describe, but it feels awful. It's clearly a defect in the way the clippers operate. It's like they're not cutting cleanly through the nail, but getting hung up or twisted somehow.These problems makes the clippers completely unpleasant to use. I realized after getting these clippers that I started to dread having to cut my nails, whereas I used to find it a nice relaxing self-grooming ritual."
2,Good looking clippers but are dull!
2,I have not used this nailclipper set yet because it looks used.  The metal has scratches all over it.  The nail clippers were not positioned in the box it comes in.  Rather it looks like 2 clippers were just dropped in a box.  The box was not sealed.  I am not happy with this purchase.
2,Overall this is a very well manufactured product but the edge design for the cutters is bulky and weird.  It's hard to describe but it just feels like the cutters themselves are overly thick and at an odd angle that makes it kind of uncomfortable to cut your nails with...  not recommended.  They arent terrible but your avg pair from the drugstore are probably better.
2,Not sharp enough. There cutting edges were misaligned. Disappointed.
2,Disappointed in these clippers.  Either the cutting edges are not sharp enough or the piece that I push on with my thumb to make the cut is too flexible.  They didn't work for me.
2,The cutters do not cut cleanly.  Leave broken edge on nails cut.  Jaws don't open wide enough to accept toenails.  Overall a very very overrated product at a high misleading price.  I was late using the product.
2,Seem like nice clippers but smaller ones have already broken.
2,"Maybe my purchase was defective, however the top and bottom blades don’t align when depressed. I don’t get a clean cut. I’ve reverted back to my $2.00 drug store brand pair instead."
2,"I started shopping for clippers that hold the clippings.  Somehow, I wound up ordering these and I wish I hadn't.  Not just because they don;t hold clippings but because they have no advantage over the typical corner store clippers other than a slightly fancier finish.  I find absolutely no reason to pay three times as much for these clippers.  They work just like the cheap ones."
2,"The blades are sharp and the grip itself feels good, everything else I didn’t like. The design is a little awkward. I think the primary issue is the curvature and angle of the cutting blades. They are not easy to maneuver and I constantly make small cuts in the surrounding skin. The built-in file is too embedded in the handle and it makes it difficult to quickly file nails. The quality isn’t great either. The small file is glued on and mine fell off the smaller cutters.Keep looking for something better."
2,"I have arthritic hands.  Finger and toe nail cutting is therefore quite painful, so I was looking for clippers designed to reduce the force required to clip.  This product was not helpful in that regard, especially for the price.  In fact, the clippers did not work as well, requiring much more force than cheaper ones I have had for 50+ years."
2,Not as Advertised.  No easier to hold than my previous...AND...They don't cut as cleanly.  Will return if possible.
2,"Bought this to replace me super old not sharp pair. I wanted something very sharped and aligned. However, this haperton nail clippers are just as bad as my old ones. Unfortunately they are very uneven so I can't get a clear cut."
2,"The clipper blades don't line up, so the cut isn't clean."
2,I started out loving these set because they were so sharp but it only lasted about 20 clippings and then it was so dull I wanted to throw them away.  I only paid this amount of money because I thought it would last at least as long as the REVLON ones I had bought.  They lasted and stayed sharp for 10 years.  I hate waste and I do not like to constantly consume things so for me they were a big disappointment.
2,Uhm...these aren't that good. My 15 year old Nautica clipper set is better. I'll give them one more try.... probably will return.
2,"The finger nail clippers work fine, but the larger toe nail clippers worked less well. They seemed to have trouble cutting or perhaps were not as sharp as they could have been. For the price I was disappointed bc these did not do any better than the TRIM brand I also have and cost about 4 dollars at the big box pharmacy."
2,"Too large, no nail cleaner, file too small. Not happy with this purchase at all."
2,"The large clipper was not sharp at all, the small clippers, mah. Not happy with this set and went back to my old ones."
2,Not good....
2,Disappointed in this product scent doesn't last out of the bathroom to the bedroom let alone until you get out of the house
2,This item messed up multiple of my clothes due to it staining with oily substances. I tried to work around it by spraying on my wrists but it’s too oily to do that. Worst part is the scent doesnt stay unfortunately.
2,Don't waist your time and money on this crap!
2,"Basic smell, not a fan."
2,Liked the smell but the longevity is very short. 😩
2,Wife hates the smell. Had no positive affect
2,Waste of time didn’t do anything
2,I don’t know if this works or not but I really didn’t like the smell. It could just be me. Smelt masculine and sporty but a little flowery underneath. Not strong but just enough to annoy me.
2,Weak
2,Smells great but the container leaks really bad and with every use you get it all over your hands and it can make oil stains on you clothes if it drips on it
2,There isn’t any depth to this scent. Only lemon. $30 for 30ml of D level juice? No thank you. At that price you could buy a 100ml clone of a high end fragrance.
2,Not sure what I expected it to do!
2,"I saw so many good reviews and also reviews online on this product until I realized that this thing is a big scam. Here are the reasons:1. Packaging isn't bad, but the bottle i received has a very tiny crack that's not noticeable by eyes but somehow leaks tiny bits of oil if i put it side ways.2. Scent is above average, but nothing exciting at all. Just a very faint  musky scent.3. The longevity and range of this thing is horrific. Even if I spray it directly on my hands, I can't even smell it if I don't put my hands in front of my face. This means that the scent is so faint that unless you hug someone, or stick your neck, body or hand in their nose they won't even tell there is a scent on you.4. The faint smell is one thing and the scent only lasts like 30 mins to 1 hour. NO WHERE NEAR 6 hours they claimed to be.5. I do not know about pheromone part and I honestly did not buy it for the pheromone specifically. But then if this thing's scent and longevity is so weak I highly doubt it has any real effects.I don't know if my product is fake or defective or something, but this is a pretty overrated and disappointing product. You can find better colognes that smells nice, and lasts longer within the same price range"
2,Not impressed with scent ..
2,The cap for this fell apart during normal use. The two parts with the spring between them came separated and it spilled out. Very frustrated bc the bottle didn’t contain very much fluid. Smells good though.
2,I can barely smell it. It’s an oily hot mess; even stained my dress shirt.
2,Not recommend
2,"Lasts mins, can't attract a fly"
2,"The scent is ok, but didn’t react with my wife as I thought it would.i accidentally got some on my shirt and it permanently stained it."
2,"It smells great but does not last long and unless you're on top of it, like sticking your nose on it...you do not smell it🤔🙁 very disappointed"
2,No difference noticed
2,Smell good not attractive like others stuff i bought
2,Don’t like at all the smell hardly stays for hours
2,This product did not do anything.  My experience with women was no different.  The only reason that I gave it 2 stars is because is smells okay.
2,I wish I could review this but I never got anyone to smell it. This perfume never never lasts with me!!!! Is my unit faulty?
2,"For starters, I haven't even used this product in public to see if the pheromones formula actually makes a difference or not.  I can't see how, given that the smell of this cologne is cheap, overwhelmingly pungent, and about the equivalent of any Axe body spray that you could find.  I used it for one night and I found the smell overwhelming, distracting, and it actually began to mildly agitate me.  I'll spare myself the humiliation of using this cologne in public.  Pheromones or not, the sickly sweet, pungent aroma would be enough to drive women away from you, not to you.  I don't recommend this product at all."
2,"Smells like a cheap cologne and never even received  a subtle look, twitch nor a single positive comment from any female while wearing this oily, supposed pheromone infussed cologne.  The bottle design is very cheap and always leaks from the top onto your clothing leaving oily stains.  I suggest investing in a higher quality, real cologne for better results.  This product probably deserved only one star, but since I was stupid enough to believe the ads as well as ignore the poor reviews, I took pity."
2,Don’t care for the smell
2,"Didn’t like the smell, so returned it."
2,Its ok not that great not worth the35$ I paid for
2,"No positive comments, fragrance is average"
2,I did not like the product personally.The smell is hardly noticeable and also does not long last.
2,Over hyped product that does not smell to well.
2,Was not expecting this to be magical by any means but was very disappointing with the lackluster scent
2,"This product simply did nothing for my senses.... it comes out weird and you are suppose to walk through the mist...however, no matter how much mist there is no one smells anything on me.... just ok"
2,Not sure about it. Seems to give my wife a severe migraine. Purchased as looking for fav Andron scent.
2,"Not impressed, smell lasts for maybe 10 minutes."
2,More women talked to me but i'm not impressed with this product. Would not buy this product again.
2,"First time I bought it, did not care for it."
2,Smells awesome but almost half of it has leaked out under the wrapping
2,Meh na
2,"It could be my body chemistry, no lingering scent"
2,No results it only smells good that is all but no compliments on smell.
2,"Disappointed. It is very ordinary smell, and it doesn’t last long. This was the first and last time I buy this thing."
2,doesn't really have a noticeable smell. disappointed.
2,Nothing special here. Smell does not last. Also I paid for one day shipping on a Thursday and got my order Tuesday
2,I think i got the wrong bottle becauseI dont smell nothing. Its unnoticeable so far. I thought it would smell strong but it doesnt. It stained my shirt. Idk where these 5 star reviews coming from but its way off to me.
2,"It smells alright, but isn't very strong.  I also don't like how oily it is.  The bottle was coated in a film of oil right out of the box, and it leaves an oily residue on your skin.  The lid also doesn't fit very well.  I've almost dropped the glass bottle several times after picking it up by the lid and having the lid slide off."
2,Useless product. I used it for a week and didn't even get acknowledged. I was debating on other one but chose this and regret it.
2,No results
2,"It smells great, but had no effect that I could tell. I've been alone for four years and no one even noticed or mentioned the fragrance."
2,It smells okay... Didn't notice a big difference between this and any other fragrance. The bottle did start to leak a few weeks in and after a month the spray nozzle broke completely.
2,No good
2,I'm allergic to this thing.  If you have issues with acne stay away from this
2,Smells good but is too oily. Enough to damage clothes and feel uncomfortable  on the skin. It's like applying cooking spray.  I was expecting this to be a lot less oily than the oil version. In terms of women paying more attention I did not notice any difference with this and regular cologne.
2,"It has a nice smell...but, nothing really amazing. No one has noticed it, some people think I have no cologne...If you want to get it, go for it, but don't expect anything amazing."
2,Smell is decent and faint. No noticeable attention from opposing sex.
2,"Not sure about the effect on women, but the reason why i  am NOT a fan of this, is because the cologne is VERY oily. So be warned!"
2,I haven't noticed any difference in female attraction. The bottle leaks really bad and the liquid is somewhat thick & greasy.
2,Crap
2,"the product arrived very fast but didn't like its smell(too weak),too oily and not sure about its traction impact,"
2,Seems to smell ok. Haven't used it yet. The bottle was leaking when it arrived before I even opened the seal. Not sure if I'm going to return it yet or not.
2,Nothing yup that's right no effects at all no difference.
2,You get what you pay for. Hot pee.
2,I believe it’s a fake product counterfeit not the real cologne a knockoff. Don’t purchase this item .
2,For the price this isn't a bad buy. But as far as the scent goes I'm not a fan and it does wear off fast.
2,Product not at all as expected. Scent is terrible. Gave it aeay
2,Weak smell
2,no longevity.
2,I bought this for regular use but smell was not happy as it is not lasting long.
2,Nothing special here unfortunately!
2,"I think it's a fake, there is no longevity."
2,Didnt like the scent but tollerated it.. and the longevity of it didnt last beyond 20 min
2,Just not a good smell.
2,Not my first time with  this brand and this one look  like a fake
2,"Not sure if this is a watered down version or if they changed the formula, but this wasn't near as strong as the one I got from Macy's a couple years ago.  Hoping to find it again at the box store and see if they changed them all, or if this is a knock-off."
2,This does smell good but only lasts an hour. I read online that Nautica Voyage was recently reformulated and doesn't last as long as it used to. Too bad. It smells very aquatic and nice but dries down to a gross chemical musky smell so you have to take a shower a few hours after you wear it.
2,Product does not last long like the one from Macy's. I am disappointed at Amazon for having fake products on their site.
2,Though I have always liked and admired Nautica Voyage but this time I believe I got the fake one!
2,Useless. Doesn't worth the money.
2,"The bottle leaked in the back during shipping, empty bottle"
2,Smells old!! ☹️
2,meh
2,I am not to sure what I was sent. Packaging looks legitimate and so does the product. However the smell of the product is nothing like the authentic cologne.  I still have a bit of my authentic spray and my family can smell it from across the room when I spray it even once. However with the product I received I  can't even smell it and I'm the one wearing it.
2,Didn’t like
2,The sprayer was detected so I never got a full spray. It also made it leak so I wasted most of the cologne on the floor.
2,Didn’t like it.
2,It's bad I can't buy it anymore
2,Didn’t smell good to me
2,I was disappointed that it doesn't last long. The scent is very strong and quite irritating.
2,Didn't like the scent. It also doesn't last long
2,Not at all a long lasting one. All stupid reviews over here
2,i don't like
2,The spray nozzle comes off with lid. Not good bottle packaging
2,Not good.
2,Next time I'll buy from the store. It smells good but not like the store brand and only lasts alittle while.
2,"Buyers reviews on Amazon made me buy this product, but reverse is the case.The smell disappeared so quick, it doesn't have fruitiest scent at all. May be something missing somewhere... Not worked for me tho!"
2,Not at all satisfied.the scent doesn't last long even for 30 min. Highly unsatisfied
2,Smell is somewhat decent but not strong. It doesn't last but an hour. I guess since it's cheap you get what you pay for.
2,Definitely not lasting as long as the last bottle I had.  Smells the same but am finding myself using twice as much because of the poor longevity.  Maybe looks a little more blue too?
2,Smells different than the normal voyage. Must be a fake one.
2,Not great... Good price though. A half step up from than an axe body spray overall.
2,This scent is horrible. It smells cheat and very weak. I already gave my bottle away!
2,"I decided to give it a try because of all the reviews I read,but it’s cheap for a reason,you get what you pay for."
2,The fragrance fades away in minutes after use. Certainly not happy with the purchase
2,Spray mechanism does not work. Just releases drops of the liquid. A little disappointing and frustrating being that I want to use it as my everyday cologne.
2,"The fragance is great but the bottle is terribly built. After taking the cap off, the plastic part of the nozzle dettached from the bottle neck. I had to glue it back. Also, the bottle cap does not fit properly any more and is loose. It' the second time I've had problems with the construction of the bottle. Too bad considering it smells very good."
2,"I bought this back at the end of August. It has a great scent and the mossy undertones stick around most of the day. But then after a month or so of use, it just doesn’t smell the same.The scent is hardly there. I wondered if I’d just become custom to it, but I asked other people as well and they thought I’d just stopped wearing it.So if I’d rated in the first month I would’ve given it 4/5...but due to change in performance I am kinda disappointed."
2,not a fan of the scent
2,Not as strong as I thought it would be.
2,I don't like this stuff and I want purchase it again.  The smell is too sharp - nothing subtle about it.
2,Must of gotten the cheap one cause this does not smell good at all . The smell is very harsh and strong. Does not smell pleasant
2,Fake product it didnt last for 10 mins
2,"sucks that I have to give a 2 Star despite the good smell. My shipping was delayed since it was shipped through UPS which I don’t know why since their shipping service is garbage and I had to go pick it up myself, and for two I dropped it on the first day of picking up and it already shattered the 3.4 oz bottle so disappointed."
2,either a lot of you ppl have bad taste scent or its just me but i dont like this smell at all really it just smells like air and crap like i wanted a smell that would keep you wanting to keep smelling it and that actually last long.
2,"Not a big fan of this, picked this up because of Jeremy Fragrance and one of his videos. Ended up with this baby powder type smell, and the scent projection was pretty weak."
2,I don't like the Smell.
2,I personally just do not like the smeell.
2,Fragrance is not good
2,"Synthetic, summer day scent. Not a fan. I gave the bottle away"
2,Changed my review.... Smells great at first but wears off fast.... Disappointed!
2,Frangnance doesnt stay for long and not strong as well
2,"This has been reformulated since my last bottle.  Not bad, but it used to be so much better.  I doubt I'll be repurchasing it."
2,It could be my personal preference but didn't like the smell.
2,"Loved the reviews and the product itself but was not able to ship the item on my desired  address due to courier issues. So I need to abandon the product, since this is not also eligible to return from Amazon :("
2,I think it may truly be fake because the longevity just isn't there.  I essentially need to put my nose on my skin to trace it after an hour or so...Overhyped...
2,"It smells good at first but after a few minutes, it gave an unpleasant scent."
2,Got it for my boyfriend. He said it smelled fake. Will not buy again!
2,"I wear this for a few weeks or so and I'm not impressed at all. The scent smells nice and clean but the power, projection, longevity is horrible. Spray two on my neck, one behind and one on each wrist and an hour or two later, I don't smell it in the air. As it turns out, this is more of a skin frag.  The projection and longevity is really sub-par. Do I really need to spray 4-6 times and reapply every 2 hours? I'm just going to man up and purchase a EROS, AU FRAICHE or Pour Homme. Note: I'm not a perfume junky."
2,"Not so strong of smell, does not last long neither.Maybe for work is this decent smell if you keep puting on during the day."
2,Smell is not good.
2,"Added this to my summer collection. On me, it's silage is weak.  Lasts about 2 hours. Very Diluted. Will not be interested in refilling."
2,Not good
2,I dont like it.
2,Not a very attractive scent in my opinion.
2,"Scent is good, but the top cover broke as soon as opened from package."
2,"Was very disappointed with how long the fragrance lasted. I felt it should have lasted much longer. I think by buying it at this price it is just a older shelf life product being sold. Some store must have had it,returned it, and then you sell it again. Just not happy with the last two times I have purchased it."
2,"It smells very cheap, you get what you pay for"
2,I bought this after looking at all the good reviews  but This smells more of alcohol than a fragrance . I am not sure if i received the duplicate or what !!
2,Smell does not last long too bad because it would have been a good one
2,I'm not sure if I'm a victim of a fake product here but I noticed right away that the scent doesn't last.
2,"Not satisfied, as expected!"
2,"I like the smell of it and the price is cheap, however it is poor quality.  The smell does not last and it is gone in half hour.  I doubt this is e'detoilet...it's more like cologne"
2,"Yeah, no. Got no complements. Felt like I wasted my money."
2,Doesn't smell that great as expected.
2,It does not stay with you all day no different from this or a two dollar bottle from Walmart
2,its okay. Not that good
2,Have been using this perfume since 2 months and I do not like it.  Smell does not long last.
2,Not so great
2,Its a fake. The original scent lingers on for hours; this one fades out in a matter of minutes!
2,not good
2,"For 15 or 16 bucks it looks cool on my shelf I suppose, but as far as cologne this is garbage. I've had 4 other nautica scents over a few years and this stuff is junk. I'm not sure if it is legit or not, but I bought thallium in the same shipment and that blows this out of the water for about the same price. It lasts and you can smell it on your clothes the next day. This watered down stuff lasts 15 minutes."
2,The fragrance is dull and doesn't last.
2,"The scent is OK, but the spray pump on the bottle is hard to press down, and the spray from the pump is very poor!"
2,The product smells like germ-x and doesn't last long at all. A waste of $15.
2,I but it because of the review but I was very disappointed.it was not what I expected I don't like the smell I have to use it once and put it away.not for sorry
2,Did not live up to my expectations. Loved the scent but it failed to last more than a couple hours. It did not have the staying power that I would expect in a product that has so much hype.
2,I didn't like the smell and found it also didn't last long plus I had to use more so I went thru the bottle fast. I will not be buying this again.
2,Kinds stinks and doesn't last
2,Ehh this ain’t as good as they make it seem
2,I am not a fan of the scent and it was not what I ordered originally! I am disappointed.
2,"Absolutely disappointing, not a very good combination of fragrances. If it wasn’t so cheap I would want my money back. I had to change my shirt."
2,It smells very masculine and I woodsy! I do have to complain about the longevity of the scent - it just does not last longer than even 20 minutes. Very weak.
2,Smelled bad and not what I was expecting ... almost like coconut?
2,I get the feeling colognes on these individual sites are watered down.The fragrance lasts about thirty minutes.I'm disappointed!
2,"I was very much looking forward to this and hoping that it would smell at least remotely like the Cremo bourbon scented premium beard oil.  It really does not. In fact, it's rather ""perfumey"", something that could pass for unisex.  It arrived quickly, fully intact. So it's nothing against the seller, it's the fragrance itself but I just found very disappointing."
2,"Pretty generic, starts with synthetic citrus and ends up with boring and overdone aquatic notes. It's not expensive but nothing exciting here. Lasts a couple of hours, it will not offend you but boy it's boring"
2,"Disappointed by this. I didn't have high expectations because it's cheap. But the first spray gives you an ungodly alcohol blast. Yes, I know cheap fragrances will do that. This is probably the worst opening I've ever smelled. Even dollar store perfumes smell better.The dry down is o.k. It smells similar to Spicebomb (Not extreme, but the original). Unfortunately, it becomes a faint skin scent by the time it's tolerable.Uggghh I really wanted to like this (Sorry Cremo)."
2,"Smells amazing, however i got a leaky one wtf.  Still usable if i just never tilt the bottle. It wont let me return it. Lame"
2,Bad smell
2,I was not completely satisfied with the service scent and especially the longetivity Is not worth thevpurchase
2,"This was a gift for my gf for her birthday, I smelled the perfume in the mall and it smelled great! But they were all sold out!  When purchased on amazon and we received it it - it didn't smell like what i smelled at the mall, the scent is faint and underwhelming. Its unfortunate I cant return this item. Not worth the buy."
2,"This is my favorite fragrance, but this shipment came damaged. Apparently it cannot be returned so I’m stuck with a damaged product and no way to get a refund."
2,Not a light sweet smelling perfume at all. Gave it to my daughte.
2,I bought this perfume based on the positive reviews it had and was very disappointed. The flowery scent doesn't mix well with the vanilla scent. The cap broke off as soon as I got it. After smelling it once i gave the whole bottle away to my mom. I felt like it was a scent made for an older generation
2,"The bottle looks good but the perfume is not that great. Once you put it, the smell stays only for few minutes and then you are done. Doesn't feel like you are wearing any scent. Was very disappointed. I got it looking at the reviews but it was as good as not wearing any perfume. Not worth the money AT ALL!"
2,Fake not the real thing scent doesn’t last
2,Do not like this scent! Smells cheap
2,The top of the bottle is gold instead of the silver one I had previously and it smells more alcoholy than actual perfume. Smells fake as hell. I don’t like it
2,before i buy any products i always look its review..i did the same thing before buying this perfume.i find very much positive review and immediately order it.but trust me it was waste of money.i am not sure this is orginal or not but the smells fade away very soon.i am so disappointed with this perfume.giving it 1 star.
2,"Smells like old lady perfume. Its legit horrible. My 24 year old gf didnt like it one bit, we gifted it to her mother and she loved it. (Atleast thats what she said) also from what i gathered this is a fake and not an authentic perfume. But regardless this stuff sucks."
2,"Did not smell very good at all compared to buying it in  store, did not last."
2,Probably a nice fragrance for some but too heavy and powdery smelling for me.  I'll be returning it.
2,You get what you pay for—it is cheap and it smells cheap.
2,Didn't like the sent.
2,"Bought this last year and only used it roughly 10 times as I have long thick hair that I typically let air dry. Loved the product and results. However, after roughly 10 uses the heat stopped working. Without this function it is pointless for me to use. Very disappointed."
2,"I am very upset with this product, it is already burning out on me!!!"
2,It dries and styles great. Easy to use. A little noisy. But disappointed it broke down after a couple of months
2,I love the final product after using this dryer but I have to give it a bad rating because I have now gone through two dryers in the last 12 months. They both started making a terrible noise as if there were pieces of metal flying around inside the handle.
2,Started smelling like burning and its not drying good. Not happy.
2,"I've been wanting to try a dryer brush. Very disappointed. Metal part gets extremely hot and if you have thick hair it takes many, many, many passes to dry hair, and yep the very HOT metal part burns your hair. It was suggested that i partially blowdry/air dry my hair then use this to finish. No thanks, I wanted to limit my heat time and take steps off of my routine. Made my hair frizzy, and the frizz was permanent after a few uses because of the damage it caused. Save your money, save your hair!"
2,the previous reviews i read are what made me finally give in and make this purchase. it’s not very easy to use (although i can’t round brush my hair either) and so heavy i can barely finish my hair. the noise is absolutely ridiculous when turned on high. it only takes about 12 minutes for my to blow dry and straighten my hair. using this tool alone took more time and didn’t leave my hair nearly as smooth. i would not buy again or recommend to a friend.
2,"4 months and it stopped working. Second time for me, don’t buy this brand again 😞"
2,"(My hair is medium/thick, silky, and wavy for reference). I bought this product to get more volume, but if anything it just weighs my hair down. Absolutely useless as far as drying my hair. At first I thought maybe I was just using it wrong, but I’m not—I’ve spent hours watching tutorials and mastering their techniques. I think it just doesn’t work for my hair type. :(  Seems to work great for other people’s hair, but in my experience, it was a waste of money."
2,Delivery was fast and careful. The product is ungainly and not round. I must’ve misread the description as it is more texts than I expected.  The temperature control is not at all easy to use while drying and styling.
2,"I only used this product once because I got terrified at the burning smell it caused when I turned it on.  It did a great job of blowing my hair out and it's easy to use, but when I came back on here and saw all the reviews about the burning smell, I decided to return it and buy a more expensive one from a different brand to prevent my hair from getting damaged."
2,I love the idea but was too heavy for my handsI have arthritis and was to difficult to use
2,I followed the directions of waiting for my hair to be mostly dry and no matter how well I have brushed my hair this always pulls my hair and gets tangled!!!! Maybe I have too much hair.. I’ve tried sectioning my hair too but it just gets tangled and pulls my poor hair :( my mom and sister in law love this product. So maybe it’s just me..
2,Very disappointed with the sound had to return.
2,"There was no temperature control, sometimes it was the right amount of heat other times it got so hot I could barely stand it.  Not even a year old and it already burned out."
2,"Purchased January 2020, August 2021 it caught on fire. The handle always got hot while using and it had started to smell more “burnt” over time, but one most dryers tend to get that smell after a while and two I had no idea it was going to catch fire. The bristles also slowly heated sideways in some areas… possibly too hot to begin with."
2,"After 7 months this product started having a really bad burning smell and the bristles started to fall out. Actually caused the smoke alarm to sound when using. It worked great for the first few months. I’m calling the company, should not pay $45 for a product that doesn’t last."
2,"Got this on prime day because I kept reading about it everywhere.  It’s a fine dryer but I don’t see any advantages.  Doesn’t make my hair straighter, smoother, or have more volume.  After a while (and you need a while bc it doesn’t work very well) it gets really hot.  It’s also heavy.  I used it about 6-7 times and got rid of it.  For reference my normal dryer is a Dyson."
2,"Very large item, so makes it hard on shorter hair."
2,"Last week, the device started to make a noise like the motor was dying. Then today, it became a noise scary and loud enough to send my toddler screaming and sobbing into the other room (he was observing my make-up/grooming). I realize hair dryers' lives come to an end, but that end should not be after 28 uses. I bought this for myself for Christmas 2020 (Mom life purchasing my own gifts), and started using it in Jan. 2021. It's end came today, August 6, 2021. This is unacceptable and disappointing."
2,"It’s not worth it, you won’t use it.It takes 9 million years to dry your hair.This will be clutter in your bathroom."
2,"I really don’t know what is all the hype about. You cannot use the higher setting because it is too hot. it is crazy! even the low temperature is hotter than my liking. If your hair is curly or even wavy, forget about it! It took me less time to blow dry my hair with a normal one+ flat iron it than using this hair dryer! also it is a little heavy. I used to have older brush hair dryers and prefer them. I returned this one!"
2,Loved this at first but I got it in May and it already is broken and doesn’t heat up when blow drying. :(
2,Very disappointed that the bristles fell out after a few months...
2,Broke off my hair.
2,"It’s powerful but when you put it on high, it gives off a high pitch sound that if I have it on for more than a few minutes it really starts to bother my ears.  Maybe my ears are sensitive but I usually have it on low for this reason and it just takes a little bit longer for my hair to dry."
2,It was good while it lasted. I used it twice and it didnt work on my third attempt. It doesnt turn on. Didnt return cause i got rid of the box. This purchase was a total failure.
2,It’s too heavy which makes it difficult to style the top and back of hair.
2,I thought this would work for short hair. It doesn’t. Only good for long hair.
2,"Supper disappointed with this junky appliance. Too big of a brush,  the unit itself is  bulky  with cheap bristles means a no - go from me."
2,I’m not feeling really safe with the noise and the smell that the product is doing when it’s on…It looks like it’s not good quality and might caught on fire so it’s scary. I’ve using it for only four times and the small peaks of the brush are king of melting! So over all for the price I’m not really happy with this product !
2,Gets way too hot- damages hair and is too large which makes it hard to handle
2,"This WAS the pefect tool for me, had me hair done in just  a matter of minutes!  Barely had for 6 months and it totally quit  working! VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
2,I got this product less than 6 months ago it was working fine for the first couple uses but then it literally stopped working no matter what I did the blower dying is great but it sucks that it just stopped working I think it’s a poor design flaw or I got a bad one so beware if I knew it would stop working so soon I would got a different brand. If you’re going to get this just find a different brand
2,My hairdresser has 4 other clients with completely broken hair and the only crossover is we all use this blowdryer.  I like the way it works but had to throw it away.
2,"it only lasted three months, bristles broke and started to burn after three months ,only used it once a week."
2,It produces a lot of noise and it seems something is broken inside it!!The quality is very lowe in comparison with its price!
2,Bought this 6 months ago and it already stopped working. Will not heat up.
2,"The short brush bristles on the head of the dryer are already damaged from the heat of the dryer.  It is obvious to me that the high heat setting is too much for the bristles.  I am disappointed in the quality, would not buy it again."
2,"I loved it the first time i used it, incredible results but i noticed that the hot air wasnt coming out after that first  use. I tried resetting, cleaning the filter, and making sure jo hair was stuck anywhere but it was hopeless."
2,"I did love this item but it stopped working.  I purchased it last October.  I only used it once a week,very disappointed."
2,Broke after 7 months. No lingers blows air out and it’s no longer hot! There’s no hair in it at all! Disappointing.
2,This item was sent to me used! There was hair in it! Gross!!!!!! The box was beat up really bad too.
2,"Worked well while it worked, died after 7 months, used a couple times per week."
2,"After a month of use (after the return window closed), my revlon brush broke! It only blows cold air (no longer hot). This is extremely disappointing. I have been looking forward to this for so long."
2,"I’ve had it for a year and 5 months, and it broke.  A small plastic piece that locked the brush onto the dryer wand broke.  Since I can’t return it, will try duck tape ( of course)!"
2,I loved the idea of this but I had a tough time using it. It found it really heavy and awkward and hurt my arm and shoulder to use it. Been sitting in the drawer after using it a few times.
2,Might as well just light your hair on fire and burn it off that way
2,Item stopped working after 3 months.
2,"After just a few uses, the motor stops working.I went through 3 of these in a few months!"
2,I really enjoyed this hair tool. After about 30 uses it stopped blowing out hot air... no longer can use it. Disappointed in the quality of this product.
2,It's hard for me to handle.
2,I loved it while it was working but it stopped heating up after 2 months of use (3ish uses per week). Don’t know of a warranty so waste of $45.
2,Died after 4 months
2,I liked it a lot but stopped working after a few months.
2,"This thing was a game changer, when it worked. Bought it April 29th. I only used it about 10 times and now it is dead! Doesn't turn on. So incredibly disappointed."
2,It didn’t get hot enough for my hair and it was so heavy my arm got  tired  using it.
2,"Occasionally I smell a “burnt rubber” smell scared to even use it on my head anymore. Not happy with purchase. Relatively easy to use, I think I might try another brand or style."
2,Not a fan
2,I think mine is defective because there’s no air power it barely blows out air but that what I get for taking so long to use it
2,I purchased 3 of these fur myself and my daughters. 2of them work perfect but the 3rd one cuts on and off continuously as I'm drying and styling my hair. Very disappointed in the lack of quality in this item.
2,Bought it in January; now since May it’s been giving problems.
2,"Although it drys your hair very fast and straightens it, it destroys your ends. It makes my hair frizzy and even with heat protectant it still kills my hair. Straightening my hair regularly is better."
2,If you have normal size women's hands using this tool is difficult. The brush size is way too big to manipulate - - - bad design. This makes the rest of the features worthless if you can't control the brush
2,I noticed a lot of breaking on the ends of my hair after using it a few times . wish I could just return it because it is too damaging to my hair
2,I tried this because a friend of mine got one and was raving about it. I hate it. Wayyyyy too much breakage. Nope nope nope. Back to the blow dryer I go!
2,"not so great on curly hair, it doesn't get the roots, the concept was good but it just doesn't give the heat coverage that I need with concentration on my root"
2,"I have bought this dryer THREE times now because I love it so much, but it has now died on me after about 6 months THREE TIMES. I am so upset because I love the way it makes my hair look, but I cannot buy it again since clearly the product is faulty."
2,"very disappointing, heavy, difficult to handle."
2,I loved the product but it broke and stopped working after the first use..
2,Handle too large & it’s very noisy
2,Not effective for straightening
2,"Used ONE TIME ONLY & the bristles warped & deformed with the heat! For reference my hair is very thin, long & curly 3b/c & was 50% dry before I used it. I don't know how this product received such great reviews. Didn't work any wonders for me & the unit is already damaged. Very disappointing. Would not recommend."
2,Made an awful noise after a few months and starting burning on the inside. Do not recommend.
2,"Stopped working in a year and I don’t even blow dry my hair like that. At the most I probably got 10 uses of this brush. Extremely disappointing and now I’m stuck with a useless hair tool. My hair texture is fine so I don’t even know how this brush lost its power and when turned on, it sounds like it’s dying. Very little air comes out. I think the motor burned out."
2,heavy and big. I believe it takes practice using - which i have not done. It's heavy and difficult to maneuver for me.
2,"I was so excited to finally get this dryer. I’ve seen it everywhere and had it in my cart for a while for some reason and finally ordered. It’s very easy to use, but I would not recommend it at all because of the heat. There are only 3 settings: high, low, cold. The low barely blows hard enough to dry and the high completely fries your hair almost because it’s so hot. I’ve only used it twice because I’m afraid it’s damaging my hair. I pulled a couple pieces of my hair out of the brush that were completely burnt black at the root."
2,"At first it was working fine But when I traveled to another area, I turned it on, and smoke and the smell of fire came out of it, and after that it no longer works, I only used it 5 times"
2,It did a great job for the 5 times I got to use it over the last 5 months. But today plugged it in and it immediately burnt out and stopped working. Very disappointing.
2,"I got this brush in Dec 2019 and LOVED it for the first 20-30 times I used it. Sadly this past weekend it stopped working and just blows cool air out now, the heating coils must have broken. Not sure why as it was just sitting in a drawer and suddenly stopped working one day."
2,"I thought I was going to love it... but I didn't. First, it's huge. More flat than round, and at most it brushed and dried my hair. It was way too hot, and I still had to style my hair after. Waste of time. To be fair, I did try it multiple times. Just not happening."
2,It’s VERY heavy and makes it hard to maneuver on short or thin hair
2,I ordered this product 6 months ago and already it has stopped working...it shuts off even on the low settings.  I'm really bummed because I like the fact that it's a dryer and brush combination.  I probably won't buy again.
2,It’s too big not good for scanty hair
2,Wasn't wow'ed by this product. I have really thick hair and all it did was frizz me up :/ Will continue letting my hair air dry and returning this.
2,"Quick, smooth blow dry. My onlyIssue is the high pitched noise it makes.UPDATE: I finally had to replace this with a different brand. My husband said to be prepared to join a class action lawsuit for hearing loss and to at least wear ear plugs if I continue to use it!"
2,I bought this apple cider shampoo and the conditioner that came with the set because I am having hair falling out and itchy scalp. It did not help either problem. I will probably give it away to the homeless donation.
2,This review is purely for the conditioner in this set. I love the acv shampoo. The conditioner is horrible. After a few uses the build up on my scalp is awful.. even if I only use a small amount. My hair feels disgusting. Do not recommend.
2,I had to stop using it cause it dried my scalp out too much. I heard rave reviews about it for those who deal with dandruff/dry scalp but after the 3rd use I just itched really bad and stopped use. I wish it would’ve worked.
2,"I like that my hair is thicker, but my scalp is unbelievably itchy and when I scratch it it leaves this black residue under my nails!  So needless to say I won't be using it any longer..."
2,Used the entire bottle before I wrote the review but even after five weeks of using this shampooer and conditioner my hair is worse now than it ever has been.
2,I hade seen reviews where people were pulling out more hair due to this shampoo and conditioner and I should have listened to them. Gobs of hair came out. Hasn’t happened again since I stopped using this
2,Not at all what I expected. Does not smell that great and dried my hair out.
2,"Used it and my hair felt awful, tangled up easy and just not a fan of it"
2,Hair did not feel clean.
2,Claims were that it will remove residual buildup left behind by hard water. After having used both shampoo and conditioner my hair still feels matted with residual left behind by hard water.
2,"I was not pleased, it made my hair feel Dry no softness at all compare to other shampoos and conditioners"
2,"Store bought high end brands work better on my hair than these. Not a great smell, but maybe I am used to added perfumes to everything I buy. I have very dry, color treated hair and the conditioner did not work with my hair type."
2,I like the shampoo but the conditioner is not good my hair is ratty & feels coated after I use it..
2,My hair has been falling a lot more than usual and it doesn’t help with dandruff either. Very disappointed!
2,The scent was great. The moisturizing wasn't great. I count come my hair when I got out of the shower. It was not soft at all. I lost a lot of hair.
2,Was not impressed with the shampoo or conditioner they did nothing special to my hair I didn’t notice any softer or any difference to texture
2,Used for 3 months not worth the hype
2,"I was recommended to try this product by a youtuber who does reviewers over hair products for women with dry curly hair, and has dandruff. Later I read the reviews and the product seemed promising so I purchased it. After trying this product four to five times I realized that I was loosing waaaay too much hair in the shower. Keep in mind the I apply hair oil to my roots before washing my hair and brush all my knots out before heading into the shower so there shouldn't be that much hair that comes loose. Overall, this product is not for me, but everyone's hair is different so purchase it at your own risk."
2,"I have chronic scalp dermatitis, and this product despite its description and claims, did not help if anything irritated the condition more and had a burning sensation when using.  I would not recommend using this product."
2,"I was very disappointed, I had purchased this before and loved it so when I saw it on Amazon, and cheaper than what I had paid before, of course I wanted it. Will not buy it again. My hair did not feel clean afterward and there was no bounce to my hair, it laid flat as if it was not clean."
2,Terrible left my hair brittle and dry
2,Weighed down my hair and didn’t feel clean.  Would not recommend.
2,"Used for 2 weeks, hair dryness was worse."
2,"Maybe it is my age,but this did not do anything positive for my hair (I am 74). It lathered well, but when I put conditioner on I could tell I was in for problems. Oh,followed directions. Could not put a wide tooth comb thru my hair without a struggle. Lots of hair came out in my comb,I was not happy about this at all. That's was when I decided to rebix and return this item. Very disappointed! Reviews sounded great. Oh well!"
2,"For me, this product did not do anything significant to my hair. It did not help with the dryness or frizziness and did not make my hair shiny or healthier."
2,Left my hair very knotty! Nothing like I expected.
2,I wanted to try this shampoo as a replacement for the brand I usually buy here on amazon since this was a cheaper alternative. And I absolutely hate it. I tried to keep using it for the past month to give it a fair shot but it makes my hair shed like crazy & it doesn’t do my hair any favors when it comes to moisture or scalp cleansing. I have mild dandruff & my usual brand (purador) clears that right up but this made it 100 times worse out of nowhere. I’m also not a fan of the bottle. Has no pump. doesn’t lather very well. & overall I’m disappointed
2,Not impressed!
2,I didn't particularly care for this product...not the fault of the supplier...I may just have weird hair. The shampoo kind of dried out my hair and my hair was not quite as manageable as usual. I tried these products because of the recommendation of my hair stylist  who thinks highly of them.
2,I read a lot of reviews before buying it. My hair is very oily and I had high expectations for this shampoo to help me. It turns out it made my hair even greasier and also gave me dandruff! I insisted but no success. Just didn't work for me.
2,It made my hair dry and itchy. I did not like this product. Bumps starting popping up in my head.
2,"I have used this combo as directed for 2 months now and have seen no difference in my hair. The products are fine, and I will finish using them but there is nothing special about the results."
2,I really am not a fan it has a powder scent which I don't like my hair is soft once it's dry but is a nightmare to brush my hair is shiny but still falls out ALOT and is itchier than it was before 👎👎
2,"Wasn’t impressed, didn’t end up keeping"
2,Not impressed . Left hair oily. Did not help with frizz at all.
2,This was a good smelling product but it made my hair feel very sticky and tangled. It also made my hair very fluffy and just all around feel bad. I was not very satisfied with this product.
2,Not like
2,Unfortunately my daughter and I both tried the shampoo and conditioner but it dried out our hair and left it rather unmanageable.
2,"I’m not one to complain, but this product did nothing for my hair. I have very thick hair and saw the reviews were amazing on here so I purchased it.  Some people said to wait a week and a half to see results, so I did but nothing happened. My hair felt worst and on top of that very greasy. I don’t know if this product just works for women who have thin dry hair. For women who have thick hair I do not recommend this product."
2,Makes my hair frizzy and dry.. I'm not impressed at all
2,"I have never used,a shampoo that left my hair,feeling line straw!  I do dye my hair,and it said if was safe to use but this was the worst experience ever.  I tried,a second time and there,was no difference.  I sent both shampoo and conditioner back.  It dud not work for Mr a d I say buyer beware!"
2,My hair had never been as freezing as it is I have to stop using it the conditioner is horrible what a waste of time money very unhappy
2,"After reading the reviews I was hopeful that this “healthy + moisturizing” set is exactly what my hair needed. Unfortunately, after using for a month (washed hair 1-2x weekly) it aggravated my scalp. Now I’m back to using my T-Gel shampoo to calm the dandruff and itchy + irritated scalp back down.Sad this product didn’t work for me."
2,"I’m not sure if they have a new formula because I used to looooooove this set but now I just don’t feel my hair clean, it feels greasy and dirty even the same day I wash it"
2,Product didn't do anything for my hair. My issue is worse now.  Won't buy again.  False advertising
2,"As I said it of, but it did leave my hair a bit dry.  Didn't see the gloss with the conditioner"
2,Unfortunately I was not impressed.  My hair looked dull.  I did not get the shine and softness that was advertised - disappointed!
2,It didn't do anything for me. It didn't help a bit with dandruff and my hair and scalp is still extremely dry. I've used it many times. Doesn't work for me and too expensive.
2,"I gave this 2 stars because I liked the squeeze spouts that come with it. The conditioner is awful. Feels gross on my hair. I’m going back to ordering the Magestic Pure of the same type of Apple/Coconut shampoo-conditioner, but I’m going to keep the squeeze spouts instead of using the pumps and put it on my other bottles."
2,seriously not even worth it. Waste of money.
2,Wasn’t as expected. Dried the heck out of my hair even though I followed directions. My hair dresser said it’s more of a detox since it strips your hair of the oils. Wouldn’t recommend if you have tangles
2,Really dried my hair out. My hair stylist said the acid lightened my hair and made it dry out. It made it feel fake soft.
2,I used this for a couple weeks and my hair was like straw. I even left the conditioner in longer than necessary but it still didn't help.
2,Says it helps with product build up..... my hair looked so much worse than before using this shampoo conditioner set! I gave it a month of use to see if it was just changing the ph balance of my hair or something else. But it created SO much disgusting build up! My hair looked dirty RIGHT after washing. And my hair was heavy and limp with zero volume. I had high hopes and was severely disappointed. The only good thing is it smells nice
2,Did not help with itchy scalp at all
2,"I used the shampoo and conditioner once and felt sticky and there seems to be a residue. The conditioner smells terrible. After washing, it didn’t make my hair softer and smoother, but I always felt my hair was dry and itchy scalp."
2,"Leaves my hair so dry I can’t even brush it out without adding extra conditioner after I’m out of the shower. Then I’m pulling my hair out when I brush, and blow dry, which defeats the purpose of this product"
2,Take my advice (or don't)...skip the combo and just buy the shampoo! My hair felt like straw after using the conditioner. I had to rewash. It really is THAT bad.
2,Received two shampoo and no conditioner
2,heavy and oily - disappointed
2,"This product is made for people who have seriously oily scalp & hair. Or for people who use ALOT of products on their hair, like clay based hair dyes. It strips hair fast if anything on it, good or bad. For me, my hair is normal-to-dry and no product use. It dried out my hair badly. The smell is very strong, unpleasant."
2,"I wanted to love this product.  The smell is amazing but it leaves a horrible residue on your hair and scalp. It is so bad that when you run your hands through your hair, your hands will have the same residue.  I have used this product for a little over a month, hoping that my hair would start transitioning to the product. No such luck."
2,"I purchased this product mainly because it has ACV in it and it's supposed to get rid of scalp buildup. I've been using it for aboit 3 months and haven't noticed a difference, sadly. It's also supposed to reduce the amount of hair loss. I don't see a difference in that regard either. Doesnt make my hair grow any faster like they claim either. I do not plan on purchasing again as it is NOT worth the cost at all."
2,Don’t care for it
2,"From reading the reviews, I was hoping that the shampoo and conditioner would be extra moisturizing to my 4A hair, but I was not impressed.  Aussie Miracle Moist Conditioner works better for me and is a lot cheaper."
2,Was disappointed in this product(s).
2,Hair felt dry and frizzy. I never felt like I could rinse all of the products out
2,"I thought being in pool all summer was drying my hair out, so sounded like it would be good product but w length of my hair it just made it dried out. It smelled good but didn't help my hair at all.I read a review that was bad and should of heeded the warning"
2,The shampoo is not good to my hair is getting softer.
2,"At first I was really excited about the product due to it being gluten free, the scent and how it felt after the first time or two that I used it. After the first time or two using it my hair has felt like it's covered in wax and it's matted up and disgusting. I don't want to throw it out since it was $30 and it's past return window so I'm not sure what to do. Was really disappointed due to high ratings and what I actually experienced using it."
2,"I struggle with dandruff and thought this would be a great product to try. Unfortunately it didn't work for me. My hair started to fall out badly. My hairdresser was shocked how bad my hair was falling out a recommended O stop usage. Once I did, my hair bounced back.FYI, I have medium hair on the side of thin and struggle with scalp issues."
2,This shampoo not 100% helpful reduced lost hair
2,Not easy to spread
2,Very hard to use it with the bigger bottle
2,No improvement using this product. Actually I’ve noticed that the hair would even fall more.
2,This was recommended to me by a naturopath. It’s a sticky mess and does nothing for me. A total waste of money.
2,15 months pp and still dealing with hair loss I was in search of a product to help. I wanted to give this a try. I tried leaving it in my hair for 30 mins twice a week. It was no a pleasant time. It’s so sticky and wet. You can’t forget and touch your head or lean on anything. I gave this about 5 weeks before giving up.Update to now. 19 months pp and taking vitamins and hair is coming back without this product. I think some people just take time. So hang in there
2,"It is very sticky oily texture. Hard to apply.tried to have it overnight and wrap with towel, my head feel really moist and sticky during sleep. Even try it with one hour before shower, it goes over my face and drip. Haven't see effectiveness."
2,"Returned. It smelt weird definitely not like the kind I’ve gotten before. Plus it is so so thick. I shook it up and tried to funnel it out into mascara tubes. I’ve done it with other brands, this one wouldn’t go through a funnel or sucker. A syringe would work but I didn’t want to go through the effort"
2,"Haven’t had a chance to use it ...the plastic container that it came in the neck of the bottle was cracked off and almost ‘decapitated’. The oil had leaked out into the mailing package, VERY messy."
2,I don't like scent
2,"Bad scent, also this product was expensive compared to other products"
2,"This is NOT for sensitive skin. Burned my eyelids, cause pimples all over my brows and made my dandruff 50x worse."
2,Not sure if it’s doing the right thing but my hair is very thick but every time I use this Oil it becomes very soft and thin as if am loosing my texture.
2,"My daughter Used this same product from a small bottle but when my daughter used it on her eyelashes this time, texture was different—heavier and it irritated her eyes for a day or two. Now I have a very large bottle that won’t be used."
2,I bought this one for my wife for her hair fall problem but it doesn’t worked that great.
2,Not so great hard to spread
2,For some reason I could not get this product to seal and most of it is lost to my carpet when it falls. Barely got to use it. And I believe this made my son break out.
2,Terrible customer service. Never responded after three  inquiries.
2,This stuff is awful! It’s like trying to spread syrup on your hair. I honestly haven’t seen any benefits from it probably because it was so hard to distribute through my hair. And yes I diluted with coconut oil. Still awful
2,Only used once and let set an hr on scalp then washed out with shampoo and conditioner. Next day I had horrible stomach cramps and diahrea. Im not seeing anyone else complain about this tho! Anyone?? Would have liked to have seen if it worked for hair growth but im honestly scared to get those cramps again!
2,"I used to buy organic castor oil from the other brand which was really good. Since I wanted to try this one which is also organic and less pricey than the other one, I decided to go with it. However, the organic tag looks fake and there's no non GMO tag. I asked about this before buying but the answer wasn't helpful. This is my one time purchase, would not buy again and I would not recommend this to anyone."
2,"So thick it’s useless. It literally pulls my hair as I try to spread it, it’s like glue"
2,Only giving 2 stars because I received the package damaged. I have no idea if product works. Bottle was open and was all inside the package it was delivered in. Now I just want to throw whole thing in trash because whole bottle is just a mess right now.
2,"Product gave me pimples in areas I never new to have, I think the product was too strong on my scalp it was irritating my scalp.  It was uncomfortable. The product is very thick. I used it on my daughters and it hasn't caused the same thing it has helped them on growing longer hair, on mine no much however I did notice my hair was not falling as much."
2,Its a good thing i bought 2 castor oil products. Cuz i wasnt sure which one is a better one. I bought it for ingestion purposes so i wanted to make sure its 100% organic pure. This one has a real chemical taste verses the other one had a castor oil taste but no chemical taste. Besides for the fact that despite the plastic wrap the oil had leeked out of the bottle cuz it was not properly sealed. Im not sure about its authenticity.
2,"I'm a 40YO Caucasian female who has had a long standing issue with shedding and hair loss. I regularly go through ""shed cycles"" where I lose a ton of hair. Well I purchased this oil about four months ago and have been using it at least 1-2 times a week. I rub it in at night then wash it out in the morning. About a month ago, I entered into a shed cycle and was losing tons of hair. I finally decided to stop using caster oil last week and the shedding stopped almost overnight. I am hesitant to put the entire blame on the caster oil as I have regular shed cycles and I did have quite a bit of stress a few months ago that could have triggered a shed cycle. But the fact that the shedding stopped right after I stopped using this caster oil makes me highly suspicious it caused the hair loss. I'm not going to risk it anymore,"
2,Haven’t noticed anything in a few weeks. It definitely leaves your hair very oily (obviously). But I unfortunately haven’t noticed any growth in my “bald” patches.
2,I returned this because of the weird smell...
2,A very sticky product. I used it a few times and then disregard 90% of the product.
2,I don’t know if it works yet. It probably does. When it was delivered it had exploded in the package! Gross!!!!
2,I don't notice any growth of hair.
2,too oily to skin. I expected to help my itchy skin but failed. Maybe good to skin for hair but really oily and unabsorbable for skin
2,not sure why others reviewers have results but not me
2,"Ive tried a couple different brands of organic castor oil and I was so confused when I saw how thick this one was. It is so thick and sticky making it really hard to work with, it sticks to my hair and I feel like I am just pulling my hair when Im trying to massage the oil into it. I tried warming it up a little but I really cant seem to make this work. Will not re-purchase."
2,2 stars because there is nothing wrong with this product the only thing that is wrong is the dissinformation that it advertises and people perpetuate that it will help hair grow. After diligent uses for over a month as instructed on the packaging there is no change. Researching this also yeilds that there is no scientific evidence to support its assertation that it helps hair growth but even worse: there isn’t even enough scientific basis to even warrant research. Just an old-wives-tail folks!
2,"I bought this in January, for my natural Afro hair, it makes my hair fall outing large chunks and sheds my hair. I don't use blow dryer,  I air dry. Each time I comb,  I cry at amount of hair I loose 😭😭😭"
2,"My main purpose of purchasing this product was using as a laxative.  I checked its description and purchased.  After I opened and tried for my skin, I found that ""this product should not be taken as a laxative since the bottle does not have drug facts with FDA mandated directions and warnings. It is not healthy for some people to take laxatives, and the company should not be promoting this as a laxative on this website. "" Now they deleted ""laxative"" use from its description."
2,"Since I bought it and hate returning things, I think it’ll just be used for my body. I used it for my hair once and I started seeing more shedding than before. It scared the crap out of me so I will no longer be using it for my hair. Read the bottom of the labels, discontinue if excessive hair loss, I’m tying to grow my hair not lose the little bit I have."
2,I have lost most of my eyebrows and lashes due to thyroid disease. After a month and a half of nightly use there has been NO improvement. It was also somewhat irritating to my eyes. Disappointed!!!
2,makes a mess and no results for my use
2,The liner is amazing but I used it maybe 5 times in a span of two months and it dried out and is unusable :/
2,"I usually really like NYX products but this didn’t meet my expectations. It went on smoothly but when doing the wing, the pigment was really poor so I had to go over it with my Stila liner. Then to top it all off, it wasn’t returnable. Won’t buy NYX on Amazon anymore."
2,Ive used this eyeliner already for a weekIts not smudge proof at allI kept wiping off and by the end of the day it looks like I was crying my eyeliner offI had high expectations :(
2,"I used this product a few times at home before I left for vacation and it worked well. Fast forward to vacation (we traveled by car, it was kept in correct temperature the whole time) it exploded into a black puddle of doom. I guess I can say it has stay power because ot took days for the stain to leave my cuticles. Not a big fan."
2,"Yeah so I'm a nyx power user and my go-to is the nyx matte liner but decided to try this stuff out because of all the hype. Unfortunately, I was sadly disappointed in this. Lies - this liner WILL budge, smear AND transfer so I don't know what they're talking about. I have hooded eyes and it doesn't matter if I wear primer, eyeshadow, setting powder; the liner transfers on top every single time! At first I thought it must be user error but I promise you, I have tried everything and this liner is just NOT what it claims to be.  I like the applicator and you can get a sharp wing, but I'm going to stick with my matte liner. I only wish they made that formula in a pen style applicator like this one. Don't waste your $ just buy the matte liner, not this one."
2,Not waterproof. Came off quickly when eyes watered . Color is light and watery . Overall bad
2,"I bought this liner as it's ""waterproof"" (or water resistant - forget which,) and because of all the glowing reviews. I have been wearing liquid liner since my teens and definitely found this one lacking.First off, it lines with a very thin coat, which means multiple applications = having to buy a replacement more often. Secondly, it smeared much faster than my go-to Almay. Lastly, I had no trouble washing this product off with water.Did I just get a bad item?At any rate, lesson learned and I will be sticking with my liquid Almay."
2,I take a long time to put this on because i suck at it but it dried up really fast and stopped working half way through my makeup
2,"Not waterproof, doesn’t go on easily"
2,"My issue with this product is that through normal use, the bristles on the brush have started to come apart and stick out, so it is not longer a single point. The stray hairs sticking out cause additional lines, so I can't really use it without making it a mess. Defeats whole purpose of product."
2,"I have been using this product for awhile because it’s cheap and does the bare minimum of the job. Now I’m sick of it. The tube is constantly leaking. At first I thought it was just a fluke or defective first one, but EVERY tube I have gotten has ended up leaking. It bleeds everywhere. Take your money elsewhere, or just end up disappointed."
2,Looks nice for about an hour.  I had people all day asking if I was sick because it had smudged so much under my eyes that it looked like I hadn't slept in a week.  Not a good look.
2,"As I was applying this to my upper lash line, apparently it released a big drop off liner that ran straight into my eye."
2,The only reason I am giving this such a poor review is because of advertising.  I ordered the 2 pack and only got one item.
2,"it only came with one eyeliner when I ordered two. it's also not very good quality either. kind of sucked to be honest, I wouldn't buy it."
2,"Very inky and thin, takes a long time to dry. It doesn't give a bold line either, it's very thin in consistency, not very pigmented, and it doesn't work very well to keep going over the same spot to darken it."
2,I love the eyeliner but am very torn. I’ve had a few of them and had issues with the dispenser every time. Usually at some point they get leaky and will leak all over. Sometimes they will self correct later. I’m not sure if it’s a pressure issue. I almost stopped buying it because it’s such a pain and waste. I just haven’t found another liquid liner that I like as much.
2,Typical eyeliner. Nothing special. Easy to apply but no different than any others I have used.
2,"I have oily lids. Comes right off if I touch it, smudges too. Very disappointed"
2,"The pen leaks, the tip isn't great, it's not really waterproof in the slightest (one drop of water and a smudge will take it right off with minimal effort), and it bleeds like hell on shimmer shadow. Overall I wouldn't buy it again and would probably opt for a pricier brand next time if it means my liner won't bleed all over my shadow and ruin it like this one does"
2,"I've bought this eyeliner many times and I always have the same problem with it. After a few weeks of use (at most) it starts to explode. The brush tip gets over-saturated and eyeliner starts to bubble at the end of the plastic tube. If you notice it, it's easy to wipe off the excess (though it will come back), but if you don't, you end up with an eye full of liquid eyeliner. Of course, this also makes it run out at a faster rate.Bottom line, a decent cheaper alternative to say, Kat Von D tattoo liner, but it *will* explode, no matter how you store it. And you *will* at some point end up with an eye socket full of irritating eyeliner."
2,I was really disappointed with this one because the reviews were so amazing. I’m not sure if I got a defective product or what but when I got mine the eyeliner was not staying on the tip of the pen whatsoever. There were beads of eyeliner dripping from the pen making it impossible to draw any sort of sharp winged eyeliner.
2,It ran and came off in the inner corners of my eyes. I only used it in the top lid and my lid was prepped with urban decay eyeshadow primer and matte eyeshadow.
2,"I had such high hopes for this eyeliner, based on the reviews!  I’m very disappointed, however, because I ended up with smeary and smudged black eyeliner all underneath my lower lashes even though I’ve only applied this liner on the top lash line.  What a mess! 😡 It’s embarrassing to realize you’ve been walking around with black smudges under your eyes, like some kind of baseball outfielder.  I can’t imagine what a mess I’d have under my eyes if I’d actually been sweating or crying or something.  I would absolutely NOT recommend this liner to anyone after the experience I’ve had.  The only reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because the liner is intensely black, easy to apply, and you can draw a nice sharp line....just don’t expect it to stay put for long.  Going back to the tried-and-true Stila Stay All Day eyeliner, which is expensive, but it really does stay all day (and we’ll into the night)."
2,"I am perpetually on the hunt for smudge-proof, tear-proof, and waterproof eyeliner. The only eyeliner that has been able to do this is MAC LiquidLast. I had high hopes for this, but unfortunately it needs to be re-applied during the day along with my concealer, which now has some smearing from the eyeliner. Any crying removes all of the eyeliner....maybe I have special tears???"
2,"I don't know if I'm doing something wrong but this is almost impossible to open, I've resorted to using pliers"
2,It’s VERY thin and watery. Bleeds everywhere and over all makes a mess.
2,"used to be my fav eyeliner pen for the price. Last one I bought leaked a ton of eyeliner into my eye ball while using it! It made a huge mess. It did this more than once. I've bought this product in the past without issue. Not sure why this one was defective. I'm switch to a higher end brand, sorry."
2,"I usually use NYX products, though some of them could have better quality. This is one of the Nyx products with bad quality control this brand has a lot of problems unfortunately and at least its easier to order from Amazon than directly from them."
2,"This eyeliner holds up over-time however about 1/4 the way through using it I started noticing immediately when I'm applying it, it's bleeding all over my eye. My eyes aren't watering, nothing has changed, but all of a sudden it's bleeding everywhere. Once it sets up it stays so sure it's ""waterproof"" but not when you first apply it. I have to throw this item away now and get something different. VERY disappointed..."
2,"I love the formula and the tip but its entirely unusable due to how the ink comes out of the tube.  Bubble form around the base of the felt but no ink reached the tip. Ive tried shaking it, leaving it upside down, and dipping it in makeup remover but nothing works snd jusy leaves me with a blotchy eyeline if the ink even reaches at all."
2,Would not recommend. The brush is very delicate and seems to thick. Used it a few times and got ruined.
2,It only applies smoothly the first time I used it. After that it was hard to put on and took a few coats to look decent.
2,"When I purchased this back in February 2020 it was around $3. Now it’s doubled. I would have given this 5 stars but I’ve only had this for about 2 months and the top busted and leaked everywhere! Now way to fix the thing, and it’s impossible that I broke the item.  It’s a great pen, I don’t feel it’s justified a 5 star rating when it busts within 2 months."
2,The hairs on the liner spread out and ruined my eyeliner use
2,Too much started leaking out and I was difficult to draw thin wing.
2,"I wanted to like this liquid eyeliner.  I wear liquid eyeliner on a daily basis.  This one just didn't work for me.  It bled on my skin when I applied it, not giving me a sharp line/wing.  Also, this specific one leaked.  Hopefully it was an isolated incident but overall, I will not be purchasing this eyeliner again.  It was too messy.  Once it dries, it is water resistant."
2,"This stays all day through normal wear but is by no means waterproof. If you are prone to oily eyelids at all, it will also smudge.Would have returned if I had remembered in time."
2,Leaks a lot and the bristles come off easily...blurs and bleeds every time you apply. Not a good product at all.
2,"Looks like it's a dupe. Doesn't stay on, isn't smudgefree or waterproof.I do like the precision tip. But what's the use if it's just going to get messed up in minutes."
2,I bought this as an option to replace my stila eyeliner. This eyeliner is harder to apply because the tip is made up of individual hairs and not felt sponge like stila. It isn’t as forgiving because of this and when you put the cap back on it bends some of the hairs back. Sure it saved me money but I’ll splurge for stila next time.
2,I got this for waterproof but not really waterproof. And it takes time to dry.... not really satisfied.
2,Terrible eye liner. It’s so liquidy it runs after you put it on! So frustrating. I end up with big splotchy lines that make it look like I’m 5 years old trying to use my moms makeup. I’ve tried wiping the tip to dry it out a little and nothing helps. Don’t waste your money.
2,My friend swears by it but it doesn't last as long as I expected and smudges badly on my skin
2,"After reading that this was a much cheaper dupe for Stila Stay All Day eyeliner, I decided to try it out when it was discounted to a price too good to pass up. The liner tip is excellent and it went on beautifully, but after a few hours, the smearing was awful even when set. For those who have issues with eyeliner staying in place, this will likely not work well."
2,"I bought this as I love the brand , Sadly it ran right off after applying :("
2,Dont buy this if you're wrinkle prone. Itll leak into your wrinkles and just.. ugh.I'm sure I'll find another use for it though.
2,It was awful. Didn’t last long enough to smudge.
2,Had high expectations but unfortunately not waterproof at all
2,Really tough to use compared to others I've used in the past. Could be user error...
2,From the time I put this eyeliner on it began to run and smudge. I wouldn't recommend.
2,"Not too good ,,it leaks out alot of the liquid, as your putting it on ,its terrible ,sorry"
2,"Bleeds like crazy, takes forever to dry, any thought of eyes watering makes it smudge and smear. Would not recommend."
2,Not happy with the eyeliner. It’s not waterproof
2,"Within a couple of hours I have raccoon eyes. It smudge to my brow and then somehow ends up underneath my bottom lashes. I’ve tried it with and without other makeup, oil less makeup, primers,etc. I need to go back to my Stila eyeliner. :("
2,About two to three hours after using this eyeliner you will see black layers under your eyes. I am disappointed. Going back to my stilla.
2,"This product is absolutely NOT waterproof!  I can wipe it off easily with a wet finger.  However, it is very black and does apply evenly.  DISAPPOINTED!!!"
2,"Actually, I've purchased these previously and never had a problem. This time, I received a problematic eyeliner. The spring mechanism was way too hard to open on this item. Seemed it suctioned down too tightly, more so than any of the previous eyeliners of the same kind/brand that I bought from this vendor. Upon removing the lid in order to use this eyeliner, the eyeliner would ooze out black liner liquid and drip down the pen and onto the vanity and sink. After beginning 4 mornings of trying to get ready for work after cleaning up the black dripping liquid and also having to begin my eye makeup all over again, I threw this eyeliner in the trash. I sadly got a very defective one this time that hemmoraged everytime you opened it."
2,Broke (eyeliner bust through and exploded inside the cap) just a few weeks after daily use. Going back to Kat von D tatoo liner.
2,"It's not waterproof at all. After 5 minutes of applying the eyeliner, I accidentally touched one of the wings and it completely erased, after two hours of using both wings and parte of the line disappeared. It didn't leave a smudge thou, it just disappeared. After four hours it was like I never applied any eyeliner."
2,Applies nice but doesn't stay on. Smudges into my eyelid and it's kinda sticky. Not impressed...
2,The eyeliner bleeds and runs in tiny lines in any skin wrinkles you have. I am unable to use this at all due to that huge problem.
2,It doesn’t stay on at all! Had mine on for 2 hours and it was ruined!
2,"Ordered the black nyx liquid liner. Color was a nice deep black but my issue was the liner once applied didn’t dry very fast, it would drip from lower lash line and if you blink it will get all over your lid and mess your eyeshadow up."
2,100% not waterproof or smudge proof. I ended up looking like a raccoon just 20 minutes after application. Very disappointed and embarrassed walking around looking like a hot mess.
2,"Fine product but there is a leak and it made a mess on my other makeup, and I keep wiping the neck and using it because I hate to waste it but the quality of this dispenser is poor.  Normally love NYX but at the same time, ordered the thick eyeliner pen and the soft tip part of the marker fell off after 2 months of light and infrequent use.  I can’t recommend these pens to anyone even if the liquid itself is nice for its intended purpose esp. when paired with Urban Decay eye primer."
2,"it bleeds a lot and have to wipe it with a napkin before applying it, even then it bleeds sometimes. Also the brush gets constantly  caught in the cap and makes it all fuzzy. Do not recommend"
2,"I’ve worn many eyeliners in my life, and this one seems to be the best one ever! I have tried out Kay Von D’s and it was so smudging and would erase easily. This one lasts for hours and I couldn’t be more pleased :)Update 2019: how did it go from a 5 star to a 2 star?!While I really loved the eyeliner for many years I couldn’t help but hey annoyed that the tip would dry out so fast and the cap was so hard to take off. Because of that, the ink would fly out ruining my clothes, desk, and even makeup. I have used it for years, but I don’t know if they have changed the caps. Formula is the same, no smudge, but the product is in a inconsistent tube that drys it and ruins everything in sight when opening it."
2,Bought this brush twice and leaked both times. Made a mess in my purse and on my clothes. Don't recomend mainly because of the bad mechanics.
2,"After reading many positive reviews, I was excited to try this eyeliner... it arrived timely, so shipping was no issue and once the eyeliner is on, it works as described. But the issue I am having is that it leaks all over the place. I’ve tried storing it upright to see if that might help, but nope. It’s been a dripping mess every time I use it. Very disappointed."
2,Sometimes I open it up and it is extra watery and ruins the face makeup I don't have time to redo. It also tends to run under my eyes by end of day.
2,"Worked great for a bit. The quality of the liner is good, but the bristles on the brush are splitting and the liner bubbles out of the tip. I thought something was wrong with mine until I stumbled on a thread asking if anyone else had experienced this and several other people confirmed theirs did it too."
2,"Well... it was good until it suddenly started leaking. Not sure what happened since I’ve only used this a couple of times. I’m not a fan of the top since it’s more of a brush than a pen, but it was useable. Now it’s just leaking and watery. What a waste."
2,"This is terrible. Not a good substitute for the Stila. Yeah, it’s way cheaper, but not worth the savings. Doesn’t make a sharp point, so wings look dull and stupid. Smears immediately. Rubs off a ton on the top of the eyelid. Can’t wear for more than an hour, 2 tops. Just buy the Stila!"
2,Black color is solid. The tip is like a little brush and not a felt tip. A little difficult to get a precise line if you don’t know how to maneuver. Also a lot of product comes out of the pen and bleeds into the eye which burns! Wasn’t designed the best.
2,"This was recommended to me by a friend who said it wouldn’t move throughout the day, maybe there was an inconsistency in the formula that I got, but found that my wings would start disintegrating midday. Disappointing. :/"
2,I was very disappointed how hard it is to put on my makeup brush!
2,Got it due to the zillions of reviews. Don’t like it because it feels greasy and heavy compared to my higher end stuff. But the biggest complaint is the fragrance. It is a heavy coconut smell that stays.
2,Irritating my skin. Like the color and I’ve used this product in the past and it didn’t before. They must of changed something
2,Smells funky
2,Have ordered multiple times and it has been broken every time. This formula is too soft to be shipped well.
2,Product fell apart. Color wrong too light. Dies not have depth.
2,Disappointed that most the products were made on china when the full sizes are not. It It is making me question if they are really from PF
2,I brought this product because I saw it had great reviews. Sadly my bronzer was all broken into pieces when I opened it
2,"The clear plastic top was broken; exposing the bronzer, which will no doubt be ruined without something to protect it. Basically there’s nothing to cover the bronzer."
2,Make sure you know what you’re buying I normally get the regular bronze but because I have light skin FitzPatrick scale 2 ( freckles light skin)I thought I would try the lighter one welllll  don’t do it I don’t care if you have porcelain skin don’t do it especially this time of year because you can build it up and it still will not get to the level that you need .  Everybody should just buy the regular bronze and less you’re  FitzPatrick scale  4 and up.
2,I love the product but the makeup was completely broken and all over the place when I tried to take it out of the packaging.
2,I was expecting something different.  It’s like a sample pack but the colors were all wrong for my skin. The bronzer was way to dark
2,"It only gets 2 stars for very fast shipping. I was excited to try this with so much hype surrounding it. First, it was way too light and I have pale skin. The coconutny scent was overpowering and nauseating. Then, almost immediately after applying it, it itches so bad, I had to wash it off. I'm still itching. They did refund my money to my account immediately though."
2,The product was completely broken.... how idk because it was in a box in bubble wrap. I legit dropped my brand new highlighter on a tile floor and it didn’t shatter so idk what they were doing with this whole it was being shipped! I obviously cannot give this to my daughter for Easter now!
2,"Item was used, had already torn packaging and swatched item before I looked at the brush that had makeup on it already. And color was too light 🙄"
2,"Overall I did not like this product and I returned it. It smelled like a fake sun tan and grossed me out. It also wasn’t a pretty color in my opinion and was actually too dark, and I’m medium skin toned."
2,"Product is quite dark,  and didn't work well on my pale skin.Applies very heavy."
2,Love this product but the case was totally broken when it arrived. Thankfully the powder was still in tack. But the top part of the case was broke.
2,"Not sure why this color is labeled as  ""deep"".  My complexion is tan (Mac NC45) for reference, and it does not show up on me."
2,"broke my skin out. it’s drug store quality, i know but if u have sensitive skin or prone to clogging, i don’t recommend. within a month of using (and i only use makeup 2-3 times a week), my face was completely congested and breaking out. the color is not even that pigmented ...."
2,"Just received this product today, and unfortunately it is shattered! I have ordered other items and it has gotten all over the other products as well."
2,"Came broken, scent is overbearing."
2,Broken up after 1 used.
2,Orange looking & hard to blend
2,"I like this product but I will probably purchase in store next time.  Since it's a creamy powder, it's fragile and was cracked up when it arrived.  I can use it but a lot was wasted and spills out whenever it's used.  This compact cannot be carried without putting it into a ziplock bag.  VERY MESSY."
2,it came broken
2,"It is velvety soft and easy to blend. BUT, no one told me it smelled like a drunken stumble into Ex Calibur casino. Yikes, it smells so bad. Will use it because i’m cheap, but won’t buy again."
2,The product arrived with the container shattered and product broken - EVERYWHERE. Such a mess & so disappointed.
2,Came broken/shattered. I noticed it came with a puff or something? I coudnt get to it unless I wanted to spill all the broken peices and powder. I used a brush to get all the loose powder (which was alot) and tested it out. I noticed no pigment.
2,Nice formula and color but it smells like a horrible mixture of crayons and glade.
2,"it came broke because the package was not really safe, so I can not give a good advice just can say smell good, so sad"
2,I received this shattered in the box.
2,"Too hard to work with, feels like you have too much or too little. The scent is nice but gets old quick. Not a winner, prefer M**lani baked"
2,I love this product but mine came completely shattered ...
2,"When I received this product, it arrived in a box with plenty of protection but the compact powder bronzer turned into a very loose powder bronzer. It had found it's way out of the compact it was sent in and covered everything including the plastic bubbles.  I couldn't move anything without getting this powder all over me and the carpet. I threw away the shipping box and its contents out of necessity. I had no product to return so I wasn't eligible for a refund. I  ordered the same bronzer in a different color. Ended up being an expensive bronzer."
2,"CAME BROKEN!!!! but other than that, does the job. couldn't get all of the product because half was broken!"
2,"The coconut smell is chemically and strong, the packaging of the product (the compact) is giant because they include a useless foam paddle in the bottom that goes straight in the garbage. Yeah the product isn’t bad, but the price isn’t exactly drugstore and the packaging makes using it feel cheap. I’ll use it up but I’ll never rebuy."
2,This product arrived totally shattered and unusable.
2,Arrived cracked and broken.
2,"Love this product, however it was broken when I received it, very disappointed!!!"
2,Didn't drop it... but it broke after a week.
2,My daughter's favorite product. Ordered two- arrived today both completely shattered. Very disappointed teenager here.
2,Looove the product but came completely destroyed from shipping both times I received it. Eventually I went to Ulta and picked it up in store and it's my favorite summer bronzer.
2,Good product but came shattered and the package was coated in product
2,The product came and it's exactly what I ordered however the latch part that keeps the case closed is broken and won't stay shut. It's kind of a bummer and makes it hard to keep in my makeup bag because it won't stay closed.
2,"The packaging came broken: crack glass on the top. Also, the applicator that was supposed to come with it was missing. The smell, which was allegedly coconut, is barely detectable, as it was open to the air due to the broken cover. I’m very disappointed. If you are going to ship a compact, it should be in bubble wrap. Terrible service. And I ordered the bronzer colour, not light. It doesn’t even show up on my skin."
2,I received it quickly but unfortunately the content was cracked and broke into small pieces
2,This did not cover or conceal. Not impressed
2,"I initially loved how much coverage it provided!! But after 3-4 times of using it, I noticed nothing was coming out. The applicator stopped working. No matter how much I twist or push on the sponge part, no concealer comes out. So disappointing. I wanted to love this.."
2,"Cheap, stays on about 5 minutes, poor coverage."
2,generally you can't see the pores on my face. I got this product for some darkness under my eyes only. Every method of application leaves me looking like my skin is an orange covered in bad foundation. Terrible. Would not recommend this product at all.
2,"Maybe I expected too much of this concealer but I wasn't impressed. It took me like 10 minutes to figure out how to get the concealer to come out. The brush doesn't help at all, so I don't see the point. And didn't show as much coverage as I thought"
2,this was thin and didnt cover very well. very watery. hardly any coverage at all.
2,It is so hard to cancel order. I didn't know I hit the reorder purchases. It is so hard to cancel.
2,"Very chalky, doesn’t come out well"
2,It settled right into creases and lines. Awful.
2,Too drying and hard to get out and have to use a lot.
2,Not impressed.
2,Dries to fast and wrong color.
2,Not sure what is wrong with it. I’ve been twisting for days and nothing is coming out. Love this concealer but ordering from Amazon was a mistake.
2,Extremely difficult to prime
2,"This item was a waste, the product in this item lasted only a week and it was empty. I will not buy again and don not recommend it. Very deceiving. Because it is hard to tell how much product is in this tube, I did not think it would be empty in less than 2 weeks. I only use it once per day, I should have more than a weeks worth of product in the tube. It is very deceiving to buy a product that only last a couple of days. I will not buy again, It was very disheartening to know a company would sell a product knowing it it half full. If I was given free product i may consider buying again."
2,"This is my second purchase of this item, as i thought the first time it was my bad luck and i got an empty bottle, this time is the same issue , whatever hard i press nothing is coming out only very little traces which does’t make any difference, i will not make a third purchase to be sure , i got an idea two times already !! And excessive pressing on around eye sensitive skin is not good and cause damage and wrinkles."
2,Sponge broke off in a week
2,This is really a difficult product to use. It came with no instructions on how to get the product to release.  I think I'll cut off the the spongy part and try cutting it open with a set of pliers.
2,I watched the video and I turn it like it shows but no concealer is coming up.  Very disappointed as I was so looking forward to using this.
2,So hard to open and use. It would up in the garbage.
2,Very little coverage  Very disappointed
2,A little too sheer. Not great coverage. I don’t like the sponge.
2,I used the concealer for less than 2 weeks when it stopped dispensing to the applicator. I tried storing it upside down for several hours but it didn't help. This was the perfect concealer for me but I hesitate buying another.Any suggestions for fixing this problem?
2,"I was looking forward to using this under my eyes to hide the dark circles under my eyes.  Initially I was pleased,  but before I finished applying my makeup,  the concealer disappeared.  Perhaps if I had set it immediately with powder, I would have had different results."
2,It just doesn't act well as a cover up
2,The pump doesn't work well at all.  You have to push it down really hard for anything to come out. And its dry on my skin
2,I have no idea how good it works or looks because when I read the label and saw some very very harsh chemicals in there no way would I put in on my face.
2,Difficult to use and too creamy
2,Misleading shade
2,Not a fan of this concealer. I don’t like the quality and the color was too light for me which is my doing . I don’t like the way you have to click it to get more product out. Can’t tell if it’s coming out until you feel it.
2,Doesn't cover very well. Not sure what the hype is about.
2,To difficult to spread
2,It’s hard to use . It also dried my skin out under my eyes .
2,The colour is off for my skin tone but going darker or lighter will not work. Plus it really doesn't cover my circles. It may if I wore foundation but I don't. So you can see this makeup on my face. Very thin and I'm not fond of the spongey thing on the tip.
2,"When I received this I was not sure how to get the product to advance, I twisted until it clicked, I'm still having issues with it advancing to the applicator"
2,No coverage and very dry product.
2,Rather greasy looking on face and poor coverage. Didn’t work for me.
2,"The make up itself is good, the applicator is what is terrible.."
2,It cakes under my eyes and doesn't spread well.
2,Im not sure if im using it wrong but it seems to make things worse not better.
2,"So, I used this concealer a few years ago and I wasn’t a fan. But since then people have been raving about this concealer, saying it’s the best “drugstore” one you can get. I decided to try it again, because my skin has changed and I thought perhaps they changed the formula. NOPE! It has very little coverage, and it’s not buildable. The consistency is slimey and feels super weird. When you blend it out with any tool it looses even more coverage. I also bought a darker color to use as a “cream” bronzer, I found that it oxidized terribly. The coverage that this does offer, doesn’t last long and settles into lines terribly. The applicator is also annoying because sometimes it doesn’t work! Also, it is super unsanitary, having a sponge tip just collects bacteria. Really not a good idea for acne prone skin!"
2,Hard to open
2,Cannot get the product to come out onto the sponge!! I've tried everything. Just got frustrated and don't even try anymore.
2,"I was really disappointed. I’ve purchased maybelline products before, but I wasn’t happy with this. Be careful of your color selection. I bought medium and it has an orange hue to it."
2,This concealer really doesn't conceal: too transparent. The packaging and design was awful. I could figure out how to get the plastic off and how it worked. It doesn't cover well and it dries and looks worse than the dark circles under my eyes. Expensive and not worth it.
2,It would not come out good! Would not order it again!!!
2,makes my skin look old (im not old) would not recommend. i would rather show off my undereye circles than wear this concealer...
2,Didn't like at all
2,"Does not seem like enough cream is getting onto the applicator to apply to skin. It has been twisted a ton and you can see the applicator turning the color of the cream, but nothing is going onto the skin when applying."
2,I bought this thinking it would help with my dark circles but it only made my dry skin look worse.  I tried applying lotion first and there was no change.
2,VERY light coverage. I would have returned this if I hadn't waited so long to open it. Total waste of money.
2,"Not sure if I received an old one or not; have used this in the past many times, but this was extra thick, wouldn’t spread and just cakey; a MESS"
2,Very messy
2,It is very hard to get any liquid out of this tube.
2,I like the makeup but I’m giving it 2 stars because of the container and how much is wasted in the bottle that you just have to throw away as there is no way to open the container to use the rest of the makeup. Fix the container and I’d rate it much higher!
2,Not ny favorite . I do like the container but its too drying for my eye area. Not my favorite product
2,Way too thick and heavy.  Waste of money for me.
2,"I really only use concealer for the occasional blemish, and this product definitely won’t do the trick. It basically disappears as you apply it. I found it to be watery compared to higher end products, and I was not a fan of the applicator."
2,"Does not disguise dark circles. It, merely, serves as an ineffective layer of lighter color, which makes it worse. Putting too little does little. Yet, putting any amount, even a bit more, than a tiny, makes your undereye area appear as one with black circles, yet, painted over. Very disappointing!"
2,It’s very hard to get the product to come out of the sponge opening. I got no use out of this and it was complete waste of money.
2,Didn’t care for this product. It doesn’t cover much and seems a bit thin.
2,I think I would like this if I could get it out of the dispenser. I have twisted and twisted. There is color on the sponge tip applicator but not enough to actually apply. I have probably twisted it a hundred times in an effort to dispense it. I would not recommend unless you have a degree in engineering.
2,"Very little concealer came out on the sponge tip so basically useless and frustrating.  Will not buy this type of product again (where you cannot control the amount coming out).  Also, I don't think it is hygienic for the sponge applicator to be attached to the concealer IMHO."
2,Be aware make sure you read every detail in description because they make it look a lot bigger than it is obviously I know by the weight if I was to really look at but it can be deceiving this is a very small
2,Doesn’t spread as easily as hoping. Nothing special.
2,I really wanted to like this but it was difficult for me to use and a waste of money. The applicator is not easy
2,Poor coverage and what little coverage it provides it is short lasting.
2,The foundation works well the applicator is awful! It gets dried out and cakey and soaks up all the concealer before you can apply it.
2,I like the formula however the tip ruin it for me barely comes out
2,It didn't cover my circles and it settled into the fine lines around my eyes. Disappointing.
2,Couldn’t get it to work. Very hard to use
2,"It settles into pores.  Not good for mature skin, unfortunately."
2,They're sharp but too bulky in my opinion for dermaplaning. There were areas that were hard to reach because of their width. Will order a different brand next.
2,"I saw these razors on a Buzzfeed Shopping Article and I thought man this sounds amazing for my peach fuzz. At first, I thought I was holding the blade wrong or just going in the wrong direction. But no matter how I held it or which way I went it still hurt and made my skin feel rough afterward."
2,"Was a rough shave for me, and I broke out after"
2,I'm giving this 2 stars because it is quite a razor but it was way too sharp and cut my browbone on both sides and gave me razor burn.
2,It's a lot more painful to use than other items.
2,Probably not what you want
2,I did not particularly like this product but I kept it being I opened it and used two of them.
2,They don’t work very well and really scrape up my skin without removing much hair. Not a fan.
2,"Be very careful if you are using this for dermaplaning! I had been using another brand that worked very well, but I thought it might be time to get a new one. This one looked the same as the one I had been using. I used it the same way I had been using the other one,  and not for an excessive time. There are no instructions on how to use it.I got a horrible, raised rash that has lasted for days and itches badly. It looks and feels awful. I have to use make up to cover it up. I'm afraid it might even leave scars.Very unhappy."
2,"These just didn’t work very well. Its like they were just rubbing my face, not razoring. All three in the package were a dud."
2,Horrible on the skin. I decided to try this new brand on my face and its by far the worst. so easy to cut yourself even when attempting at the correct angle. will not be buying this product again and i do not recommend.
2,Gave me really bad ingrown hairs above my lip and on my chin
2,Very dangerous to use on the face. A lot of people say it’s easy but using a blade on my face isn’t safe at all.
2,I’m honestly not sure how these have a good review. They are terrible. Not sharp. Don’t cut clean. I’ve used it twice and both times it’s left scratches and little cuts on my face and I don’t have sensitive skin at all. Doesn’t get a close shave either. They are so cheap because they aren’t good quality. I have no idea why these other reviews are praising them. Please don’t buy.
2,To big and awkward to hold
2,I'll pay the extra and stick with Flawless blades. These seemed courser and sharp on the edge. Put a small cut in my cheek.
2,"Cut and scratched my face no matter how i did it and the blades are too long, can’t reach small crevices."
2,Gave me a HORRIBLE SKIN RASH. I don't know if I misused or what but OMG. never again
2,"I saw these on the internet as a way to get rid of unwanted peach fuzz, everyone was raving about how soft their skin felt but forgot to mention how prickly your face feels as the peach fuzz grows back. It’s really no different than if you were to use a leg razor on your face in my opinion."
2,"I usually use facial razors from Sephora, but I decided to give these a try. I'm pretty disappointed tbh. These somehow were less effective and more damaging to my skin. After one gentle use, my skin is sore and I noticed three small cuts on  my face. Will be tossing and going back to Sephora brand. Sadly I already opened the package so I cannot return."
2,Bought for touch ups on eyebrows/between eyebrows and facial hair.  Very irritating to my sensitive skin.  Almost cut off too much around under eyebrow.  Not easy to use and not good for sensitive skin.  Ending up throwing away after 3 tries.
2,"I have super sensitive skin and this irritated it so much. I ended up with red streaks and cuts all over. It removes the hair well, but not worth it for me"
2,These are not what I expected at all. Decent. But not as great as described
2,I can't believe anyone would like using these. I dont think its gentle on the skin and if you're left handed its awkward to use.
2,"These cut my face, don’t buy them"
2,Very sharp not sure why the review asked if this was moisturizing when it’s basically a metal serrated scalpel I must not have done this right because I ended up with crescent moon cuts in my face
2,"They need an edge guard, totally cut my face with the end holding it as directed with the tip."
2,"Stupid product.  might as well just shave your face. When the hair grows back, it comes back as stubble."
2,Don’t like this and do not want it shipped to me every three months! How do I cancel this????
2,I got really bad razor bumps all over my skin that lasted for a week! Not using this ever againnnn
2,Didn’t like these.  The blades are dull so it feels more like scraping than blading
2,Dull.
2,"Applied very modest pressure, didn't bear down on it at all.  The handle just broke off right beside the blade head.  Very weak design.  Maybe just one bad one?  I'll try another and if it repeats, will try to get refund and buy a better model"
2,Cut my skin not my eyebrow hair
2,They seem very dull compared to other brands I’ve tried!
2,This do not work good.  Be careful when using them.
2,Cut my skin multiple times when using product correctly. The length of the razor makes it harder to maneuver
2,as soon as I tried this product I started bleeding on my lip and. Chin maybe I didn’t do it correctly but it hurt bad
2,These are just terrible. I used them on my eyebrows (no threading/social distancing) and they do not remove the hair smoothly and the blade is just dull...NO
2,I wouldn’t buy this again. I had to use a lot of pressure to see any skin removed and it gets dull after 1-2 uses. I didn’t notice anything different after using. I would suggest spending a little more for a better quality set.
2,"Fortunately this product is gentle, but it isn't particularly effective for dermaplaning. It scratched my skin up terribly. I had sandpaper skin for weeks.  Definitely don't use if you have sensitive skin."
2,Maybe it’s my fault for expecting more but I thought this would be similar to dermaplaning . But it’s just a regular razor .
2,Cuts you!! It removes the hair but left my face bleeding and with scratches.
2,Reason for 2 stars is...... I’ll just stick to waxing . Hair grows back darker on face and faster too! I purchased this because I got tired of waxing my face - and what a mistake . I would use this in the future only to clean up my eyebrows but that’s it!
2,Each one had a piece of plastic that cut my skin
2,"The handle is fine, but the blade is just awful quality.  There is an edge on the one that I have used thus far that is not good.  It is defective.  Don't know about the others."
2,Broke me out :( will be sticking to tinkle
2,These do not work well.
2,"These cut my face to shreds...they definitely  take the hair and dead skin off, but the design is flawed in that the tio somehow cuts the face .I had decent sized cuts all over.  Won't purchase again.  Recommend the tinkle razor..much better luck with that one."
2,"Honestly, I don’t know what the hype is. After using the product it left my skin very very irritated, burning, and red. So I applied a hydrating sheet mask after and my skin was still super red and on fire after. Maybe I didn’t do it right, or maybe I have more sensitive skin that I thought. But I wouldn’t recommend"
2,Irritates my skin.
2,"So big, mine broke in a couple days and I only used it twice on my boyfriends eyebrows."
2,I thought these would be great considering the brand. It didn't even do anything (or much). I had to run over the same area at least 3 times for it to be semi-effective. Very disappointed. Would not recommend.
2,"I use shavers all the time and this is my first time using this brand. They cut me up!! I have little cuts all over my eyebrows?! And the width of the razor is crazy wide so unless you have a lot of real estate under the brow, I’d avoid these."
2,I love the concept of these. I use them to edge my beard and eyebrows.The big flaw for me is the blades are serrated.Why they would use serrated blades that will scratch the skin and yank at the hair baffles me.This leaves to very painful usage.I’ve  tried using with water or shaving cream but no help.I wish they would start using non serrated blades. I may have to look for other options.
2,This didn't work as advertised. I'm not sure if I did it wrong or something. But it didn't seem to remove any of my hair. Or stray eyebrow hair.
2,Not impressed with these..prefer the other brand people use on amazon. These did not leave a clean finish
2,"Why not use a regular twin blade disposable razor? I bought this product thinking I would have more control trimming under my eyebrows. Maybe I’m holding it at the wrong angle, but using it seems kind of rough and doesn’t accomplish what I’m trying to do. Uncomfortable and scratchy on the skin."
2,Didn’t care for these!
2,These are way too big to use on your brows! The razor is so long that I have accidentally cut my eyelashes slightly while trying to shave my brows. I can't really use them except for other facial shaving like upper lip.
2,Gets dull after two uses. Does scratch a lot of you don’t use the right angle. But the dullness is why it deserves a 1 star. Only use on face and gets dull super quick
2,This gave me extremely painful razor burns all over my face.
2,Don't really like this product and be careful cuz you will get cut
2,"Not what I expected. I got these blades to exfoliate my face, not really for peach fuzz. They did not seem to get any of the dead skin. And the one spot I wanted it to remove the fuzz it did not. It was harder to use than expected."
2,Awkward to use.
2,It did not work very well
2,This first one I tried to pull out of the package broke and they did a terrible job removing hair and it felt like it was just scratching my face.Not getting them again.
2,Kinda useless. Doesn't do much.
2,I was not impressed at all. This only irritated my skin and was difficult to use. It doesn’t work like the ads show.
2,i thought this touch up tool would be take off my facial hair but instead it gave me a rash on my face!! I have sensitive skin but I guess it was too much for me.
2,I can’t agree with the good reviews. This “blade” was so rough on my skin I had to stop using it.
2,This didn't work well for me. I still had a lot of peach fuzz. I couldn't get close enough to my eyebrows for fear I would take off way too much.
2,"Not satisfied at all. I bought it for doing my brows. Waxing and threading makes me breakout terribly, plus I want my eyebrows to grow thicker eventually, so this seemed like the right choice. False. The blade is too large and awkward for the eye area. I accidentally took some of the tail of my eyebrow off today with one slight slip. Not worth it, sis! Maybe I’m just trash at using these but it never gets close enough to not leave stubble, and it robbed me of some eyebrow. I’m upset. Lol!"
2,Disappointing.  Doesn’t work well at all.
2,Does not seem to take the fuzz off like I thought it would.  Disappointed!!
2,They made my skin very dry from the scraping.  Each one only lasted through 5 or so uses.  Would not recommend.
2,It doesn’t work unless you go over it multiple times which is really irritating to the skin
2,"Was excited to get rid of peach fuzz & dermaplaning. But they were so dull they were useless. Maybe got a dud but got money back. Good luck other purchasers.  Update..Seller refunded my money & didn't have to return the blades. Gave them an additional star for excellent customer service 👍. After reading the good reviews maybe I just got a bad set, too bad."
2,They don’t work super well. They haven’t effectively cut hair from my skin.
2,These were awful for me. Left red scratches on my skin and did not always take the hair. Terrible for sensitive skin.
2,I felt their instructions were too brief with this product and I am not sure I was even using it correctly. I didn't want to experiment much because they are very sharp! After trying one a few times with mixed results I threw it away. I still have the unused ones but I am not sure I will try again.
2,"While the blades do carry out the job as described in description, I was surprised when after using I looked in the mirror only to find tiny, bloody gashes were all over my face! The blade actually dug in further than I thought it would. The 2nd time I tried ‘exfoliating’ my nose pores ( per the instructional guide), and the gash that was left on my nose bled for most of the night. Won’t be buying again."
2,"Had to go over face repeatedly, though not recommended, didn't remove hair.  Ended up using tweezers again."
2,I don’t think I used these right but I cut my face with these :(
2,"I normally use Tinkle razors to dry shave my face and legs. I tried these for a change. They’re more expensive and dulled much faster, giving me a bad shave and major razor burn. I’ll stick with Tinkle."
2,Just a razor nothing special and my face hair grew back rougher feeling
2,"these weren't great. my hair isn't especially coarse, but these dulled/rusted quickly"
2,Didn’t like these as much as the Tinkle brand.
2,Not comparable at all to professional dermaplanning. These a just crappy razzors that shave your face without cutting you.
2,They cleaned up all my peach fuss but it scratched and cut my face
2,I disliked that it did not remove hair. It felt like I was scraping my skin and appeared that way because of no hair removal.  I'll keep trying and seek advice on ways to get results.  😟
2,"I didn't like it , its harsh on the slin"
2,I had read these could help with the little baby hairs on the face so i got them...they’re nothing exciting. They actually pulled at the hair and it was painful and the. I had razor burn. I won’t be buying them again. It’s easier to use a regular razor if I’m going to go that route vs waxing. Disappointing.
2,This is just a straight razor in a fancy handle.  There are no instructions on or in the package.  I can't seem to make this work .... at least not safely.  I'm going back to plucking eyebrows and a multi blade razor with a flexible head for my chin.
2,I really really wanted to like these as they are a brand name so I had high expectations but unfortunately they weren’t as sharp enough for me as the tinkle brand razors and they did not last a very long time at all. My tin kle razors last me months at a time
2,They scratch and cut my skin not happy would not buy them again do not waste your money
2,Waste of money. Blades are dull and have to keep reshaving in order to work
2,"I suggest you do your research before attempting to use a razor like this on your face. I tried it 2 times before realizing this was making my face worse than before. The first time I used this, I thought it went well until I saw a bump on the top of my lips, it started off as a pimple and eventually grew into a cyst. It took 4 months for the cyst to go away and I'm now left with a dark spot above my lips. I technically didn't realize that the razor caused the bumps until I tried it a second time and my face ended up with small bumps under my skin all over my face. I eventually had to go to an aesthetician for help. I'm now left with worse hyperpigmentation on my skin which I'm going try to get rid off with an acid peel. the aesthetician basically told me that the razor wasn't sharp enough in some parts which resulted in the hairs being cut but not completely, and as the hairs grew back it caused an inflammation. The cyst was obviously caused by an unnoticed cut  . If you're prone to ingrown hairs, I would suggest you find something else."
2,"These are just razors. What a waste of money. If you use them, your hair will start growing back in a couple days because it's just a fancy razor really. I totally misunderstood the product. Maybe I'm the only one, but I'm just saying... watch out. There is nothing revolutionary going on here as far as shaping your eyebrows. We want something that'll last a little while and this ain't it."
2,Such a waste of resources to make something that becomes useless so quickly!
2,Not very good
2,"Waste of money, doesn’t shave hair fine enough."
2,"Been using this for about 6 months now and have waited to give a review. At first I loved it, and it does actually work as intended however I have found I continuously keep breaking out from this. I’ve tried cleaning it multiple times but for some reason it continues to cause bad breaks outs. This last time I used it, it has cause a really bad rash on the right side of my upper lip and it hurts to touch. At this point I will no longer be using this product. I did give it two stars as it does work as it says, but I think of you have sensitive skin like I do I would very much use with caution or find an alternative route."
2,"Very frustrating, it just stopped working.  yes, I changed the batteries.  out of the return window."
2,This is the second Finishing Touch I’ve purchased.  The first one lasted quite a while but this one turned into trash 3 weeks after I purchased it.  The head of the “razor” won’t stay on - I have to hold it in place while shaving.  I compared the head of this one with my first one and the design is different.  What a disappointment - won’t be buying one again.
2,I have this same exact product that I bought from Sephora and it works really well.I got a second one from Amazon and it does not work the same. The head of the device is unstable so it doesn't stay flat against the face. Disappointed with this purchase.
2,Didn't do a good job - missed a lot even with multiple passes.
2,"I am disappointed that this doesn’t do a better job of removing hair. You are supposed to use a circular motion, but it just drags on the skin, and you have to go over the same spot several times. I do not recommend this item. I gave it 2 stars for looks, and because it will eventually remove hair if you have the time and patience to stick with it."
2,Complete waste of money
2,Are used my sisters and really liked it but when I ordered mine it didn’t remove the peach fuzz nearly as closely to the skin. In fact I was really disappointed with it but it was too late to return it. Consistency between products not there
2,I purchased this based on reading a lot of reviews for different types of these.  I regret making this purchase.  It doesn't do much of anything.  It removes very little.  It seems more to squash the hairs as you're rotating it over and very little is actually removed.
2,Broke after 3 months and it’s not like I used it all the time. My last one lasted way longer. I’m pretty disappointed
2,"I've been tired of plucking long hairs for a while now, so thought I'd try this. I did the circular motion and kept it moving, but ended up with a few pimples. The hair seems to grow back thicker, so it's more noticeably if I don't do it every day or so."
2,I bought this 6 weeks ago and it just died. I think I used it twice. Battery life should be longer than that!!
2,Product did NOT do as expected … very disappointed
2,"Review title pretty much explains it, but I used it once before I went out of the country and once when I got back. Tried to use it yesterday and it made a rough noise, died and won’t charge or turn on again."
2,"I was very disappointed.  honestly I had medium hopes, not high hopes for a basic shave of some fuzz and a few whiskers here and there, but you can go back and forth several times and the same hair is there.  I would not recommend."
2,Totally a waste of money.  Doesn't work.
2,Works well for small areas. Bet battery weak after about 6 uses and about a month.. Only mild sensation with use.  Not very effective for thick hair.
2,"This does work well but seems to ""stall"" even when new. I used it maybe 7 times and it stopped.Changed the battery twice and tried cleaning to no avail. I would not recomend"
2,"I first noticed this was uncomfortable to use after I washed my face and let it completely dry and it was still tugging my skin. I used a light so I was able to see the hairs but it just wasn’t getting everything so I was getting irritation early on from having to go over the same surface a few times. After I finished I rinsed my face with cold water and a few minutes later my face became very itchy and a slight burn. About 30 minutes after my face was screaming at me, it was blotchy and itched tremendously. I am diabetic and suffer from fungal acne when my skin doesn’t like something I’m doing so yep the fungal acne came . I would not recommend this to anyone with any sort of skin sensitivity."
2,Hair grows back fast & they say it doesn’t nick but it does... very disappointed
2,Doesn't work good..
2,This product is easy to use and works well with peach fuzz hair but any hair coarser doesn’t shave well. It takes quite a few passes for the little razor to catch the hair and then it leaves some stubble. I use this along my hair line on my face and it’s essentially useless. I wouldn’t recommend this product.
2,made in china and not good
2,It stopped working. I changed the battery thinking that was the issue and nope.... turns on but doesn’t make a noise or anything.
2,Clogs and doesn’t clean easily. Rendered useless in less than a year.
2,It’s just a small electric razor. It didn’t get the finer hairs and it’s not a very close “shave”. Not what I was expecting. Disappointed.
2,Not good. Yes it eliminates hair for a day maybe two then you get course stubbles. Does not work as well as other electronic razors. Small touch ups probably ok or for travel.
2,"This is a painless and very easy-to-use facial hair remover. However, I only used it a handful of times and now it no longer works. I tried replacing the battery with brand new batteries yet it will still not work. This is disappointing since the product can no longer be returned. Money down the drain. Not worth it!"
2,"I liked this product—while it worked. But it stopped working after 2 months, about the time the return window closed. I replaced the battery, thinking that was the problem, but it still barely moves. So disappointing:-("
2,"Irritated my skin, sorry I bought it."
2,This shaver is not as good as other brands that I have purchased.
2,Did not work for me at all.  Did not even remove fine hairs.
2,It worked at first but not very satisfied.
2,Barely lasted a month before the head stopped working
2,Not great for very small or detailed jobs. The tip was bulky. A smaller or interchangeable tip would have been more conducive to eyebrow shaping/ touch ups. Easy to use and compact.
2,"Not close to the skin at all, I tried it for little blonde peach fuzz and all it did was cut them shorter and irritate my skin.  I should have returned it.  Don't waste your money."
2,Worked great till it broke after a month. Very unfortunate.
2,"This would have been a five star review because the product worked great. However, it suddenly stopped working today. I went into my order history to see how long ago I purchased it and it has been almost exactly one year. I had hoped it wouldn’t break so soon, but sadly it did. Debating getting another or finding a new brand. I used it 2-3 times a week."
2,This looks cool but really doesn’t work very well. I’m pretty disappointed. Not only does it not get all the hair but doesn’t get close either and it catches and hurts if you have any bumps:( definitely not the best out there. Barely does the job. Also doesn’t have a way to empty or clean it that I’m aware of.
2,This product stops working after 3 to 4 weeks. Really poorly designed. This is the second flawed flawless I bright. Very disappointing. Waste of money’.
2,Couldn’t open the bottom to place the battery inside!I can’t say “easy to use “ !!
2,My sister bought this product and recommended it to me because I am postmenopausal and I have a mustache at times. When I used the product I noticed that within a few days the hair grew back darker and thicker than when it started and I was very disappointed that it grew back so quickly and darker than it should have been naturally. I would not recommend this product to anyone who is postmenopausal or is having issues with dark hair on their face as a female because the effects of the product do not last long enough and they cause more hair growth in the end
2,This stopped working completely after a year of using it sparingly and Amazon would not accept it as a return due to the time expired
2,I’ve used mine less than 10 times and it no longer works. Very disappointing to spend my money on something that does not last.
2,This product was great for the first 3 mos.  Now it dies constantly.  I have changed the batteries 6 times in 3 weeks and no power. It's obviously the product and not the batteries.  Can use this product at this time.  Very disappointed.
2,This product does not work at all you can't tell if the hair is being removed. Not happy at all with this buy.
2,Good but if the battery die so doesn’t work with another one.
2,item completely stopped working after owning it for 2 months. i only use it once every couple weeks and it still completely stopped
2,"After two months it stopped working, and I can't get in touch with anyone."
2,"Stopped working after using three times. I  put new batteries in it, cleaned it, and it will not work beyond a few seconds. I would not recommend this."
2,Not impressed
2,Had this product less than a year.  Now it's pulling the hair and snagging.  Painful!
2,"I had to buy a new battery, the one that came with it was dead."
2,Does not work as easily as shown on TV. It burnt my skin directly below my eyebrows
2,This model did not work as well as the rose gold one.  Not sure why. Multiple passes to trim hair necessary. Was used before perhaps?
2,Don't work like it's said to work
2,This product took me good 2mins to get a single hair strand out near my eyebrows. I couldn’t get the hair out for some reason. It wasn’t good for facial hair too. May be a faulty piece?
2,"Good idea. Works okay for lip area, not so much for the chin. I bought this in hopes that it could replace waxing, but doesn't do a well enough job for me. I am a black woman, so perhaps my hair is too coarse for this. May work better for finer hair. Also, it tends to cause small bumps / irritation. I'll keep it as a backup plan."
2,Died within 6 months not a battery issue just wont work
2,It only worked two times after dying.I used it for the second time after the warranty expired.Now it fails to power on. (already tried with new batteries).
2,"This product stopped working after 30 days. It is not the battery, believe I shall buy a new head to see if that works."
2,"Totally misses many hairs, no matter the length or direction in which you move it. And sometimes a I feel tugging on hairs it hits"
2,"Leaves stuble behind not close at all, the head broke after 2 tries. Not worth it."
2,"After using this twice it felt very itchy and rough for me. It states for sensitive skin, did not work well for me."
2,"Everyone raves about this product but mine didn’t work.  Very disappointing.  Sadly, it was returned."
2,The end is indented and does not cut properly. Very disappointing.
2,It's just a razor with a small head.  Not particularly effective.
2,Head clogged with hair after one use.. can not clean it and the removed head will not refit
2,Stopped working after two months and of course I can’t return it
2,"It removes a little bit of hair, but not like I had hoped.  I have to go over the same area repeatedly to actually get it to work just a little bit.  Also it seems like the battery is going dead or it’s just defective after only 3 uses as it removes less and less each time.  I wouldn’t recommend.  Spend your money on something else."
2,"Battery runs down quickly, unit gets hot and I think it is garbage and a waste of money."
2,Battery life is HORRIBLE
2,I used it twice & it stopped working even after putting new batteries in.
2,"Just an okay product.Also, I was sent the wrong color. Requested Coral and got blue.Overall Unsatisfied."
2,This is my second one.  I bought this in Oct 19' and it died within a few months.  I replaced the battery so it does run but it doesn't remove the hair at all!  My first one at least lasted a longer.
2,It did not work when I got it. I’m not sure what’s supposed to spin or move but I just heard the sound of it when I turned it on. I have to force it hard on my skin for it to cut anything. Maybe I just got a bad one
2,Does not work well at all
2,Did not like the product. Not user friendly and did not work for me.
2,"The first shaver I received did not work properly...the switch needed to be held down in order for the shaver to work and I had to change out the battery that came with it. After writing a negative review I received a second shaver within 3 days. The second one works as advertised, so I guess I can give it a good review."
2,Good product but battery will run low fast. Mine broke and I’ve only had it for 5 months. I put new batteries in but it won’t work once the top piece is on.
2,"#1  I love the rose stone roller#2  I enjoyed the basis hair remover the result was great, make-up went on smoothly#3  I loved the eyebrow hair remover.Please note that the switches on all these products are so cheap that they don't function properly. I was so frustrated I ordered several, for me and as gifts, the facial result is wonderful but if they can't make a higher quality product they're worthless.  I was an idiot not to return, I just figured I got a bad one and bought another one, never again. 6 of these products do not work."
2,"I was in love in the beginning but after two uses it was horrible. I was using in my armpit and it would get my loose skin. If yoi jave loose skin like me, then I don't recommend."
2,It seems to be nothing like the one that I had for over two years 😯this one I’ve only had for 2 months and it died ! I put a new battery in it and it still does not work!!!! I feel like it’s not the same like it’s a fake... very disappointed ... somebody needs to tell Amazon....
2,Only had it a couple months and it quit working. Only used it a few times. Put a new battery and now it doesn't work at all. Waste of my money.
2,Leaves skin very prickly. Don’t get
2,This product lasted for less than a month. Pretty disappointed the motor in it stopped working.
2,I have sensitive skin it felt like a man's razor horrible and it gave me skin irritation.
2,"this is a good product that leaves skin smooth but after a few uses it seems to have the same effect as shaving (duh) and the hair comes back what seems to be thicker & more noticeable.. I suggest tweezing or threading first, then going over with this product to catch any extras you might’ve missed."
2,Love this item--- in theory. But it has stopped working--- and replacement parts are about half the cost of the item itself. Not a good investment.
2,"Got the wrong color,  gotta press hard."
2,"I have sensitive skin and fine hair. this did not work on one past and any area that I went over more than once broke out into a rash, then it just stopped working.  Tried new batteries but still just wont work."
2,After three weeks it quit removing hair. It’s like the head is already dull. I cleaned it out and replace the battery. No luck. I personally don’t think it’s worth the money.
2,"I had this for a week now, so far,so good.I have very sensitive skin and I didn't see any reaction after use.PLEASE READ UPDATEUpdate after using two more times,my face broke out so bad around that area.I use astringent after use and now I don't know how to clear my face up from these massive  bumps will be returning."
2,No good! It let your hair grows thick and coarse! No good!
2,Not the best tool. I don’t like the circular motion type shaving tool. It hurts when your hairs get in there and it’s not very thorough because your hair has to get wiggles into the machine for it to get cut. Get the other type where you just shave it straight
2,"sometimes works, sometimes doesn't. Seems like it is a switch problems."
2,Used on excess hairs on chin and lip. Doesn’t work good on brows
2,"The design is nice but the quality of the item seems cheap. It has a weak motor/battery operated that sounds like it's running out of steam from the first time I used it. Not as smooth over the surface of my skin as I expected . Would not recommend . I guess you get what you pay for , this time it was a waste of $20"
2,Does not get a close shave. There will always be stubble. Definitely not like shaving at all. Basically wasted my money.
2,This item came with a broken piece. Still works but broken tube.
2,It's ok. It barely trims the unwanted
2,"I thought I would give this a try to see if the ads were anywhere near accurate.  For me, they were not.  I have a rather difficult place on my chin where I want to get rid of the hairs there, and this item did nothing to rid me of them.  I tried several times with no luck.  So I'm disappointed to say the least."
2,I didn't even try it.  I open the box then read the instructions.  That should have been told first before I ordered it I had to waste my time sending it back.
2,Does not remove hair well.. not worth it..
2,"If you have stiffer facial hairs, it doesn't work well."
2,Something is wrong here I tried to find where to put the battery but can't.It can't turn on for some reason.I need my money back because it's not working.
2,Does not work good. Hardly removes peach fuzz on the face
2,"This product worked well for about two months.  And it was only used about 3 times a month - so 6 uses and it stops working.  I changed the battery and it still doesn't remove any hair although, the motor is running.  To need to replace the head after six uses seems ridiculous.  And additionally, it gets very warm when turned on for just a few seconds.  I don't know if this was a defective one or not.  Of course all of this occurred AFTER the return time had expired.  I would NOT recommend - there are different brands that I believe work better and are cheaper."
2,It smells SO BAD. Like eggs and death. My boyfriend was so grossed out by the smell he didn’t want to use the bathroom. It didn’t even work that well. It was okay but it missed large areas
2,this product literally left burns on my body wherever i used it and it was insanely sensitive and painful for days after
2,It stained my bathtub brown 😭It worked though. So if you decide to buy make sure to use it outdoors.
2,"It works fine, but smells horrible. I found a few spots that were missed even though they were covered. I would rather just use my razor. It takes longer with this process, smells bad and doesn’t fully work"
2,"I have sensitive skin and this left a rash, the smell was very intense and it lingered in the bathroom after I was done using it, it also dried up my skin."
2,This product did get rid of my hair but it smells like rotten eggs. I used this on my legs outside and came in the house after I had washed it all off. The entire house somehow smelled so bad for the rest of the day. If you aren’t bothered by smells then buy this. I would rather shave than do this ever again
2,Didn’t get rid of stubborn bikini line hair. The smell lasted for hours. My husband thought I was hiding a dead body in the bath tub. I still would use it again if it worked perfectly but sadly it didn’t.
2,"So, I saw this on tiktok and tried it. It does work well for hair removal (bikini) but I recommend trying a ""test area"" for each hair removal zone! (I burned both armpits because I did the same time as bikini area. Don't do what I did! Ouch! Test each zone individually).However, my entire home was filled with the worst, most disturbing smell we have ever experienced! Exactly like a septic tank & required 3 scented candles to eliminate the stench. Air your place out well!"
2,so nasty smelling and burnt my skin
2,This smells AWFUL. My whole house smelled terrible.
2,"It works. Definitely gets rid of hair. But smells like if a dog ate a rotten egg and shat it back out. Takes so much longer to apply than it does to actually shave, and smells terrible. Sure, it works, but at what cost? Everything i own now smells like rotten eggs. The towels i used, rotten eggs. The shorts i wore, rotten eggs. Unless you are unable to smell, DO NOT use this"
2,"Leaves a disgusting residue on skin, very drying and doesn’t remove hair in the time frame it says to have on skin."
2,Smells absolutely awful and the smell lingers. I kept it on for the time told in the directions and it didn’t make any big difference so not worth it to stand the smell. I don’t have a lot of hair and I tried it on my legs and very dissatisfied.
2,Will literally burn the skin off your fingers if you don’t wash it off well. This is a very harsh chemical and smells horrible. It does work just be cautious and error on the side of less time than more time. Wash your hands very well after applying
2,Worked okay but the smell was so bad I won’t use it again. My whole house stunk.
2,They only thing wrong with this is the scent it smells like death and poop but other then that it does what it says it’s supposed to do I however will only use when I’m desperate for a smooth finish
2,This is the WORST smell!! It stunk up my whole house!! Use it outside if you purchase!
2,This product has the worst smell!!! It didn’t even remove my hair 0/10
2,"Oh my god the smell. It made me  nauseous it was so bad. In addition to that, it left me patchy and irritated. Not worth it imo."
2,"Apart from the smell, this product isn’t really worth the hassle, in my experience. It did not remove hair in a way that lasted any longer than shaving and it took much longer and was far messier."
2,"got the job done, just didn't like the smell"
2,Giving low stars because of the smell. My whole place smells like it afterwards. It’s awful
2,Left it on a small patch on my leg for 6 minutes and wiped it off and there was no hair! BUT AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL SMELL FILLED MY ROOM AND STINKS NOW!!!!
2,"I had to return this. I know it's normally not pleasantly scented but this stuff literally stunk up my entire almost 1000 ft apartment. Smells like rotten eggs, and didn't clear out for quite some time. It somewhat worked, though. Still some stubble but not too bad."
2,Hardly worked. Smells disgusting
2,Worked great to remove hair but the smell was awful! I read that it smelled but I was not prepared for how bad and lingering it was.
2,"As soon as you open this, it stinks very bad.  It stunk up the house and it was horrible.  When I went to wash off, I felt burning and when I was done my legs were very red and hurt so bad."
2,Worst smell ever
2,"Very drying and smells horrible, no matter how much you try to clean up or mask the smell it will make your bathroom smell like rotten eggs for DAYS. it does get rid of hair, but it sometimes takes multiple attempts, and it’s just too messy. Used this a few times but it was too much work than it was worth so I stopped. You can find a better product than this."
2,It works AMAZINGLY. Just do not get if you have weak stomach to nasty smells cause this stuff SMELLS LIKE ROTTEN EGGS. If you can bypass the smell it actually works wonders.
2,i had seen this product on tiktok so i decided to buy it. i couldn’t get past the stench of this stuf to put it in my other leg. made my whole room and bathroom stink. it’s worse than nair. stick to shaving
2,I soooooo wanted to love this.  People complain about the smell which I mean isn't pleasant but not unbearable.  While I think it softens up the hair folicles to remove the skin for me it didn't remove the skin I had to shave afterwards.  But for my hands I should have wore gloves it dried them out so bad they still haven't recovered and it's been a few months!
2,"The smell is SO terrible, it will smell up your entire house like rotten eggs!"
2,Smells terrible. Not worth the effort if your a woman.
2,"This product didn’t work for me. I tried it on my legs- twice. I tried it one day with no results. The next day I tried again, and still no luck. The smell is awful too."
2,Didn’t work well and smells bad
2,"I made this kinda thick because my leg hair is long. I get ingrowns and bumps rather easily. My leg hair isn't exactly fine but not thick either. This was pointless.. took quite a bit off but my legs are NOT SMOOTH at all. Stubbly and not all of the hair is gone.Never gonna use it again, unless I just want my legs to *look* shaved but they are NOT baby smooth like others claimedALSO, this smells so bad I was nauseous from the horrid rotten egg smell and I have a strong stomach too."
2,"Defiantly takes all the hair away, it’s pretty fun actually. But the smell alone is so bad I could never use it again.  My boyfriend and I got into a fight because of how bad it made the whole house smell."
2,It smells terrible and burns. Removes hair decently but I’ll stick to shaving
2,"I saw this go viral so I was dying to test it out (even though I had been warned about the smell). This was the worst possible way for me to remove hair. The smell was one of the worst things I had ever experienced, like low tide and rotten eggs combined. I have semi-sensitive skin and experienced some sort of burning rash a few minutes after applying. When I finally wiped it off I was expecting a really clean finish but found that it only removed about half of my hair. don't even bother with this stuff. it's more time consuming than shaving and doesn't do half as good a job."
2,"this smells absolutely horrible, like my entire house smells like rotten eggs. this was fairly difficult for me to get off and it left a white residue on my skin and dried it out. hair was still left and just overall disappointing however it didnt burn my skin so i guess that’s a plus"
2,"Had it on for 3 minutes and started to burn. And I don’t have sensitive skin. Also it smells putrid. It no work of a lie made me throw up. It works but it isn’t worth it, I’d rather use a razor or get a wax."
2,IT SMELLS. I don’t have sensitive skin so idk if it’s bad for that but it’s smells so bad. It smells like rotten eggs and whatever it touches smells. My whole house smells nasty. The best place to use it is in the shower but you’re supposed to let it dry then wipe it off with a cloth. I used a cloth and now it’s ruined and smells. I put it on before I showered and it wouldn’t dry
2,"This stuff works great! But, smells Soooooooo bad!"
2,"as i’m sure many of you have seen, this product went viral on social media recently. everyone seemed to love it to i figured i’d give it a try. INSTANT regret. i’m 7 months pregnant so it’s hard to shave my legs and i thought this would help me. while it did remove the majority of hair, my entire house smells like something died in it. in no way did i expect this tiny can of powder to pack such a pungency. not to mention, my legs do feel very dry and not “clean” at all, even after scrubbing with a loofah. if you’re looking for a way to get your family out of the house or prank someone, this will do the trick! for hair removal, never again."
2,"This did its job but in the process it destroyed all my silver jewelry and made my house stink so bad it was nauseating. I love it as an alternative for shaving my legs but I would not recommend using it without gloves, and sod it OUTSIDE!! The chemicals can destroy ceramic, silver, and probably more!"
2,THE SMELL IS SOOOOO BAD doesn’t really work and made my legs super itchy
2,"I know, I know, I'm another one of a thousand of the same complaint.To be fair, this worked, and I have pretty thick coarse hair, but oof the smell!! Worst of all, the scent lingered for days. My husband told me if I ever want to use it again, I should please only do so outside, yikes!"
2,"Yeah it works, but if you have a sense of smell it is not worth it!  It smells like a mix between nair and rotten eggs--honestly, my husband thought we had a gas leak the smell was so bad."
2,"oh my god. so i bought this because of Tik Tok (as I am sure most of us did) for my body hair and it was god awful. the smell was absolutely DISGUSTING and it lingered in the bathroom for hours after. in addition to this, it makes such a mess and it isn't even worth it because it did practically nothing for me. I tried it on my legs, pits, and arms to try to give it a fair shot and the only place it kind of worked was my arms. overall, I regret this purchase. it's a miss. the only reason I even gave it two stars was because it is typically meant for beards but still."
2,"Don’t let TikTok convince you this works, it doesn’t."
2,Not a fan - smelled bad. Burned my skin. Tarnished a ring that I had on my finge
2,the actual product does remove your hair but.. it smelled my entire house up like rotten eggs and the smell didn’t go away for hours.
2,This stuff stinks and directions didn't make anything but stinky liquid so I had to keep adding rotten egg powder. 10/10 DO NOT RECOMMEND
2,it stinks up my whole house. it’s a good product but if you gag to smells easily i don’t recommend at all.
2,It got most my hairs off in their defense I was really impatient with letting it dry. But the smell was so bad it made my whole house smell bad.
2,terrible smell & irritated my skin
2,THIS SMELLS SO BAD. IT SMELLS LIKE ROTTEN EGGS AND I COULDNT STOP VOMMITTING. I have never smelled something to make me retch but it was awful and my entire house smells like rotten eggs eggs.
2,"This is all the hype right now so of course I wanted to try it!I haven't used something like this is years, which was Nair and I had a reaction.Was scared to try this but reviews seemed good.I left it in for the next amount of time and it did seem to work some, but left a few patches behind. Not sure if I was too thin in those areas but it seemed like I had a good layer.The smell is HORRIFIC though.If you can do this outside or with a window open, do it!It's a mix of burning hair and rotten eggs and seems to smell worse the more it dries!I closed the bathroom door and left BOTH of our vent fans in and over an hour later I could still smell it and when you walked through the front door the entire house stunk.I've used the creams and they don't work quite as well... Need a little more dwelling time and more product, but I'll take that over this smell!"
2,a little scary to use. and the smell was so bad that i thew it away.
2,this product was an absolute disaster. followed the directions and got razor burn and a sticky residue that won’t wash off after 4 showers. does remove hair but leaves a sting and terrible razor burn
2,"Smells horrible, doesn’t give a smooth shave for me, just shortened the hair"
2,It definitely makes your legs smooth but it’s not worth the smell. It stunk up my ENTIRE apartment....
2,"As a woman, this worked great for my facial hair since I have PCOS. But the smell is horrific and smells like rotten eggs. I would suggest applying outside or else your house will smell like it for days. I tried applying to my legs and it got them smooth but didn’t last longer than a day. Also applied to binki area and it did okay but I still had to go back in with a razor to get off the excess hair. Also if you have to use this daily or every other day I don’t think it’s worth the value, even when it is $4. I’ll stick with shaving unless I want baby hairs removed."
2,Works but my legs were itchy and sore after. Smells horrible. DO NOT WEAR SILVER JEWELRY!!! The sulfate oxidizes the silver and turns it a goldish color
2,This stuff smells like a rotten egg times 10. The smell was so bad and lingered thru the entire house for hours. It did remove hair well but will make you vomit while using it.
2,"This technically works. It just makes your entire house smell like a skunk died for several days. I did get some minor burns from it, and it took forever to dry. My main issue is the smell though. By the time my house smelled normal again, the hair had grown back"
2,"worked okay, but beware if you are wearing silver rings the chemicals in the product will ruin them, i’m totally disappointed but the actual hair removal was fine, make sure to get good coverage."
2,"this stuff smells and is an absolute mess, it does work though i just believe it’s not worth it at all itwas hard to wash off and got all over my bathroom, but the smell is the worst part my house smelled like eggs for 2 days"
2,"My husband has sensitive skin. Not a good choice for him. He was hoping this would work on his neck, it irritated it really bad. The smell (which was mentioned) was not pleasant."
2,It didn't work for me and the smell is awful.
2,"It works, but stinks so bad that no one could possibly stand to use this on a routine basis."
2,"This powder smells so bad I had to throw it away. It was obnoxious. I really wanted to like it as many reviewers spoke so highly of it, but I couldn't get past the scent to even apply it to my legs to try."
2,"This product stinks... literally. I used this on my legs, and it filled the ENTIRE house with the most putrid, disgusting smell in the universe. My husband came home from work and then immediately left because he couldn't bear to be anywhere in our house with the smell... He came back several hours later and the smell was still just as strong as ever. It wasn't until the next day that the smell had finally dissipated. On top of all this, the product didn't actually remove my hair very well. They were smooth the night that I used it but the next day they were prickly again. Only reason I don't give this 1 star (instead of 2) is because they issued a refund."
2,"What a disappointment!  I found no moisturizing features in this product and, frankly, just threw it away.  It was too much of a hassle to return it."
2,It has a smell and dye . I tried to like this but for my skin I need to pair it with something else. I wore it under my makeup but it made my makeup more dull. I think because I use a primer. This is not my cup of tea.
2,"Felt great, did what it was supposed to but made me break out worse. Not for sensitive skin."
2,I opened the box and took out the jar and when I carefully unscrewed the lid the product was very loose and ran out onto my dress.
2,"It wasn’t a good moisturizer :/ it irritated and turned my smile lines red and felt a burning sensation. It never applied well either; after it was done drying, it would easily roll off with a gentle rub and leave white specks of the moisturizer. Really was hopeful for a good product from all the reviews but no luck with this one."
2,"This was a no for me. It did not moisturize for me. It also bothered my sensitive skin. Worst of all it stung my eyes, and eye drops did not soothe them. Perhaps it works for less sensitive eczema prone skin."
2,Have used for a couple of weeks and have not seen any improvement of moisture on face. Neck or chest.
2,"Not sure if this product works or not-the smell was too much for me to handle. Made my eyes water and my face/neck felt itchy, but that could have been from my eyes watering so much. I used it 2-3 times and had to wash it off every time."
2,"Works okay, works okay under makeup if you put your foundation on before it dries.  Broke out my skin in many places  so I  stopped using until skin cleared then starting using again and same thing as before, skin broke out in many places and this was without wearing a mask all day. Scent is nice but too loud for me."
2,"I love the unscented gel-cream version of this product, but the scented water gel gave me the worst break out I’ve had in years. I’ve since switched back to the gel-cream and my skin has cleared up again."
2,Smells and irritate my eyes
2,"I applied this product to my face about thirty minutes ago before going to bed. Not only does my face feel like it’s burning, the fragrance is so overwhelming that I think I’ll actually get out of bed to wash my face.I definitely won’t be using this again.I’ll never understand why companies add so much fragrance to their products. What an incredible disappointment, not to mention a complete waste of money."
2,"The cream bottle arrived on time ,but the bottle contained no seal pack in fact when opening the lid I suspect the cream was less in content."
2,Doesn’t seem like the same formula as the last one I brought in drug store.
2,I don't consider my skin overly sensitive but this product was a no for me. It left my skin feeling like it had been burned. The skin under my eyes got very irritated. The cream itself is also very tacky.
2,The scent makes me sick. I have asthma and couldn’t breathe. I had to wash it off!
2,I don’t think this is the same formula. I love this product but my skin has been heavily irritated and burning since using it. Could be I’m just becoming allergic to it but I’m still using other skin care products with the same labeled ingredients with no issues.
2,Gave me a terrible allergy on skin
2,"Not a fan, doesn’t give a creamy moisturized feel, feels sticky"
2,"This product is absolutely not for sensitive skin. First of all the fragrance is way too overpowering, and it burns my face! I’m really disappointed in this product."
2,This product basically burned my face and caused it to start pealing. Did not feel moisturized at all. Would not recommend.
2,Too harsh for my skin. Broke my face out.
2,"Completely disappointing.  It did not restore or hydrate my skin.  In fact, my skin was drier.  The scent was pleasant but much too strong.  For me, this was a complete failure and I am returning it for a full refund."
2,The formula is very watery and makes my face burn when it is initially applied; it feels refreshing the 0.5 seconds while you’re applying but it made my skin feel dry minutes later.  It doesn’t feel like I’m applying lotion because the product is so thin.  This is my fault that I didn’t read the ingredients but this product has a scent to it that lingers and while not unpleasant I don’t like my face products with a scent especially one that hangs around.  I will not be repurchasing this product especially for the price.
2,Received my Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel and as I opened the box realized there is no tamper-proof seal. The box has no tape and there is no seal under the lid. I'm not sure I'll use this item as it feels very unsafe.
2,It feels soft but it burned everytime i put it on face. I have sensitive and dry skin. For that was looking for something that will suit my skin. Thought this might be it but left me with disappointment. Won't recommend to those who have sensitive skin like me.
2,felt silky soft but did not absorb well
2,"My skin is fairly sensitive and it did not work well with this moisturizer! I have heard a lot of good things about this product but sadly it didn’t not work for me. It made me break out and while my skin did feel moisturized, that feeling didn’t last long."
2,"I don’t have sensitive skin, but this product gives me a burning sensation on the skin under my eye. I have no idea why it does that, but I have read other individual reviews on this product and I am not alone. Other people with non-sensitive skin have also experienced this."
2,I have sensitive skin and this was a disaster!!!!! It burns so badly!!!!! I would not buy this again.
2,"I bought this back in Oct and waited to review. I have combo, sensitive skin and eczema. I used this for about a week in Oct and thought my skin was just getting used to it. When applying it gave a slight burn but did make my skin feel supple. After a few days though my skin started breaking out, which it doesn't do often. So I went from applying day and night to only at night. That didn't work so I stopped using it for a while. I started again in early Nov and it started out OK again. It's now week 3 and my skin is burning again, I've been breaking out really back, and my eczema is really bad on my face."
2,I'm not sure if my skin needed this product. Didn't see a change or difference.
2,After using this product for a week I got these very strange dry spots dotted all around my face but especially under my eyes(I didnt use on my eye area) that almost cracked. I didnt change anything else in my routine so this was very strange. It could be that I have very sensitive skin or it didnt react well with other products that I use but it still was a shame that it didn't work out the way I would've liked.
2,I thought this was going to be my new holy grail moisturizer bc the hand cream and the exploiting face wash was amazing on my skin.. but this actually dries my skin out pretty bad. I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong 😬 but I always have to go with an additional moisturizer after I use this bc that’s how dry it makes my skin unfortunately
2,I don’t like the intense smell of this crime. I don’t use it because of it.
2,"I have very sensitive dry skin, and after reading the many rave reviews I bought this. Doesn’t work for me. After I put it on, within seconds my skin was inflamed and it felt like it was burning. Washed it out with cold water. I had angry red splotches all over my face that stayed for nearly two days. Not meant for sensitive skin."
2,"I was really excited to give this moisturizer a try after reading so many positive reviews. However, after a few days of usage, I started getting these dark and dry spots around my chin. I thought it may have been the new toner I was using so I stopped using that. But these dry and dark spots would not go away while I continued using this gel. I stopped using the gel after a week and started using my toner after a few days.... And my skin is back to normal with no dark and dry spots. These spots were so embarrassing because they also were itchy and I felt like it looked like dark facial hair spots! I have combination skin so not sensitive, but whatever is in this gel, it does NOT agree with my skin. I switched to Aveno lightweight  moisturizer and I have had no issues. I'm very sad this didn't work because it smells nice and the rest of my skin seemed okay, but no thanks."
2,"I have mild rosacea, after many years of diet changes vitamins and what not, that used to be severe. I tried this after having some great luck with a Hyaluronic acid serum. Last time I ran out it was unavailable so I tried this after reading reviews. It hydrates my forehead very well but caused my rosacea to flare up from temple to temple across the middle of my face and down on to my chin. A bad flare up, mountainous red pimple-like things, flaky itchy skin, the works. I couldn't cover the red no matter how thick I tried to apply makeup, color correcting prime you name it. It was a full fire engine face. Stopped using it and only used my go to vitamin e oil and it cleared up in two weeks.Use with definite caution."
2,"I truly don't have sensitive skin, but I was looking for a more hydrating moisturizer. It did hydrate — a bit. But it also brought my pimple-less skin to a pretty bad breakout within a week — I had about 15 new pimples that first week. The claims of noncomedogenic must be false. It also smelled awful, so if you don't like scented moisturizers, do NOT buy this."
2,Had to return. The is NOT fragrance free as stated☹️
2,"I never leave reviews. This is the first time I do. I was excited to try this based on the great reviews. First couple of days it felt nice on my skin. I have dry skin so it felt like it was doing its job. After a week, one morning I woke up and I broke out badly. Like never before I’m my life. It’s not even an exaggeration. Besides having dry skin, acne was never an issue. I would get maybe one or two pimples every now and then, but this broke my face in multiple places. I’m returning this product. I’m gonna try this product and buy it from their website. I noticed online on several websites (Ulta, Neutrogena) that the price for this product ranges between $22-$24. It made me question why it is so cheap on here. Maybe it’s not legit."
2,Thought I had found a good moisturizer and a change from what I have used for years.  This cream burns and stings on my skin.  My skin broke out due to harshness.  Tossed it out and will not be buying again.  Too tough!
2,This product is very smooth and easy to use but severely dried out my skin. I will not be ordering again.
2,I usually use Revlon Regenerist. But it leaves my face feeling greasy. I thought I would try this as i have heard good things about it. But NO! It does not help moisturize my face. A while after applying it my face feels real dry again. What a waste!! Will Not Ever buy again!!
2,Why put blue dye in this product? Totally not necessary. Would not have purchased if I knew this ahead of time. It’s just okay. Nothing great. Skip it.
2,I wanted to love this product so bad. My sister in law recommended it so I thought I’d give it a try but sadly it made me break out so bad. It smells great and for the first day or two it felt great on my skin. Very sad my skin did not like it
2,"Why are we still putting fragrance and dye in skincare products? If I wanted to smell better I'd put on some extra deodorant and cologne, but instead I'm forced to suffer through irritated burning skin for a day after foolishly overlooking the ingredients on what could otherwise be a great product. Use the gel-cream instead."
2,I have dry skin and this gave my skin an intense burning feeling to it. I immediately returned it. I was so disappointed.
2,Not impressed
2,"I do not have sensitive skin and I have very mild acne. Usually I have no bad reaction to lotions, but this one stung on my eyelids and cheeks. It was moisturizing on some of the areas of my face, but it stung to bad so I stopped using it."
2,Product came with box that was already opened by someone and damaged.
2,"I was finishing off with my second jar which I bought both from Target. So I decided to buy my third jar from Amazon. Guess what, I think it’s fake. The smell are terribly strong of chlorine. The one I bought from Target printed Made in Canada, this one doesn’t say where it is made in! I don’t trust this to put on my face so Im returning it. !"
2,"Made  my skin bumpy and burned a little when I applied. Not a good fit for me.Skin type- acne prone, sensitive, combi"
2,"I mistakenly ordered the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel, thinking I had ordered the Gel Cream.  I was so disappointed because I had it sent to my son's residence in Ohio where I was going; wanting to avoid costs of baggage.  Thinking it was the gel cream which I do use because it is unscented and works for my very dry, aging skin, I didn't look at the box which I had thrown away so when I opened up the jar I instantly knew because of the smell.  So, unfortunately the jar is sitting on the counter in Ohio as I write this because I couldn't use it and I couldn't return it.  Lesson learned!"
2,Worst face cream / moisturizer. Like putting think water on. Useless.
2,The box the product was in was battered and ripped where you usually open it at the top- which means the product was opened. It also had a plastic wrapping around the box that shows it came in bulk with 2 other boxes and it just looked so unprofessional. The product itself works very well (yes I risked it buy still using it even though it obviously looked opened because I am too lazy to go through the return process) so I gave it one more star.
2,I'm not sure if I just got a bad product but not at all moisturizing.
2,"I really wanted to love this product because so many people rave about it, but...no. I initially felt like my skin was softer, but I also started breaking out after using this gel moisturizer. I even took a little break from it just to see if it was really the product's fault, and it in fact was.It could've just been me, but issa no for me, and it will probably be a no for you if you have sensitive skin."
2,Have been using it for a month but haven't seen any results. I feel like it's gotten worse!
2,"Disappointed with this product. I bought it because I have dry skin especially in the winter. I have been using this for almost 2 months now and have noticed no change, my skin is actually more dry now..and red which doesn’t usually happen to me. They also give you such a small amount for the price. The product smells good that’s about it. Oh well i’ll keep looking for something that works."
2,"It burns my face to no end. For some reason when I use it in combination with anything with collagen in it, my face will burn. It hurts!!!! So much!!!"
2,Returned due to no seal.
2,"This product is a waste of money, it does not work."
2,IMO not that moisturizing and if this is unscented I seriously cannot imagine how the scented version smells. I think it has an awful scent. Won't be repurchasing.
2,"My face was still dry after using this lotion, and I hate how it smells."
2,The product came really fast. It is smooth and soft texture with cooling effect. What i don't like about it is that the package seemed to already use or open before shipping out to me. It is not like a brand new product.
2,"I don't know if the formula was updated, or if I grabbed the wrong product... but the water gel I had been using was unscented, and it wasn't actually blue. This stuff has a scent that reminds me of kitty litter :( I'll tough it out and use the rest to not be wasteful, but I won't be buying it again."
2,"I have combination oily/dry skin, so I thought this would work pretty well for me. Unfortunately it caused my skin to flip out. I don't break out a lot normally but after using this for about a week my entire face was covered in pimples. After discontinuing using it for a few days, there are no new pimples and the old ones are fading. This was the only new product I added into my routine so it couldn't have been anything else."
2,I looked up the ingredients and they aren’t really the best especially if you’re pregnant
2,"I was under the assumption that this would fix the texture of my skin, fade fine lines, and smoothen out my skin. it just an expensive moisturizing oil. There has been no changes what so ever. The smell is not to my liking at all. I'm only 25 days in, zero results. I'll keep using it, but I'm cancelling my seasonal subscription."
2,Waste of money
2,Idk what’s going on. I been using this oil since my pregnancy started. My belly has no stretch marks nor my left boob. But my right boob! Is developing stretch marks all over. And i apply it freely.It’s upsetting.
2,"Not the real deal, leaves you extra oily.. quality not as good.."
2,"Not sure about other areas for stretch marks but I was using this for my breasts. the stretch marks have always been there but they are more noticeable since I stopped taking birth control and lost a cup size. I used after the shower daily and massaged for about 20-30 seconds but all I have got in the past month is breakouts all over my chest area and on my breasts. I have never ever had a pimple on my breast and I have had 3 so far, just on my breasts. My whole chest broke out like I had said before. My stretch marks are also lighter than my skin tone so I am not sure if this is just to lighten, but did not help me."
2,It gave me rash in in my pregnant belly. I might use it later on my legs that the skin is not that sensitive
2,Didn’t notice any improvement on my scars
2,It feels good when I applied on the belly but I still get lots of stretch marks. Keep using and no improve so far.
2,Arrived unsealed in torn box. I don’t feel safe using this.
2,Not so great leaves behind a residue
2,"I have used this product two months already, it just like the ordinary face oil, it didn’t turned out as the product description said, so I went back to check the review that rated one star , from there, a lot of people mentioned it was fake."
2,The smell was a complete no for me. Couldn’t continue using it because of it. Might just be my pregnancy nose.
2,Comedogenic. Not for acne prone skin. Stickier than you may expect. Clogged pores within two days. Caused more problems than it solved.
2,"Initially excited and appeared good, but sadly disappointed. I thought this would be great to use to moisturize my belly during my first pregnancy. I ordered during the first trimester and waited to use it until the second trimester as it says on the bottle. I enjoyed the smell, textured seemed good for moisturizing but after a couple of uses I noticed my belly getting REALLY itchy every time I used it. At first I thought it was just dry skin but it was only on my belly. Unfortunately the return window has already closed because I followed the directions and didn’t start using until the second trimester. Very disappointed."
2,Hate the scent. Can’t stand to use it because of the smell.
2,"Contains mineral oil, processed from petroleum oil, from crude oil, from natural gas."
2,I've been using every day on pregnancy stretch Mark's. It seems like it lightened them a little bit. The smell is wierd. But it's okay. Not too impressed . But it does have many uses
2,UGH I cannot stand the way this smells - I gave it away.
2,I got this product in November 2020 and I used this religiously every night after my shower. It’s February 2021 and my stretch marks look the same. Sad face 😞 time to try something else.
2,So not worth it. Smell horrible did not stop my skin drying out
2,"I think this product is okay. The instructions say to apply twice a day for 3 months to see results. I’ve been applying twice a day for about 2 weeks and think I can tell a slight improvement in the stretch marks. However, the bottle is almost gone and will like only last another week. It is VERY messy, it takes a long time to absorb into your skin and leave residue all over the bathroom counter. The product may work long term but to me wasn’t worth the mess. I will not be ordering again, wouldn’t recommend."
2,I use this product for stretch marks throughout my pregnancy. In my opinion it helps if you don’t want to get stretch marks but doesn’t help remove stretch marks.
2,ordered this & when I received it the post was already open and smushed. It smells kinda nice though. But the packaging is terrible .
2,Sent it back because I didn't check the ingredients until I got it and found out it's main ingredient is mineral oil which clogs your pores and can cause other skin problems
2,"Didn't see a difference, if anything my skin was even dryer due to lack of moisture"
2,"So I bought this product to use for my stretch marks and I have been using it for almost 2 months and at first I really thought it was making a difference and I bought the bigger bottle, but i regretted it.  I looked at the before and after photos and saw no difference, I thought that at least I would avoid the appearance of new streaks, but even that didn't do it.  Disappointed"
2,"I wish I had read more reviews for this...what I received was a fake. There wasn't any documentation in the box, no seal on the bottle, it's very runny and smells funny. So disappointing!"
2,This gave me a rash . Would not recommend for sensitive skin
2,Don’t know how it works in sensitive skin as I don’t have that.But I want to clearly tell people it’s not going to eliminate stretch marks. The marks can’t be eliminated I read. I bought it only for that fear so didn’t use more than 5 times and sold
2,The product came looking as though it was tampered with or already opened. There was no seal and the top was tearing.I’m really a bit skeptical yet it’s going on my hips so I’ll try it and keep u updated on a product review
2,"I'm fairly certain this is a counterfeit product. The box was damaged and not sealed, and it even says ""Do Not Use Product if Seal is Broken"". I'm pretty disappointed as I was hoping to use this on facial scars from a recent dog attack."
2,Used the whole bottle and there is no improvement in results
2,I bought this for my growing belly and stretch marks when I became pregnant.  I dont really like the smell and its really greasy to me.
2,"I bought this to prevent and help heal my stretch marks, but a lot seems off. I use the smallest amount, and it’s still INCREDIBLY oily and never sinks into the skin, and i normally use a regular body oil as a moisturizer. It made me break out in a HORRIBLE rash on ALL of my stretch marks for weeks, even after stopping use it remained and I had to use prescription steroids to make it go away.  I do not have sensitive skin at all and this was the worst reaction ive ever seen! Ive seen reviews that this product is fake, so im going to assume mine was, since it did absolutely nothing but cause me pain and itching. Im going to buy straight from Target for comparison."
2,I feelUneasy because it doesn’t have a safety seal
2,I just had a baby and I’ve been using it since before and it hasn’t helped at all . I actually see more :(
2,I was acne free but had scars from previous acne and  I used this twice today and I  broke Out. Imma try it out to see how it  works in terms of scars but so far I know I do not like it and this is only day 1. I will be back to review
2,"02/24:  I just got the 2oz bottle today and it smells wonderful! It absorbs just as well as coconut oil!I am about 19 weeks pregnant and put this on my breasts due to the stretch marks that just appeared. Aside from my breasts, I'll be using this Bio-Oil on my belly and thighs to help prevent other stretch marks from appearing.I plan on updating this review throughout my pregnancy. Really have high hopes for this product going by the reviews!03/05: Sadly, I'm going to have to stop using this product. Rashes have formed in the areas where I've applied this oil. The worst ones were on my breasts where I've applied the most oil. Maybe I used too much product? Either way, I'm going to use coconut oil in place of the Bio Oil. At least until my rashes go away and I'll try again at a later date."
2,"Don’t like it. Smells weird, and made my skin itch"
2,I guess I’ll be the unpopular vote. I have read so many wonderful things about bio-oil but I did not find it moisturizing. I would give it one star because it did nothing for me but it didn’t give me a rash so I suppose it deserves two stars.
2,"Feels really smooth, but made me break out anywhere I put it. It could just be that my skin is sensitive to it, but I don’t feel like it was breathable enough, I use coconut oil as lotion/moisturizer all the time and have never had any issues."
2,I was excited to use this oil but the scent is very off putting... makes me nauseous and gives me a mild headache. I'll use up the bottle but won't use again. Can't recommend if your'e sensitive to smells.
2,"Idk if this is real, makes my skin itch. Causes red bumps."
2,Works okay to moisturize skin. No decrease in marks/scars and I’m 85% of the way through the bottle.
2,"I was really hoping to like this and I just don't. The smell reminds me of a worse version of that Avon skin so soft from 10 years ago. It's not the worst but it's not great either. I did have a few problems with it that make me regret buying it at all.One it does not absorb into my skin so much as sit on top of it. It makes it impossible to use it under makeup because it stays greasy all day. Even using only a few drops all over my whole face is somehow too much.Two I had to stop using on my face after a week because it was giving me horrible blackheads.Three it did absolutely nothing for my stretch marks. There was no change in color or size.Four it was drying out the skin on my face. As oily as it is, it was only covering up dry patches, not making them better.I will admit it did lighten a burn scar on my chest, but only a bit and it is by no means gone. I get different people have different skin but it just didn't work for me. I'll probably keep using it on the stretch marks and the burn until the bottle runs out, but I don't expect much to change. I will 100% NOT use it on my face again."
2,"I see no difference, bottle says to use for 3 months it’s been about 2"
2,This product in particular didn't really work out for me. I kept it for 6 months and I didn't really see great improvement. It just broke me out more when I did use it.
2,The oil clogged my pores and broke me out more
2,Did not see any improvement. The stretch marks have even worsened
2,Don't get your hopes up
2,"I don’t have the most sensitive skin at all! But I am having really bad rashes (I thought because of my stretch lines). I figured I needed more moisture.  I use Palmers Whicht calms my skiing irritation but the stretch lines are not going away. So when I read the reviews I figured it will go away without 3 weeks. Every time I apply it, although the scent is good, it causes a bad irritation on my skin so I have to start all over. Did not work on my skin."
2,I bought this product because the reviews are great but it didn’t work for me. I used this oil through out my pregnancy and after delivery but there is no change in my stretch Mark's at all.. they are still there. It might work for others. Not for me.
2,Does all the things it claims until it comes to reducing the visibility of stretch marks. I do use it for dry skin & as a daily regiment but since I purchased & used it as directed I’ve seen no change in stretch marks until I switched to Palmers stretch marks lotion
2,Bio oil is basically adult baby oil :/ . I bought this just to try and help remove some scars I have on my hands and some stretch marks from my last pregnancy. I had a bad reaction to a cleanser I was using and it let me with a bad burn mark . I tried using this on all those problem areas and nothing . Not even a slight fade .
2,"This oil is supposed to minimize scars and I’ve been using it  for about three months now. I had banged my shin badly on a marble shelf and was hoping it would help the healing process. Once I investigated the ingredients and realize that the main component is mineral oil, which is engineered to keep from penetrating the skin, it made sense to me that I was not detecting any changes in my scars. Even though mineral or oil is toxic, I will continue to try to use it on the small space to prove myself wrong and hope that it will take away this ugly blemish on my shin. If I remember I’ll come back and update my review but for now, no change."
2,Didn't really do anything for me. Really disappointed. Did not see any changes
2,"Buy this for my wife dark spots in her face , after 3 months of every day use, there was no improvement"
2,I got this product hoping to fade some facial acne scars and lower body stretch marks. I have dry skin and have used many oil based products on it before. I put small amount on my chin for the scars and the next day I had acne popping up all along my jawline and an itchy rash extending down my neck as well.I will say that I used it on my stretch marks and there was no reaction - hence the second star.
2,"I didn't expect much knowing stretch marks take time to fade overall and there is very little you can do about it, but I think this maybe marginally helped? Would I recommend it -- No.I mean I think that it's kind of bad if you can't notice something at least minimally different after 4/5 bottles...."
2,Smell made it hard to use. Very Fragrency.
2,Wasn't a good buy didn't do what it thought it did
2,I have been using the product for a while now and there is little to no improvement.
2,I seamed to be allergic to this possibly.
2,Didn't work. Used it for about 6 months but noticed no change in my skin so I stopped using it.
2,"I’ve been using this for a little over 3 weeks with no results, not even minor improvement. It says to use for 3 months 2x per day so I will continue in hopes that it will show results. But after reading reviews on here that products might be fake. I’m starting to get a little suspicious. Will adjust review if anything changes, but if you are expecting quick results this definitely is not the answer"
2,I don’t believe this is the actual bio-oil. I have been using it for months with no effect
2,"wasn't the original bio-oil you can get at drug store or Walmart, not as good, skip it"
2,"I was so disappointed after reading all of the good reviews. My face broke out almost immediately and I don't typically have trouble trying out new products. I kept this product and add it to lotion to use on my feet at night, which is working out."
2,Not that good.  Been using every night for a month and stretch mark is not going away
2,"I liked this product at first. I'd heard good reviews about Bio-Oil.  I'm not sure if this one off Amazon really is fake like other reviewers have claimed.  My experience: I am very sensitive to smells and get sick of most smells very fast, yet this smell was fine for me.  I thought after a week I already saw some improvement on the stretch marks on my arms.  (These are my oldest and lightest scars) However within that same week of use my pregnancy stretch marks became incredibly itchy and I developed a rash.  I don't have sensitive skin either.  After this I came back and read the negative reviews and saw others had the same reaction.  I won't be using it anymore, but might consider trying once more if I see it in an actual store."
2,I love the smell but I have a reaction to it every time I put it on. Unfortunately cannot use.
2,I broke out every time I used this. I'm not sure how to use it now to get rid of it but it's sat in my cabinet since purchased. I used it 4 times.
2,"I dont really see it helping with my skin or stretch marks, i use it daily too and I still have stretch marks and pain from abdominal stretching."
2,I really didn't see any difference after using this oil on my stretch marks. It also smells weird and could possibly stain clothes if you are not careful.
2,"Nothing Natural about it, contains too many harmful chemicals"
2,"my skin very itch after using it. i stopped to use it and change to use mustela, skin not itch at all When using mustela. after mustela finish, I tried Bio again but feel itch again!  😣"
2,"Toxic for me, not worth putting on your skin."
2,"I am not satisfied with this purchase because the oil feels different from what I always use. Besides that , the oil I received doesn't resemble the one I purchased.  Packaging was different too."
2,I’ll stick to the ones I usually get I got these because I seen someone do a review on them.  Saying they are cheaper & work just as good at the ones I usually get but I didn’t like them & I used them up quicker then the usual ones so.  It’s a no for me
2,"I didn’t like the product so much, just for the fact that what the suction of pulling puss from a pimple is what it’s supposed to do. It barely does it. I had a large pimple that I wanted gone but the next day and it was still red and had puss. Looking at the patch is like expecting there to be more puss, but I was disappointed."
2,Had promising reviews but these are the worst I have tried they do not work at all
2,"I was really disappointed by these. They don’t stick very well at all. I often have to waste patches before one will actually stick on to my skin. They work, but only if u can get it to stick on. These are cheap, but they don’t compare to higher end brands (like mighty patch). This is one thing where you get what u pay for :("
2,They didn’t do what they advertised i put it on my pimple left it for the time it said& when I removed it instead of it removing with the pimple residue it completely ripped off my pimple & it also hurt to take off it felt like tape being yanked off. I tried it a couple times on different pimples it just didn’t work for me.
2,"I ordered this for subscription because of their rating. Bad idea-they look good & clear, but fall off after 1-2 hours. Really poor stickiness, the most important factor. I thought buying USA product/company was a good idea. But they are worse than the cheap ones, will NOT purchase again. Went through 20 in 3-4 days, these are only good for a few hours. Major dissatisfaction for what I expected to be a better brand. I’m going back to Rael for their quality. Averelle is very poor quality overall."
2,"Didn’t see any difference as a matter of fact , it kind of irritates the pimple instead of drying it."
2,I’ve used them twice and didn’t notice that they did anything. They are easy to remove and adhere and my skin is sensitive and they didn’t seem to cause any irritation.
2,Don’t stick as well as other brands. All stickers are the same size which is another bummer. Have used multiple brands on Amazon but these patches are not worth it.
2,"They did not work for me. Used these on deep pimples, pimples that I could have popped and there was no white stuff on the patch when I removed it 8hrs later. Didn’t make a difference in the pimple at all."
2,"Used this for my acne and found that while it sucked a minuscule amount of oil out of some of the acne the majority it had no affect. These stick super nice, come off easy, blend in pretty well but didn’t help my acne much unfortunately."
2,Not as good as the pink and blue MY PATCH brand from WalMart (also sold online here). Probably the worst acne patch I’ve tried so far. No difference when I woke up sadly.
2,Have tried multiple times with following directions and have no results.
2,This product doesn't barely does anything to helps pimples except hide them and lessens irritation.
2,These patches I didn't see any results from them. They did not stick well to my skin or my boyfriend skin either. I left it overnight on a pimple and saw no results.
2,I have used these about a week now. I have Cystic acne I've tried it on them and haven't seen any improvement.
2,"This item did absolutely nothing for my acne at all. I had 2 noticeable zits that were very close to the top of the skin. So I put these on each of them. They stuck well, that’s for sure. But when I removed them the next morning there was no change whatsoever in the appearance of the zits. Disappointed for sure."
2,"I constantly break out around a certain time of the month so I'm always looking for good patches (I tend to pick at my acne). These are cheaper than the ones I usually get, but now I know why: they easily come off, or they hurt like hell when I peel them off. They'll do the job until they run out but I won't be buying them again."
2,Not sure how I feel about this product. I gave it to my preteen nephew and there were NO immediate results as claimed .
2,So I’ve used other companies pimple patches and they have don’t disappointed but these did 🥲. They do not stick very well 😢😢
2,Not as effective as advertised.
2,"I’ve used several brands of pimple patches but decided to give these a try because I’d seen them online. They did not work. Normally, if you put a patch on overnight, the pimple is gone or reduced by the morning. Not with this patch. I tried them several nights in a row on the same pimple with no result. Will not purchase again. Pimple patches work, but not this brand."
2,Did not help with blemishes at all. If anything it may have made them worse. Feels like you’re just putting a strange textured bandage over the pimple/blemish. When you pull it off the plastic backing sheet it folds to the other side. Will not be purchasing these again. Very over priced for no reason.
2,These work much more slowly compared to the other brands I've used because I find I use more patches than normal to get a full extraction ...i would not recommend this brand. I'm gonna go back to that brand with the pinkish red box.
2,Patch doesn't fully conform to face. Seems to have no real effect other than preventing you from touching the spot. Wore them for more than 6 hours at a time and only change was less redness
2,"These patches had the worst adhesion out of any acne treatment patches I've ever tried. They never stayed on all night, and did not work for me personally. I wouldn't waste my money on this product again."
2,"I had high hopes for these, but they didn’t work at all for me.  I’m disappointed in them and won’t be purchasing them again."
2,I get PMS acne and combination skin. I do not get too oily though. I have tried these on a couple different size pimples and I cannot get them to stay on my skin. They just slide right off or I have to keep pressing them down to stay on. I do see some places where the patch turns white like it is soaking up the infection from the acne but it is so annoying they won’t stay on. I will not be buying this product again.
2,"Dude, this is tape. Zero healing potential because it's essentially glue. Not worth the time effort or pain of removing bits of tape off of your face."
2,"These don’t work. I have cystic, hormonal acne and these did nothing. They do adhere quite well. So what I do now is put on my pimple medicine, place this patch over it then wear it overnight. Not sure this makes a difference but I hate to throw them out. I won’t ever buy these again."
2,Would not recommend. The mighty patch and Clearasil patch works so much better. This patch may work for white heads but that’s about it. I saw no reduction in redness or size. This patch does not penetrate deep like the other patches I have used. Much of my acne is deep in the skin. I tried this patch multiple times across different types of acne and was not impressed at all.
2,They don’t stick so well or really suck out the fluid. Back to Rael Pimple patches I go!
2,Sticks well but isn’t effective at all it was like putting tape on your skin no results
2,"Didn’t work for me..but I did use it after the  blemishes *popped*, it seemed to calm the irritation down. It also was a pain to keep on, the adhesive needs work."
2,"Was super excited for this product because it was supposed to be for the type of acne I have, but I put it on over night and nothing happened... I've tried every night since and it done show any sign of clearing... so sad"
2,"Many of these ended up folding or sticking to themselves within the package even though I put them in carefully. So they were all wasted, so far they have done nothing for my zits."
2,Patch was pointless and actually broke me out more
2,"I’ve purchased wireless mouses before and they all generally work as expected…not this one. There is no “on-off” button or switch, it jumps around on the screen despite using a mouse pad or a dark colored surface and the scroll wheel sticks a little. I’m going to go back to the brand I normally purchase when I need a wireless mouse."
2,Not sure how this got good reviews but it’s a struggle to use. It’s very jumpy and stutters A LOT. It isn’t smooth on the screen at all. Not worth the money.
2,I didn’t like that it didn’t have an on/off switch like others I’ve had too. It was cheap feeling and kinda sucked
2,"Definitely a quiet mouse, but I put it in my work bag every day and the biggest flaw with the product was that it didn't have an 'off' switch. I typically put my computer on sleep mode, but if the mouse was accidentally clicked inside the bag the computer would turn on, heat up and drain battery. This was a flaw I could live with by removing the USB. But then suddenly the mouse stopped working, and it was not battery related. I have replaced with another product. Very disappointed."
2,"I first bought the lavender version and I loved it.  Worked perfectly.  Then I got furious at something unrelated and flung it across the room.  It still worked but not as perfectly.  I figured an upgrade, a new color.  This new one makes me so angry.  It's been 3 months of pure frustration.  The pointer floats and drifts making it nearly impossible to work some nights.  I wish I'd never ruined the first one and not wasted my money on this piece of infuriating JUNK."
2,So I have not had this for a week and have already killed a battery.  It has no off button so when you put it into a bad it keeps on working.
2,Crapped out after 9 months.  Worked great until then but not interested in replacing my mouse at least 1x per year.  Disappointed.
2,"i loved this mouse for the first month or two, but after a while i noticed, while playing games it would glitch and make me look up or down. now it has completely stopped working, tried changing the batteries multiple times but it's completely dead. i guess it's fine for the price, but this is not a good long term use mouse if you're using it every day.  also when it's on, it emits a bright red light, which i was disappointed on because it kind of ruined my aesthetic on my desk and was not listed on the product description."
2,"I got this at the beginning of April and at the beginning of August, it is already malfunctioning. The mouse location on the screen lags or moves erratically when I try to use it. Disappointed"
2,"Looks nice, feels nice, but the cursor is jumpy and I can never get the mouse to point to the things it should.  The cursor on the computer screen continues to move all over even if the mouse is completely still.  Useless so now I have to buy something else :(. Don't waste your money"
2,No on/off switch... kinda sucks... really inconvenient. Will have to spend more money to purchase a new mouse!
2,"It was quiet, but it made the cursor jump across the screen. I also did not like having to click to wake it up."
2,First of all it's a lot thicker than it looks in the picture. The color is also not a bright as it seems in the pictures. The worst thing of all is the mouse is fickle as hell. Sometimes it's takes several clicks to browse to another page and it makes the cursor move with a mind of it's own. Definitely not worth 20 bucks.
2,"I bought this at the end of February and now it's the beginning of July and I'm experiencing issues with the mouse. It would always jump around or move on its own, which is very frustrating. It was a decent mouse until now."
2,"It gets two stars for being quiet, and cute. The accuracy difference was notable compared to my Logitech mouse but that’s to be expected given the cost. Unfortunately I dropped it the other day and now it randomly moves and the accuracy is non existent which basically makes it worthless. It was cheap, but it should have been able to withstand a single fall from the desk. I’m bummed."
2,"worked fine but broke after a few months, just stop working..."
2,It seems to lag behind when you move it and it actually gets is not good
2,"Worked great for 3 months, and then starting using batteries very quickly before it ultimately died. Fine if you need a cheap mouse for the short term, but not worth it for long-term daily use."
2,"Purchased for my daughter to use in her 3rd grade class. Price seemed good for something being sent to school, but then within two months is completely stopped working. It doesn’t have an on/off switch and is supposed to automatically shut off but somehow that didn’t work. Tried new battery and still no luck. Only had it two months and then it went in the trash and had to buy another one."
2,I don’t recommend this product for gaming because the curse occasionally does actions that you didn’t intend.  Stability control needs to be looked at by the designers of this product.
2,Have to use more pressure on click buttons
2,"Tracking skips around. We use it as a TV remote, so its only slightly bothersome. Would NOT use as a computer mouse. Too frustrating."
2,Most broke after two months of using it for work everyday! Wont buy this one again!
2,Cute but did not last long. Thought the battery just died but now it won’t stay on for more than literally two seconds. Can’t get it to work anymore. Less than 6 months
2,"Started off just fine, and love the stylish color! But after 4 months, started sputtering out with less and less battery life, and signal became intermittent. Now at the 5 month mark, it is useless even with full battery, alternating between making crazy jerking movements and being totally unresponsive. Since I sort of need to not click random things while I'm working and type into the wrong windows, etc, this is worthless. Just another piece of e-waste."
2,Feels cheaply made and no off switch
2,"Mouse works ok at the beginning of use.  But after using it a while, when maybe the internal components get warm,  the cursor begins to drift.  For those who are wondering, my mouse WAS NOT on a non-flat surface and physically moving. That was the first thing I verified.  The mouse was on a flat surface.  Also, the problem has occurred more than once.  So I am returning it."
2,"not well constructed, a lot of gaps..."
2,I loved this product so much when I first got it a month ago but now it is glitching and jumping around the screen whenever I move it. I was so sad about this because it matched my keyboard perfectly. But I can’t even use it anymore as the mouse jumping while I’m trying to work is extremely frustrating!
2,No off button
2,You get what you pay for.  It stopped working soon after I got it.
2,It just died after 6 months. It worked really well when it did. But there was nothing I could do when it stopped working.
2,"This mouse has a few issues. It causes the cursor to “jump” to different areas on the screen randomly. This is usually a minor annoyance but once in a while you’ll accidentally close out of a program because the cursor ‘jumped’ to the X. It’s also a very small mouse and causes fatigue in my hand from using it all day. I have small hands, but the mouse is still disproportionately small. Perhaps if you’re only buying it as a backup or travel mouse this will not be so much of an issue.The one significant pro for this mouse is the battery life. A single AA battery has lasted me almost a year of consistent 8 hour a day use.Overall I do not recommend this. If you can afford to, spend a few extra dollars to save a lot of frustration and discomfort."
2,it worked for like 2 months and then stopped connecting to my laptop :/ + you had to disconnect every time to turn it off
2,Maybe find a different product.The first one I got didn't work at all. When I got the replacement it was really good... for a few months. Now it constantly stops working and I have to unplug and reconnect at least a few times every hour. Irritating while gaming. And I keep getting notices about it malfunctioning. I can tolerate its issues for now. But I wouldn't buy it again.
2,I like it because it matches my keyboard cover I dislike it because the back closure is loose. It's not too comfortable for working on the computer all day.
2,Love the this but I hate that it doesn't have a off and on switch.  I have to switch the batteries at least every 2 weeks.
2,"Colour is as shown in pictures. Unfortunately, it gives trouble to connect and when it does, I can scroll and move the mouse but not click."
2,"No one and off switch, so light is always on in my bag."
2,"I bought this mouse to replace my old one which lasted 10+ years. One week in and I hate this thing. Walk away for 10min and it falls asleep. Wiggling it will not wake the mouse up. Instead you have to bang it on the desk. Second, if you want to highlight something the mouse will stall and stop highlighting in random places. Would never buy again. On my way to buy a new one right now."
2,"It looks beautiful, but doesn't have sleep mode and it only worked for two months, then it stopped working. not very happy about it"
2,"I like how light it is and how quiet it is when clicking. But it doesn’t work well at all. Tried replacing batteries, the light went out and it just didn’t work."
2,It worked well at first but it stopped working after about a week.
2,"There is no on/off switch so it goes ""dormant"" when you pull the usb out of the computer and put it away, but not right away. It also goes dormant if you haven't moved it in a while, and you have to click a few times to get it to wake up. I bought this around cyber monday 2020, it is currently mid march 2021 and this mouse is basically useless. I'll drag it to the left at a slow speed and 3/4 of the time it shoots off to the right at a higher speed than I'm moving. It goes dormant more than it works, and when it's active it doesn't go where I'm dragging it to. It worked great when I got it, but burned through the battery quickly. After I changed the battery, it started going crazy. I've already ordered a different brand as a replacement, and will just have to eat the loss on this one since it's outside of the return window. I don't even use this daily, only 2-3 times a week, so who knows how fast it would stop working correctly if I had a real desk job."
2,"I really like the mouse at first but all of a sudden the mouse stopped performing the click action on my laptop.  The mouse cursor moves but when I try to click on something it doesn't click.  I tried new battery, tried it on a new laptop but the mouse is malfunctioning."
2,This mouse is horrible. It works but barely. It goes to sleep quickly so you have to slam it for it to start working again and while using it the curser jumps around without moving the mouse. Would not recommend purchasing!
2,"The mouse shuts off for sleep mode and I can’t get it to come back on. I have to take the battery cover off and take the battery out and put it back in, and then it will work. The mouse sometimes quits working in the middle of using it. Very frustrating."
2,Worked for about 6 months. Now the cursor is erratic with its movement. Past the window of replacement. Disappointing because I like it’s feel and size.
2,"Title is self explanatory. It's nice and worked well for the first 2 months or so, but I have cats and due to the way this thing is designed (it has a lot of empty space) fur and dust can easily get into it and mess up the sensor. Every time I try to use the mouse the cursor goes haywire. Probably wouldn't recommend."
2,This mouse was good for about 3 months. It then stopped working. Disappointed it didn’t last longer. We bought two and they both went bad about 3 months after we bought them. I recommend spending a little more on a higher quality name brand mouse.
2,"Stopped working in a month and a half, even with new batteries and everything. And while I’d used it, it would occasionally lag. What a bummer."
2,"The mouse is too light, meaning it isn't heavy enough to stay down while being used. Since it's so light, it constantly comes off the surface and causes the pointer to disappear. It's a minor flaw, but it is very annoying."
2,"You get what you pay for. The mouse has a mind of its own. Cheap product, the cursor will move all over the place and is not steady at all. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve accidentally closed out of important tasks at work because of this scatterbrained mouse. Spend a few more bucks on a quality mouse."
2,Poor quality and stopped working after about 2 months of daily office use.
2,"The description says ""noiseless"". It is not.  (-1 pt). Also, I did not realize, but there is no ""off"" ""on"" switch.  (-1 pt.) I hate wasting batteries.  Does not work well on all surfaces (I needed a dark surface for it to work well -1 pt.) Although I did like the color, will probably return."
2,I bought two of these devices so my review is based on both.After a month both went out of control. It is not possible to address the pointer.Very poor overall quality. It is a disposable mouse. Very disappointed!
2,I just purchased this mouse. The mouse has worked about 50% of the time. I've tried different batteries. It still wouldn't work properly. It does not have an on/off switch.UPDATE: The mouse working only 50% of the time was a problem with my computer NOT the mouse.
2,"I'm not really that satisfied with it, I have to shake it or bang it sometimes for the mouse to start moving on my screen. If I could send it back, I would but I'll keep it until I can get another one."
2,"Stop working after 6 months andIt is supposed to have a lifetime warranty, but it was difficult to contact them"
2,"This mouse is the worse mouse i have ever bought.  It drops it's connection, refuses to wake  up the computer, and stops working when ever it wants to for any where from 5 to 20 seconds..  Would not buy again and DO NOT recommend it.  BUYER BEWARE"
2,"Well I did love it, but it has already broken 4 months later. I’m very disappointed. It’s on, new battery, but it won’t connect anymore."
2,Not very comfortable. Reaction time is slow.  You get what you pay for. Don't waste your money on this.
2,Be cautious! This stop working after a couple months...
2,It is VERY difficult to use. The maneuverability doesn’t track well. I am constantly adjusting to get the mouse where I want it. I would prefer to have an actual off button so I know my battery is wasted. The color is really the only thing I liked.
2,"Bought this 3 months ago, worked ok for the most part although even new there were occasions where the mouse would randomly register major cursor jumps, suddenly placing my cursor on one of the screen corners. A bit annoying but because it wasn't often and this was cheap I found it acceptable.However, 3 months in and now aside from that occasional jumping there's also consistent jittering in the input; sometimes registering movement even when not touching the mouse, and fighting my when trying to drag cursor in a given direction. Borderline unusable now."
2,This stopped working after only 5 months.
2,"Died within 2 months. And by died, I mean new batteries can’t even save it. I’m a teacher teaching hybrid, so I really need a reliable wireless mouse to help me change between the 500 screens and zoom easier. This one was great in the beginning, but wore out quite quickly. Disappointed."
2,"The only reason I'm not returning this mouse is because my daughter said it's good enough. I got the pale blue which is more of a grayish white no blue at all... There's no one off switch so the batteries are constantly draining. And there is no sleep mode either... I am highly disappointed in this product, but I bought it for my 11-year-old for her laptop and she's ok with it. Otherwise I would be sending it back."
2,"Bought 4 of these 6 months ago for the kids to use for their online school.For a while they worked, pretty much like a mouse should.Reviews look good enough, but 3 of them no longer work.  Waste of money."
2,"The “sleep mode” is a pain...goes to “sleep” after just a half a minute or so, and I’m always having to bang it on my desk to wake it back up again.  Really annoying."
2,Mouse is very jumpy. Curser jumps all over the page.
2,"I was really happy using my mouse on my laptop for a while but recently I decided to unplug the receiver from my laptop to plug it on a different one, and it broke in two parts one of those got stuck on my laptop so I had to take my laptop to a repair shot in order to be able to use my USB port once again"
2,"The item I ordered was not in good shape,  looks like it has had a rough life, (through the mail). It sounds like something loose in it if u shake it, also the left button doesn't work All the time!!"
2,Replaced it with another one after several weeks.  Too noisy and choppy. Not at all smooth. I should have return but I thought I would get used to it.
2,Stopped working after 3 months
2,"When the mouse works, it’s great! Then the pointer gets stuck at the top of the screen. We would have to remove to battery to reset it and it works again. At first, it happened only once in a while. Now it happens every few minutes. This happened since we got it. I should’ve returned it right away, but I didn’t want deal with returning. It’s too bad for me. For sure, not buying this product again."
2,this mouse jumps around so you end up clicking on the wrong thing.  It's annoying.
2,"I really want to like this mouse. The price is unbeatable, it is lightweight, and the click is quiet. However, it makes me lose my internet connection. I have never had a problem with my WiFi since working at home but once I plugged the mouse in, I lost my WiFi connection every 10 minutes or so. This is a huge problem as I am running virtual meetings all day long and losing my connection mid meeting. I am no longer using this product."
2,"The mouse worked fine for a little while (purchased in June of 2020), but within a few months was glitchy and the mouse jumped frequently on the screen. We thought we'd fixed the problem by changing the batteries, but within a month it was even worse. Tried it on another computer, tried cleaning the lens, but nothing has worked."
2,"I regret buying this. I am going to spend a little more and get something that would be worth buying.  Color is nice but i need mouse that can do the job effortlessly.  If you plan to use occasionally, this may work. But if you know you will use it all the time, DO NOT buy this.  Don't fall for the reviews. It is true...you get what you pay for!"
2,"I've had this mouse for just under 4 months and it's developed a drifting problem rendering it un-usable.  I've done all the appropriate trouble shooting items such as cleaning the mouse, checking drivers, replacing batteries, adjusting the settings settings and nothing seems to work.  It does the same thing on both my work PC and my personal laptop.  Nice size - good feel in the hand, but frustrating that it is not working after only a few months.  Would not recommend."
2,It lasted 4 months working fine. Started failing and contacting the shipper is not very straight forward.
2,"Loved this mouse at first! Really made using my work laptop so much easier. However, a few months later and it stopped working. I tried changing the batteries and using a different USB port but it’s completely dead :("
2,I thought it was a battery issue but even after replacing my batteries the cursor is choppy. I've tried every troubleshooting technique possible. I'm really upset because it's right before my finals and I needed this mouse to be reliable.
2,Cute but didn't last very long. Mouse doesn't control pointer well anymore.
2,The click button was broken when received.
2,This second mouse doesn't work  any better than the one I returned.  It disconnects occasionally.  Rather irritating. I dug up my old Logitech mouse to use since it does what I want it to do.
2,I have only had it three months and works crappy. The mouse doesn’t go where it’s supposed to on the screen.
2,The mouse stopped working within 2 months. When going to pull the USB piece it proceeded to fall into 5 different pieces.
2,Am I supposed to do something to them to make them work? I see no difference when I wear them. They are light enough but are they doing anything for me?
2,"I haven't used Blue light canceling glasses before this so I don't have any other experiences to compare to. They do fog up easily. I have to wipe them often with their cleaning cloth they provide. I did purchase them because they were affordable. But unfortunately, I will be having to try out a different brand."
2,"I clean and clean the lenses, but they are always grimey and covered with a film. I can’t even wear them so a big bummer."
2,I notice no difference and they don't sit right on my face. Not a fan.
2,I was very disappointed when I received this product! I only got one pair of glasses but the box it came in said two pack!!
2,"Though I have nothing to compare them too, I was expecting more blue light blocking and more anti-glare. They are lightweight. But for the forced pandemic homeschooled children who are on their computer too much now, look for better options."
2,"Cheaply made. Not clear if they even block blue light. I have an average-sized head and they were too big. Both pairs fit awkwardly, one side touching the ear and the other lifted up. First time I’ve experienced such a thing with glasses, and I’ve had plenty, even with the cheaply made frames. I give two stars for pattern, instead of just one."
2,No difference noted in wearing of glasses. Glasses did pass their enclosed testing strip.
2,Only one pair of glasses is wearable. The other pair is crooked. I'm not happy because the reason I bought this was to receive TWO sets of wearable glasses.
2,These glasses look good but my eyes hurt when using them (looking trough them).This might be only my subjective experience and might not be true for other people.I had to return them.
2,Did not work for me. Image on the screen looked the same. Lens does not seem to have any anti-glare coating. Gave me a bad headache instead.
2,"I like these glasses because they are very light-weight and seem to do the trick without being too expensive. But, one of the arms/temples came off after just about a month of use. I never found the little screw of the hinge but they were only worn in one place and I searched high and low. So now, one pair is unusable because they won't stay up without both temples."
2,Style is bad
2,Didn’t live up to the expectations...but then again it was dirt cheap
2,Suuuuuper cheap blue light glasses but if that’s what you’re looking for then you’ve come to the right place. They do the job but it’s as if you can’t clean the glass (if you can call it that). Everything builds up on them and sticks rendering them useless after a few wears.
2,Compared these glasses against a more expensive one my co worker had.  There was no comparison the one my co worker had you could see the blue being refelected out these had nothing being reflected.  I did not do any extensive tests with equipment but I would not recommend.
2,"Couldn’t tell the difference when I wore these while using my computer. My eyes were just as tired. Plus, they were kind of difficult to see through. I felt like I had to strain to read through them."
2,"Not Blue light blocking. Cute, but do nothing for screen fatigue. Maybe  I got a fake pair....do not recommend"
2,Meh
2,"A day after having them, I developed a huge scratch across the lens. How? I'm not sure. I put them on my nightstand, woke up, put them on and a huge scratch appeared. Didn't even have them for 24 hours and the black pair were ruined."
2,"Didn't fit, looked cheap and strange."
2,I showed these to my Eye Doctor and he told me they had no blocking and were useless. I would like to know what proof is available to prove they have the Blue Light blocking.
2,These don’t really work. Disappointing but I guess that’s why they are low cost
2,These fit ok and seem well-made but I don't notice any improvement in light blocking and the lenses are cloudy. Got these to help with frequent headaches but not noticing a difference.
2,Didn’t fit my face
2,Meh.  Seems to make things sort of off focus and that makes me less likely to use them. I’ll keep trying them but so far I can’t really say I can’t live without then.  Maybe that’s just how these kind of lenses are.
2,"It is light weight but the frame is very uncomfortable.You can hardly wear for an hr ,it starts  hurting behind the ear owing to hardness of the frame ."
2,Very bad glare not flattering
2,They were really small glasses and quality was not good
2,Not great. Blurred my vision. Returned product.
2,I never found out if they blocked blue light or not. The lens were if such low quality I couldn't wear them. They had ripples is the plastic.
2,Not a big fan of them
2,"It didn't help with the glare, I ended up with a headache"
2,"I was really excited about these glasses! They were a cheaper alternative to some of the expensive blue light glasses and I felt that they helped me when staring at the computer screen for long periods of time. Even if it was just mentally, I also felt that I could get better sleep with them, even though I already have night-mode turned on for my phone and tablet. However, one pair broke after a month of use (I was just taking them off my face when they did). I am therefore disappointed but I guess that is why they give you 2 pairs? I might suggest a different brand to those of you who are looking."
2,"These do not block enough blue light to make a difference on eye strain, my eyes still feel the same. The glare on these can be also very annoying, if there are stains on such as fingerprints, it’s really hard to get off."
2,These glass are very light weight but the frames are slightly narrow around my head which causes a headache by the end of the day. The glasses themselves are not the best quality and are foggy no matter how many times i clean them.  But at least it blocks the blue light...
2,"one of the two pairs has a very tight ear part. I'm not sure what is causing it, either it's the lens, or the very tight frame legs, I have had bad headache after wearing this pair."
2,"I can't even tell if these have any blue light reduction. They come with a test spot and light, absolutely no difference. Cute frames, easy to wear, but does not do what I purchased them to do. Really bummed."
2,not recommended for anyone it really decrease vision of view.it will make you blind
2,I didn't care for these due to them distorting my vision. When viewing the computer screen through these glasses everything was just a bit blurry.  I won't be using theses.
2,I don’t like doesn’t work
2,The plastic is light and feels cheap and the lenses are difficult to actually see through
2,"Not worth the money, cannot tell a difference with or without them.  My husband will not use his because vision was blurry with them on.  He could not tell the difference in ""the blue light"" either.  Disappointing for us."
2,These are pretty much useless I got them because I work on my computer a lot and end up getting headaches frequently. I thought that these would help but instead the glare that I get from them makes my headache worse and it is irritating. I would not waste your money on these.
2,"To my vision, these glasses are not clear.  When I put them on, everything becomes a little blurry.  I couldn't say if they block blue light, but I can't wear them long enough to find out."
2,"I received these and they were crooked , I tried to straighten out but they just looked off. I also didn’t like the indention in the middle of the glasses. I will be returning."
2,The product came damaged the box was smashed and the glasses are lopsided . Not sure if it was damaged during transit or coming from vendor directly but not happy with my purchase .
2,"Just like other customers mentioned, I could not see the differences of wearing these glasses to block the blue light."
2,"I'm not sure what they do, but they're not as good as other pairs I have, my screen is still blue/white wearing them"
2,"I look at my phone at night, and even with the setting having the brightness on the lowest setting, white backgrounds still hurt my eyes.  I was hoping these glasses would make a difference but for whatever reason, looking at the white background on my phone hurts my eyes more with these glasses.  I have goggles with yellow lense, so I’ll go back to using them."
2,Doesn't work that great got a headache wearing them and they hurt my ears.
2,They passed the blue light test but the quality is poor. They were light weight but the lenses were think and blurry and overall not worth it
2,"I like the LOOK of these glasses, but they don’t seem to block blue light at all. We did multiple tests. The glare is so bad when you wear them that you look silly when you’re on a video call with someone."
2,"Couldn't beat the price when these were on sale for $8.something for 2 pair. However, the lenses are so clear and with no yellow tint I find they do not help my eyes/forehead relax when I put them on. The harsh overhead lighting I am in all day really tenses my eyes/surrounding muscles and the old TIJN pair I have are yellow-tinted and immediately relax my muscles but these livho ones without the yellow tint do not make my eyes feel better at all. Unfortunately though my TIJN ones broke after only a year so my hunt for a new pair of blue-blocking glasses will continue..."
2,"Very large frames for a woman. Light weight, but I’m not sure how much they reduce blue light. I didn’t notice a difference."
2,These are not anti glare... and they came half broken. Got my money back
2,"These glasses do not have anti-glare coating on them, the lenses seem cloudy when looking through them and cause eye strain. They are comfortable fitting but the eye strain is worrisome so I won’t use them."
2,the design and quality of the glasses is nice but i dont think there is blue light blocking ... made no difference when i look at the monitor
2,"I don't like these blue light blocking glasses because my eyes get very itchy and tired after using them. I initial thought is to protect my eyes, but it is not working well. Not recommended for other users"
2,"Disappointed. :(It was obvious that the product had been opened already. The black pair had scratches on the lenses so, they are garbage. The purple pair looked untouched and I have yet to try them out... I won’t be returning because it’s not worth the hassle."
2,I need correction to read anything & since these don't come w/any magnification had to return them.
2,"Frames looked great and definitely deflected blue light, BUT lenses had scratches on them and were basically unusable straight from the box. Very disappointed in the packing that they came in; a cheap plastic bag with no protection."
2,"The glare on these glasses is so awful, they are unwearable! You can actually see your own face reflected on the inside of the lens! The glare is so extreme, it was impossible to properly see through them! So sad because the frame shape was cute and comfortable, But the glare is so extreme they are useless."
2,It doesn’t quite fit my face... I get headache after wearing them...😓
2,You can cut down on glare with these but they aren't true blue light blocking. If you want that look for Gunnar instead. There should be an obvious yellow tint to the lens to have any affect at all.
2,"Heavy glare, lenses are blurry, can not see clearly through them. Past the blue light test, but useless since it blurs my vision so badly."
2,These are sturdy lightweight but they did not help with my headache looking at the screen all day 😕
2,Not at all helpful.  Would not buy again unfortunately
2,"These glasses are not good blue light blockers. I already had a filer on my computer to try and block blue light but some still came through so I decided to purchase these glasses and when I put them on I did not see a difference. I put them on outside, no difference. I looked at my phone that doesn’t have a blue light filter and still couldn’t see a difference. Even when taking off the filter in my computer these glasses did not block the blue light my filter blocked already. I would bot recommend the glasses."
2,"These glasses seemed to reduce my headaches, but since I already wear glasses I have to wear these over them. It's not comfortable so I probably will only use them on occasions where I am developing a headache, but they do seem to work. I just don't look very good in them. I wouldn't say buy these for their looks."
2,"They seem fairly well made for the price, but...what's the use if they don't block harmful light. The lenses don't seem to be anything but clear plastic. My eyes still hurt when looking at my phone or computer screen. Waste of 15 bucks, unless you want costume glasses."
2,Too much glare and did not fit my face.  It was uncomfortable wearing.  Returned.
2,"I got these to try out, would not recommend. The ""lenses"" are not clear to look through and take on oils and smudge very fast. I got these to wear while working on the computer and unfortunately they now have ended up in the junk drawer."
2,The glasses are about what your going to get for this cheap. I've got a big head and they hurt to wear. They are kind of small
2,"The frame is too big for the face, but narrow on the sides. It hurts the ears. From lens perspective, it seems to be good."
2,"A tester is included with the glasses, but no instructions.  Eventually figured out a way to make the glasses pass the manufacturers test.  But I still doubt the validity."
2,"Used for anti-blue light and anti-strain. Seems to be ok, but the lens gets hazy and needs to be cleaned many times during the day. Even after cleaning, still a lot of residue and smear remains on the lens."
2,"These glasses are super cute, but I don’t like them because the lenses always appear to look dirty when I put them on even after cleaning them."
2,Does not protect against blue light. They dont work.
2,Cheap warped and not worth the money.
2,Definitely cute frames. But... NO fabric bag. No blue light to use with the test card. No Manuel. How would I know if they work?!
2,Poor quality material on the black glasses and it doesn’t do it’s job. Glare is really bad and it doesn’t protect your eyes from uv
2,"These glasses are very light weight and cute. The issue I have with them is they are so tight I can’t wear them for more than 5 minutes without my head hurting! The whole point of these is to reduce eye strain and headaches but these have only made it worse. I tried to bend the ear pieces back so they didn’t squeeze my head so much but they wouldn’t bend, even when I used heat they bounced right back to their original form. I wouldn’t recommend."
2,Extremely crooked and do not filter out blue light at all. Horrible glasses
2,the mouse stopped working after 2 weeks
2,*Letters on keyboard wear out really fast (within a couple of months).*Does not have any memory to hold color settings and by default you get an annoying flashing rainbow.*Company does not respond to warranty requests on their website. It's been about 4 months and still have not heard back from them.
2,"This is sketchy.My order never listed as ""arrived"" so that I was not reminded to review it.When I needed help with a problem with the mouse, the company that sells it admitted to me that they do not manufacture it despite having the exact same name.Now the enter key is chattering (double clicking) and the paint on frequently used keys is bubbling and chipping.Good if you need a cheap keyboard for a few weeks or months, bad if you expect it to last longer than the return window."
2,The RGB is the worse.
2,the keyboard died a month and a half after using it. The keys squeaked all the time then one day stopped functioning. The mouse is an ok gaming mouse for non FPS games for FPS games i find it lacking i will not buy again and do not recommend this product
2,"Keys started going out, one by one. Too bad because I really like this keyboard, or I used to, rather.  5 months, EXACTLY, to the date, certain keys stopped working.  Yes, I tried uninstalling the HID drives in Windows Device Manager. The problem isn't with Windows, as my $5.00 standby keyboard works and all keys map accurately.  Nope, it is this keyboard.  Such a shame."
2,Sometimes when typing the 0 key will spam without even clicking it. Also you encounter resistance when clicking the shift key which is especially noticeable when gaming.
2,"Randomly the P key activates the 0 key and it keeps doing it, it’s frustrating it’s only 2 months old.  Other than that it works fine."
2,"The keyboard and mouse look great! Although, I may have received a dud. The spacebar on the keyboard is very hard to press and made a ""springy"" noise as if something was loose. Not to mention, the keyboard and mouse were shipped to me in an unpadded Amazon mailing envelope. Without much confidence in the keyboard, I requested a return."
2,Keyboard seems to be working all right still. But after five months the mouse just randomly stopped working while I was using it.
2,"It looks cool but as a keyboard and mouse, it kinda sucks. Typing on it is very off outting and the mouse feels cheap and clunky."
2,"The keyboard works as it should, but the mouse sensor is trash, it keeps resenting it's location. it's about 30 mins old out of the box and it has a new home in the trash can!"
2,"The left click button on the mouse broke less than 10 months after purchase.Red Dragon support did not response to our warranty claim, disappointing!"
2,"The keyboard is function and works well, but the mouse has a broken cord. Slight movements and tweaks in the cord cause the power/signal to flicker, disconnecting the mouse and creating some serious interruptions. Even while writing this review, I have to shake the mouse to refind a bend in the cord to keep it functioning."
2,Various keys stop working 2 day we had it.
2,never had any complaints about any keyboard ever before but the amount this keyboard flexs is INSANE feels like its a paper plate.
2,"Initially I thought the product was great for my first PC build, but I started getting confused when I start up my PC and it would say that my password was incorrect before I had typed anything. Come to realize that my Enter key was constantly being pressed which is an issue I thought was software related, but I was dead wrong. The keys are controlled by really low quality key mounts. Now I have to figure out some means to get a new one."
2,"got this for my workstation because I am a gamer and I love gaming keyboards. I was not expecting too much from this because of the old adage ""u get what you pay for"". Very underwhelmed by it so far. the mouse is nice due to you can change how much DPI you want to use, but the keyboard really leaves much for want. the lighting is nowhere near as bright as shown and described. even in the dark it barely helps read the keys (maybe i just got a poor led setup?). it also came semi scratched up. nothing major to where it looked used, but it is very noticable it was not handled with care upon packaging. we shall see how it does. if you need a more economical priced setup, this should do. if you are looking for quality though, you may wanna look elsewhere"
2,"I bought this combo for working, not gaming. My eyesight gets worse by the week, and I thought perhaps this would help. But the keys are not bright enough for me and during the day the keys have such a dull color on the black that the board is actually counter productive to use. The mouse is great"
2,Bought this for my daughter for Christmas.  The mouse doesn't work already! the keyboard still works but mouse is totally dead already. Only lasted 3 months! What a waste of my money!
2,"In the event you actually buy this, keep in mind finding the drivers in completely nonsensical. Nowhere in the packaging does it call your mouse the proper name to actually find the drivers, changing any of the side mouse buttons doesnt result in a nice gradient for turning your volume up or down, even a soft tap bumps up volume rapidly, basically making it useless for anything, including the preset of forward or backwards on a page while browsing the internet. Did you misclick and want to go back a page? Too bad! Tapping the button will bump you back to Netscape instead of going back a single page. If you are broke and need a mouse and keyboard this will do just fine, if you want an actual quality product though look elsewhere. Even for the price, the hassle to find the drivers and the inability to customize sensitivity of the side buttons, its a waste of money. I fully intend to refund this."
2,"This was for my grandson and the letter keys stopped working. Since it's been 30 and the hassle I went thru last time, I can't even return it. Very disappointed!!!"
2,"Unfortunately, a few keys are hard to push down. The shift is the hardest to push and make a loud clicking sound when pushed. Besides that I’m not a huge fan of the lights, even though I thought I would be. Controls for volume required two button push instead of one. It does have a few extra buttons I do like though. If the buttons didn’t stick I would say this was a good keyboard and mouse set."
2,This started off good but failed after just a few months use. Spend more money for a keyboard that will last.
2,"Bought on 06/27/20. The mouse works great and so did the keyboard until just recently (02/2021) certain keys (K, P, and some others) stopped working, while majority of the key works... The issue is intermittent but is annoying."
2,"first month the mouse gave away, second month, the keyboard stop acting up. I threw away and get a real gaming one."
2,The mouse began to squeak the second day I used this product. The keyboard keys also began failing with a week of using this product.
2,Bought one.  It was dead on arrival.  Replaced it with the same unit.  It died 6 weeks in.  It looks cool.  Amazon gave us a credit. WON'T buy this brand again!
2,"Loved the feel at first but after very minimal use the ""="" key started spamming randomly and I had to adjust it so it would stop.  Not a deal-breaker and since I don't have time to use my computer much during 2020 I just didn't worry about it.  The right shift key stopped working today and unfortunately, I'm a right shift-heavy user with the fact I've only used the computer about 20-30 times in the past few months I don't feel like I might have gotten a dud keyboard.  Looks like lots of other people are having a good experience, but I guess you can't win them all."
2,"I doubt I would rate it as low if I hadn't just had to deal with Amazon support telling me I must have messed it up the day it arrived.  Several keys work sometimes, but mostly dead.  A couple, left shift and main enter keys, are completely dead.  Would have tried another, because it is a pretty cool keyboard, but Amazon support wanted me to jump through a million hoops, including dealing with manufacturer support, for something I just received.  Returning.  Very disappointed."
2,"The mouse is good but the keyboard is not. Lights do not get very bright and a lot of the buttons don't work and stick down and do not pop back up. The video keys are junk and won't come back up at all. What really bothers me, the key layout. It's not the same as the other keyboard and feels awkward and you have to search for the key that's not where it should be on standard keyboards. Last gripe, when you type, the keys are very loud.Bottom line, buy something else."
2,"It was quiet, it had a lot of light settings, but the lights would revert to flashing rainbow every time I restarted my computer.  It was distracting, and I returned it."
2,"My keyboard hardly functions. Every time I try to type bear P or 0, it’s goes crazy. This keyboard is possessed and has been messing up work life. DO NOT RECOMMEND. It will randomly insert a ton of zeros and will never stop. I may have gotten a defective product, but I wouldn’t trust it!"
2,"I liked it, it was light weight, flashing lights... I thought it would be a good replacement for my very old Blackweb (I loved that Keyboard, and it's still going strong.) I had to replace that one because my new sitting set up, it was to big and bulky for where I was gaming now, also they don't make Blackweb anymore or I would have gotten a smaller Blackweb.My problem is now the Left Shift key doesn't work with the Z key anymore at all (I have to use the cap locks key to get a big Z), it works with all the other letters, and I can't use the Left Shift key with the Enter Key anymore, I have to use the right one which is weird. The other thing is the Right Shift Key won't Capitalize the Z key either.  It's not like I use that letter often, but sometimes I do... and the enter thing is a pain in the butt. I won't be getting this keyboard brand anymore... I am sorry but four months and it's breaking... I am not even that rough or hard on my keyboards.  The mouse is also starting to get shoddy to... not always working I have to unplug it and plug it back in."
2,My husband key board and mouse stop working after just the month check urs after getting it to bad we can return it bc are return plice say after 1 month cant return o replace
2,Sadly the mouse and keyboard both lose the rLast place they were once shut down.You have to reset the mouse speed every start up unlike any other brand I have used.The keyboard rbg settings always get reset for some odd reason.
2,Mouse laser died after only 3 days. Keyboard work good though
2,"If you're planning on gaming a lot, just spend the extra money on getting a mechanical keyboard. If not, then this keyboard is alright. The mouse is big, uncomfortable and was built seemingly without comfortability in mind at all.Definitely spend the money to get something better, especially if you just build a new pc, you're going to want something more high quality than this.Pros: Not loud, multiple color display options, multimedia keysCons: Not good for gaming, unnecessarily large, no key divets etc."
2,"My windows key and directional keys no longer work after 3 months. It appears it may be a driver issue, but I can't find this model on the download site. What a waste. Also, I seriously hate the mouse and never use it. Not only is it ugly, it is super sluggish."
2,"The mouse is okay. The keyboard, however, I dislike. The keys don’t register quickly enough and get stuck while gaming. Often times I have to press them multiple times to register/or release the keys I am pressing at the moment with them. Should’ve known since it says it’s not 100% anti-ghosting. But at the time I wasn’t too sure how much of an effect it would have. Going to try and order another keyboard that has that capability and is mechanical red switch instead."
2,The keys are very loud and they look dirty. I don’t know if they designed it like that or if it’s used.
2,"I had higher hopes for this laptop because the reviews were freakishly positive. It's advertised as slim, but this was waaaaaay bulkier than I suspected. The screen is made of plastic, and the mouse is stiff. I have a hard time moving it around and I have to forcefully click around. The charge on here is not as long as it claims (10 hours) either. All in all, I would go with the newer, cheaper touch screen chromebooks that have been coming out. If for whatever reason you still want this laptop, it's cheaper on the Acer website. I'm going to buy a bluetooth mouse to see if I can get this to work for me, but it's nothing too impressive honestly."
2,"this laptop is giving me nightmares. the touchpad is super sensitive to ""accidentally"" turning off. ok, fine. restart and it's back to normal if nothing else works (forgetting the inconvenience). then this morning after an update to windows 10, the touchpad isn't simply off. it isn't in settings, there are no drivers, it's just effing gone. so here i am, using a mouse i hate, because the laptop basically doesn't work as a laptop. take into consideration when thinking about purchasing this model. it's cheap, yes, but if you actually need to use on the go or in your lap, it's a bad choice."
2,Shift caps fail
2,"Horrible product. Bought it in March and it keeps disconnecting from the internet, sound is absolutely horrible. Now I have a laptop that is absolutely useless."
2,"I bought this product about a year ago and it has not lived up to any expectations, it is not a touch screen like it claims, it isn't good for gaming and just recently the hinge broke. I have never dropped the laptop but it just is poorly made. This laptop has a large screen so it is good for streaming but it is not great for anything else."
2,its a visibly appealing laptop but it is so slow and windows S is horrible
2,"I have owned 5 Acer Laptops.  I have been using Acer since my kids were in school.  This is the first ""bad"" one I have ever had..  The Ryzen is slow,, unresponsive, and just not the same quality as the others.. My wife got a I3 Gen7 last fall with a 256 Gig SSD and it walks all over this machine..  I would send it back , but I have all of my documents and pictures on it now and it is a hassle to get a computer set up how you like it.. So I will suffer with this one till it breaks.. Sadly Acers last for ever. I have run benchmark on this computer.. It ranks at 9%. That means that 91% of computers identical to this one perform better..  The more I use it the more I hate it.."
2,It sucks! Its dead after less than 4 hrs of use
2,It is lightweight but the sound quality is lacking. The screen is not as bright as expected and there is no CD drive.  Definitely not worth the price.
2,"Computer works great for what I need, but one of the hinges between the screen and laptop itself came apart after having it for 13 months. I am the only one who uses it in my home, so it wasn't mishandled. I had to tape it, or else spend the same amount to fix it as to purchase a new one. I'm gonna use the tape as long as it last, which won't be but for maybe another few months. Won't but this model again as I discovered this is a reoccurring problem with Acer laptops."
2,"I purchased this on 2020, after a couple of months use the keyboard broke down. Probably a hardware problem, because I can use a different keyboard through the USB port."
2,I got this for gaming by day 3 the touch pad stopped working. I troubleshooted it for days. Nothing worked. It only works with a mouse. I was very disappointed. I returned this item and will buy a different brand. Really sucks cause I liked it for gaming☹️
2,"When I opened the shipping box the laptop container had no protection and so it was jostling around during shipping. With 2 cores at 2.6 Ghz, this is an underpowered laptop for today's use. 4 Gig RAM is upgradeable to 8G, but that should be an indicator of what you are getting. Multiple crashes within the first few days, but perhaps my unit was damaged in shipping. Worth about $250, it is overpriced at $400. Consider ""ASUS F512DA-EB51 VivoBook 15 Thin and Light Laptop"" for less than $100 more."
2,Had the computer for a month never took off my desk. It stopped charging needed to send it in to get fix already not very happy.
2,"Camera was DOA, I did not try using the camera until a few weeks after I got the lap top. If I make like I'm closing the screen sometimes it will come on, but not well."
2,I have to stop recommending these. I got my grandpa one of these and had a friend get her mother one. Both started having troubles right from the start. These are not powerul but the price was decent. My grandpa's battery died just 2 weeks out of warranty. My friends mom's computer needed a new power cable and a month outside of that her screen started to glitch out. The quality of these seems to be lacking something fundamental. Stay away from the Aspire line.
2,"Was a decent computer until it died after 6 months. No power, won't charge, even after trying 2 different power inputs. Worked with Acer support to do all their power resets, nothing. So now have a dead laptop and have to ship (at my own cost) back to a repair center."
2,It looks as though the code on my computer has been hijacked to verify Windows. I tried to verify it via several routed but to no avail.
2,"I regret buying this laptop and spending all the extra money in shipping.I am having two major troubles with this laptop:1 - The laptop slows down and lags badly once unplugged from power. It runs fast and fine when plugged. It's so bad. I have gone to Control panel and under power settings created a different profile for high performance and gone to advanced power settings and set everything to high performance and still the issue persists.I upgraded the RAM to 16GB. Same issue. I have done countless troubleshooting as seen on different websites, my windows is updated. I have switched off most background and start-up apps and it's still same. I just don't understand why I can't have the freedom to use my laptop at high performance when unplugged. This is crazy. I'm suspecting AMD and Acer to be behind this. This issue sometimes doesn't happen but most times it does.2. Second issue is that when connected to hotspot, this device will from time to time shut off internet connection for not obvious reason.So I could be in the middle of an important zoom meeting and off she goes.Don't buy this if you want peace of mind. The back cover also is inferior plastic."
2,"PROS: Lightweight, easy to carry, looks cool. Has a number pad! It's a perfectly acceptable computer for the price.CONS:1. Chiclet keyboard with low profile keys which are difficult to remove or replace or even blow air under. Once you get any grain or spec under one of these keys it's staying there, or maybe you'll try to fix it yourself and break one of these cheap plastic retainers. I hate this keyboard.2. No indicator lights for caps lock, num lock, wifi, etc.3. No indication as to how to launch the boot menu or BIOS screen when booting up. You will have to look this up, and you will find conflicting information, and that the correct key press doesn't always do it, which makes it annoying to have no indication on screen.4. Comes with Windows S edition, which requires a microsoft account to use and remove.5. No CD/DVD drive.6. No VGA port / (does have HDMI though)7. Single combined headphone/headset jack which prompts the user through the desktop interface about which they plugged in. I would rather have two regular audio jacks than to have to interact with a dialog box every time.8. No indication on the touchpad of where left/center/right click are located. Right and center can be hard to pinpoint.If I could go back in time I would have chosen a different laptop with more features. You can do better."
2,"Two major concerns/issues: When the caplock and numlock are turned on there is no light indicating that, really a design flaw, big time!; Ethernet cable doesn't make a good connection and stay plugged in - I've tried three cables now.Also, there is no CD/DVD player - my bad."
2,piece of junkhave to click scroll bar 10 times for it to work. Options i did not want constantly pop up.
2,"Kind of upset that i spent so much money on a computer that runs slow. the picture is good, the volume is really low. i wouldn’t buy this brand."
2,"Big screen was a plus , but after some time my network connection started dropping every 5 mins. I check my internet all my other devices were working , but the laptop keeping having the same issue. After trouble shooting and other methods I kept having the same problem."
2,"The Good :- Premium Quality For The Price Tag- Upgradable , For Both RAM & HDD ( 4GB Soldered RAM )- Nice Backlit KeyboardThe Bad :- Horrible Sound Quality- Very Slow , Specially When Running Youtube Videos On Resolution Higher Than 1080P- Need Some Skills For Upgrading It"
2,"It works great, good resolution and it is fast. Unfortunately I don't see any reviews where people address the speakers. We use this primarily for zoom and other conference calls, and the speakers on this are terrible. you can barely hear anything, and we have to hook it up to A speaker or the TV if we want to hear anything. The computer itself works great, but the speakers are useless. This is frustrating as this is what it is primarily used for."
2,"Unfortunately I got a dud. The screen randomly shuts off and the entire computer has to be reset to fix it. Happens at least once a day. The mouse pad will randomly stop working and again the entire thing has to be restarted to fix it. 4 days in after using it for nothing but Microsoft word and excel and checking the news it just went to blue screen, said windows ran into a problem and shut down. I guess I got unlucky but I think these are built like dirt."
2,The key for windows was invalid cou6not authorize window. What a waste of time would not recommend.
2,This is the most frustrating computer. The computer itself is fine but the Microsoft 10 will not under any circumstances let me open or download anything google related. I did research on how to fix this and tried changing out of S mode and still nothing. So frustrating. Have no way to access my email and there’s no Microsoft number to call.
2,"Purposefully shopped for an inexpensive laptop so I shouldn't complain, BUT everything about the Acer 5 Slim screams ""cheap!"" I understand laptops are in high demand, but I am disappointed with what $400 bought me."
2,"I purchased this laptop Aug 2020 for my son who  is homeschooling  , we have used this computers handful of times. The mouse is no longer working . This is so disappointing. The window to return the laptop ended Sept 2020 ONE MONTH after purchasing it , how can that be!? But you are given a few month to return  expensive items ."
2,"After two weeks the touchpad stopped working. I tried everything recommended, namely uninstalling and installing drivers etc. Very disappointing. I will return this junk."
2,Do Not Buy! Definitely Not Worth the price. S mode is Terrible laced with issues. The only positive things I can think of are the start up speed (fast) and the backlight keyboard (neat).Downloads are pathetically slow and Microsoft Store is useless and does not work.
2,The labtop broke within 4 days of me using it and funny thing is idk how it broke I use it 2 mins befor I leave the house and I come back labtop doesn’t work most likely gonna return it
2,"Its compact, so convenient for small tasks. But, not a good choice for heavy work or coding or hosting. It gets slow at times."
2,"This laptop was at the top of my list as far as cost and processing speed, but there seem to be a lot more things to be irritated about than excited about.1. No CD-ROM/DVD-ROM. I have no idea how I missed this. I went to install my printer software and realized there is no drive to do this. I thought it was so common-place that I never even considered a laptop being sold without one. How very bizarre. This means no DVD burning capabilities, no installing a game disc, nothing. Wow. Now maybe I'm old-fashioned since many things are done digitally now, but geez. My bad on not paying attention to the product description. I always back up my photography to disc, ALWAYS. nope, can't with this laptop.2. Why do modern laptops use one single mousepad for right-click, left-click, and moving the cursor? I can't tell you how frustrating that was. I can only use this laptop with an outside USB mouse, otherwise, I would be pulling my hair out every time I touch the thing. I attempted to adjust the sensitivity but with no way of feeling a right or left click, you end up clicking somewhere in the middle half the time.3. The sound on this thing is terrible. I had to buy a USB speaker so I can even hear some stuff. Speakers on the bottom of the laptop, wow. You can cup the sound to try to hear what you are listening to. What a joke.I would rather a laptop be slightly bulkier for better features. I feel that I downgraded from my previous laptop that is at least 5 years old. My last laptop had a larger screen, a mousepad that had separate buttons for right and left click, sound I could hear, AND a DVD-ROM. Wow.Why I gave it two stars? The processing speed is ok. Still, it is no better or worse than any other new computer or laptop I have ever bought, it is just less bogged down with junk when it is new. I almost thought about returning it numerous times, but it sucks to have to delete everything and start fresh again on a new system. I also think there is a restocking fee since it isn't technically broken. Too bad because I would pay more for a system that was more functional. Since I bought the speaker and have the mouse, at least I fixed two of the issues on my own.Hell no to playing video games. I tried playing Cloudpunk on Steam and it lagged so bad I gave up. Sure, you can play games, just not higher quality ones.Lastly because I just can't stop. Why does my backspace key make a weird high-pitched sound? Weird. I do NOT recommend this product and would not buy it again.Edit: Now my ""L"" key isn't functioning properly and I have to hit it harder or twice to get it to work. This is by far the cheapest laptop I have ever owned, and I'm very disappointed with it. Saving money did NOT work out this time. I am still a student so use my laptop quite frequently. This will surely agitate and slow me down and now I'm wishing I had paid more for a better laptop. It hasn't even been a year of ownership.. BUYER BEWARE!"
2,The speaker ARE AWFUL AND JUMP it sounds buggy. The CPU is SOOOOOOOO SLOW this thing under preformed for a Ryzen 3 👎🏾
2,I bought this computer about 3 weeks and it freezes quite often. The mouse sticks and I’m not happy.
2,"You get what you pay for in this case. It’s fast, until it’s not. It also freezes up often, for about 10 seconds. Maybe I got a dud but I’m getting a little pricier brand"
2,The trackpad died
2,my acer laptop developed a battery issue 32 days after being delivered to my house and as everyone knows you can't return it after 30 days.sadly acer could only offer a repair but I can't even send it to them since that department is closed due to covid and they can't refund me since I bought it off amazon.in short im stuck with a broken computer and a stick up you know where.i would like a refund for this faulty product if possible.
2,"Bought this laptop less than a year ago.The touchpad stop working the first day of use, then, two or three week later it came back and worked for a few hours. Tried everything  recomended to fix the problem but nothing worked.Have been using my old HP cable mouse.The other serious problem with this device is the sound. It is so low it is quite difficult to hear a thing.  Had to install a sound application in in order to improve the sound somewhat or use a bluetoth speaker.And last but not unimportant, the numeric pad to the right of the keyboard  does not work either.It is quite fustrating having all these problems on a brand new pc.This was my first ACER but I think it will be the last."
2,So disappointed with this I bought it in June and still haven't been able to get on wi-fi. Due to covid just put it up because can't have anyone come do it for me . Would. Think but a comp and get right into it.
2,Touch pad stopped working. This computer israrely used.
2,"overall its an ok computer , but the speakers seems damaged, its extremely low and theres a feedback"
2,"I initially thought this computer would work okay. The camera/picture quality is not the greatest. After 4 months of having the laptop, the mouse/touchpad stopped working. I contacted Acer for support 3 times in less than 24 hours. It temporarily was fixed for 3 hours and then stopped working again. They said I would need to mail my laptop to them (with the cost being on me even though it is under warranty) and they would have it back to me in 20 days. I don't feel safe mailing my computer with all of my personal info on it to someone to have for almost 3 weeks, so I guess I have to keep it with a non working mouse/touchpad. Buyer beware. You get what you pay for."
2,"It's under $350 so I couldn't expect much and still somehow was disappointed. By the end of the 1st month it was super slow, overheating and randomly shutting down. It's clearly a bad processor. It's worse that the laptop is well sized and sturdy because that means that no money went into anything else. If they had to choose, I'd rather a crappier exterior and a laptop that won't burn my hands if I go to move it from the table. I would say if you need it for a year but this isn't likely to last me even that long."
2,the hinge on these laptops are rubbish. right one broke in six weeks
2,"Was going to use for gaming, but no space.  Games that I did manage to get run smoothly, at least."
2,"I don't care for the volume on the Acer.  Acer support can't help but Amazon will give me a reduced refund if I want it.  I will not be getting Acer in the future, but I may not return it because I hate setting up new PC's."
2,"I guess this is what I get for expecting a $349 computer to be decent.  The mousepad literally quit working.  I've searched on the acer site and various other sites and reinstalled the the trackpad drivers.  Nothing.  I had to buy a mouse to plug in to use this.  So it's not good for use when you fly or travel.  Also, you can't get access to change or remove the battery.  It's basically a disposable computer.  Starts up quickly.  Serves the general purpose."
2,"I had this laptop for a couple of days when the screen started cutting out and going black for no reason. I sent the laptop back to Acer over a week ago and have not heard back yet. Too bad, other than that it seemed like a really great laptop for the price. This time and trouble was not worth it, however, and I'll hesitate to buy from Acer again in the future."
2,Mine overheat and turned into a fire hazard. Took the hard drive and ram out so I can get it analyzed by a Forensic expert to find out what happened. Not happy at all.
2,"It's horrible for gaming..It barely runs Minecraft even with all the settings turned down. Not enough storage. the only thing I could play on it was Valorant. Cod, Fortnite, and Hyperscape are unplayable due to storage size and or it's processing speed"
2,Computer was very fast.  Had computer for about a week when it locked up.  The mousepad quit working and couldnt use it.  When I installed my husband's mouse it started working correctly.  The computer seemed to get hot very fast.  Am returning unit.  Hopefully this was a one time failure as I ordering another unit.
2,"Initially, once I set everything up, I was pretty pleased with my purchase! But after a little over a month (and having really only used it 3 or 4 times in that month), the screen went black but the back-light on the keyboard was still on. So, I figured it just needed to be charged. I left it plugged in for a few hours and then checked on it. Still, lit keys but no screen. So I changed to a different outlet and left it to charge some more. Came back to it, same thing. I tried following their support suggestion of resetting the battery using the tiny button in the back but it made no difference. I never took it out of ""S"" mode, and never even downloaded any apps or installed any programs. Basically, just checked my email a few times. Now when I plug it in, nothing lights up. The adapter on the charger doesn't have any indicator light to show that it's working, so it could be a faulty power cord.I'm going to attempt to call their customer support line and see if they can provide me any answers. But in any case, a brand new device should last longer than a month.Now my return window has closed so I'm either stuck with a $350 paperweight, or I'll have to search online and buy a new charger and hope that works..."
2,Was packed very poorly. It had a vertical line across the screen. The computer was beautiful but it is very difficult to go out to return it because of covid.
2,wont accept letters on sign in only numbers have to go trough cumbersome process to enter password requires verification through my phone Spouse has different phone so she can't sign in
2,"The Acer 5 is a fine laptop as long as you do not need to use the speakers (extreme low volume) or use WiFi sharing (The shared WiFi connection consistently suffers interruptions); Ethernet is the only viable option for sharing internet connection from the Acer 5.Not to mention, I paid for 2 day shipping and received the Acer 5 laptop 9 days later, but that is more about Amazon's lack of order fulfillment obligations.350.00 acer 5 + 13.00 shipping + 37.00 taxes and handling = 400.00 bad buy."
2,This was a gift I bought it 5 months early but when it was opened there was no power cord
2,"Very capable computer at first for web browsing, and office programs. 6 days in the charger quit working, so I went out and bought another. Shortly after that, there was a forced Windows update, and now start from sleep times are quadrupled, all programs operate very slow now (Chrome can barely run, a click doesn't register on a fully loaded page for about 10 seconds, and this is all with the same internet speeds), typing is lagging by 2-3 seconds. I'll try to system restore it to day one and see what happens."
2,"I purchased this laptop less than a year ago and I completely regret not buying a better quality laptop. This laptop freaks out at least once every day trying to load a Youtube video or a even just a webpage by turning the page black for a few seconds. It constantly can't connect to the Wifi where every other device in the household does perfectly fine. It's so frustrating to use and if I had known, I would have spent more money on a better quality laptop so please don't waste your money on this. The issue has gotten worse since I first turned it on and I don't see this laptop lasting any longer than 1-2 years until it's unusable making it a big waste of money."
2,I purchased 2 exactly same laptops for kids’ online home work. Both had same issue. Mouse disappeared and has never been found. Shipping and refund were fast without any problem. Thank you.
2,I have only had this laptop for less than a year and the screen doesn't work.it was blurry and then it went black why? So dissatisfied.
2,"Bought it for my son who's in high school as a Christmas present last year.  All was well until he put his thumb on the edge of the keyboard then closing the lid.  That was a mistake.  Now the screen looks as if it was dropped from a 2nd floor.  Cracks and lines everywhere; thus useless.  I called Acer's technical support hoping it would be covered under warranty.  Nope, he said ""since this is not a defect, warranty won't likely covered it.  But you can still send it in and pay for the repairs plus diagnostic fee.""  No thanks, I can probably get a brand new one for about the same.  I have 3 words for you Acer... Flimsy, flimsy, FLIMSY!"
2,"I purchased this laptop in December 2019 and it constantly freezes up. I typically utilize it for surfing the web and ocasionally checking emails.  After about a month of use, I noticed it would freeze up but ignored it since I did not use it very often. Now that I’m working from home basically doing the same thing, except utilizing MS Excel and MS Word more often, I noticed it would freeze up after about 45 minutes to an hour of use. I must then restart it via the power button. No other functions work.  I upgraded the RAM to 16 Gigs thinking it would improve but it did not. There is still a significant amount of HD space available (40+ Gigs) and no unknown source apps installed. This is the worst laptop I ever had. Its frustrating to constantly stop and start your work. If you enjoy constant interruptions while working, then this is the laptop for you, if not, purchase another brand. I do not recommend this product at all."
2,Windows does not run as smoothly on the Acer as it did on my Dell. My games do not work as well. Have to refresh page often when searching on internet. Not happy with this product.
2,"changed to two stars. the mouse pad button is one piece instead of a segmented right and left click option; makes it super easy to constantly right click by accident. stupid design and the touchpad also doesnt help with this.works ok, as a laptop. but Microsoft edge sucks hardcore and is the default browser. to download firefox or chrome you have to take it out of safemode (basically to make it worthwhile)"
2,"sucks....  costs 200 bucks to ""UPGRADE"""
2,The windows program comes in S mode and is impossible to get out of. This makes it useless as a gaming machine
2,Hard Drive crashed after 7 months and it was going to cost more than the computer to fix.
2,"Performance is extremely slow, which is the most disturbing factor"
2,Worked well then the mouse tracking pad stopped working. Tried 2 different fixes and still didn’t work . Wish it lasted longer than half a year
2,"Did not care for Windows 10s. And on this laptop to change to Windows 10 Home Edition was $135. Returned it and got one that said it came with Windows 10 Home, that one also came loaded with 10s but cost me nothing to switch it over"
2,"Not enough ram to do anything. I bought it as a toy to experiment with developer tools (docker), and it barely meets the minimum requirements. It also has trouble displaying videos on my multi screen set up..."
2,"I waited for a long time to buy a new computer.  I finally purchased this laptop but less than 2 months later the touchpad already stopped working.  I have talked to Acer customer service and done all the troubleshooting, even a factory reset, and still it doesn't work.  I was never able to get the touchscreen/tablet mode to work but I didn't look into it too much.  Either it's difficult to set up or it hasn't worked from the beginning.  Acer customer service wants me to send it to them to fix but I can't be without a computer for weeks.  It's a crappy position to be in."
2,Slow processed.  Movies often stop for buffering.
2,Not really the best I would recommend apple pc because when it comes to trying to switch out of s mode it’s already to late
2,"1. If you 10-key by touch, you will hate that part of the keyboard.2. If you accidentally press F1 it puts the computer to sleep, and it won't wake up. I have to do a forced shutdown to get it back. Accidentally pressing F2 shuts off your wi fi.Update March 6 2021: Lasted just over a year. The forced shutdown every time I accidentally pressed F1 or pressed F1 without pressing Fn first probably didn't help."
2,"Worked great until it one day quit working, tried everything and nothing worked. Even did a hard restart and it wont connect to internet, so quite disappointing since its not even a year old!"
2,"The Wifi keeps dropping... never had a laptop do that and I have had few in my life.It is also slow. But, regardless of my comments... the Acer company will not care... they got their money."
2,"I liked the weight, size speed and looks. However my unit would not resume from wake with lid opening or sleep button pressed, or power button pushed again. Keyboard would not respond during this period for about 30 seconds and then unit would do a restart and any open apps would be closed. Very annoying. Tried all the suggested remedies such as power option changes and bios updates. Even re-installed Windows and upgraded to the Pro version with no success to fix the  resume from wake issue. Would not recommend as unit fails simple basic requirement. What more serious flaw  may lie ahead. Returned unit for refund. Usually not this negative but this unit wasted to much of my time."
2,"This laptop is 14""!!! I'm soooo angry!"
2,"We've had 2 laptops now for a few months.  Decent laptops but if you don't want to use Microsoft Edge as your internet browser but want to use Google Chrome, forget it.  The software on the computer blocks Chrome from being downloaded onto your laptop.  I have two disappointed kids because of it."
2,"I probably got a bad one, but it was complicated to set up.  Not only the initial set-up, but the Email also.  You have to verify yourself, but you can only do it with a cell phone and I don't have one.  I sent it back to Amazon the next day.All around, the one I had was a pain to try to operate.  I don't recommend it."
2,"I'm stuck with this S mode in windows.Can't access Microsoft account because it is locked.Can't get MS verification code because I do not use smart/cell phones.Can't select USB boot from bios menu, to do fresh Windows 10 install, because there is boot device select menu.I just wasted $300 on a crippled windows notebook.If you don't have microsoft account and/or own smartphone, do not purchase this notebookI'm probably going to return this notebook for a refund.I've just bought the Acer Predator Helios 300 just 2 weeks ago and it had none of this s mode nonsense issue."
2,Nice PC but the backlighting went out after 3 weeks and Acer couldn't help me. Having a laptop without being able to see the keys is not good.
2,"I returned the laptop and it couldn't connect to my home wifi network. Acer technical support helped me, but no luck."
2,"The computer itself is great for basic use (checking email, browsing the internet, writing papers, etc). I bought it because I have a MacBook and most Department of Defense websites aren’t compatible with Mac OS. My biggest complaint is that 1 month into owning it, the charging cable doesn’t seem to work anymore and I’m terrified for the day that the battery dies and I have no way of charging it after that."
2,"I bought this laptop to use to learn how to code on the go, but the quality of the mouse pad is very, very poor and so I am going to return it. When coding, you frequently have to move the mouse to highlight specific pieces of text to do some sort of edit in your code. Unfortunately, the mousepad on this laptop is not accurate or precise, and when trying to make fine movements with the mousepad, the mouse moves in very, very small skips instead of a smooth, consistent glide. This makes it impossible to move the mouse quickly and precisely, because when trying to execute precise movements, you have to slow down and course correct several times when you get the mouse close to where you want it to go (instead of being able to quickly move the mouse to the precise location you intend). This lack of precision is very frustrating, and makes the user experience so slow that I am going to return it. I purchase laptops for at least 2 years of consistent use, and I just don't want to endure that kind of frustration every single day as I'm trying to give all of my attention towards building a technical skill. For those who appreciate speed and accuracy with the mousepad (just like with a mac laptop if you've ever used one - nothing too crazy, just very smooth and controllable motion that follows your input perfectly), I would advise you not to get this laptop, because I think you could be very frustrated with the user experience.As a final note, this laptop also had issues running Ubuntu 18.04 - whenever I closed the lid, the laptop would suspend (this is totally expected; ""suspend"" is just means ""sleep"" for linux), but whenever I reopened the lid, the laptop would not resume (turn back on) and I would have to force shut down and restart it (every single time). I could not find a solution to this issue after scouring the internet and trying a bunch of different fixes for about 4 or 5 hours. Some linux distributions have small issues with certain laptops, so for whatever reason Ubuntu 18.04 and this laptop just did not work well together. This issue was also frustrating and made for a very diminished user experience, although I may have been able to find another distribution that would have worked with this laptop. But for both of these reasons (very much mainly the first reason, the mousepad), I am returning this laptop. Don't want to deal with an issue like that for 2 years, rather just spend a little more money. Hope this is helpful."
2,This laptop is so very different from the normal programming--- its hard to figure out the different ways of saving pages etc. but once you got it U GOT IT!
2,I am never again buying a computer from Amazon. The product description is false: there is no backlit keyboard and there is no touchscreen. I didn't want to pay the re-stocking fee and I've learned a tough lesson: go to a brick and mortar store to buy technology. I've been ripped off for the last time.
2,Quality of video for zoom is horrible. Will never recommend
2,OK but don't like plastic!
2,Of course a week after the return what window closed the computer has frustratingly began shutting down my entire wifi system. I got this to attend zoom and teams calls and I end up getting kicked out at least twice on an hour long meeting because the computer shuts down the wifi.
2,Having problems with my passwords being breached and it's freezing.
2,The keyboard was white and I found it hard to see the letters
2,Do not like this Chromebook... total waste of money and time. But for the price I have it to my 12 year old. Not good
2,"I am finding I am not satisfied with this product.  Trackpad had a loud uncomfortable clicking, like there is a misalignment.Contant bluetooth issues that none of my other devices create."
2,No touchscreen and to heavy.
2,"Nice little computer, great for simple tasks. I recently became self-employed in business development. I look at a lot of webpages but don’t run any software really, and still already low on memory and from what I understand, none can be added. Waste of money I think…"
2,see headline. Keys very hard to read. Returned
2,"This computer was NOT what I expected at all.  Disappointed.The sound is awful, you can barely hear it! Not worth the purchase price and very misleading😔."
2,"Initially I thought I'd gotten one of those rare deals ... something fairly good for a lower price.  I was being optimistic.1.  Screen saver doesn't work2.  When in ""sleep"", you can't always get the computer to wake up - you have to reboot3.  Applications lock randomly - Chrome, Excel etc - initially thought it happened after the laptop had been idle for awhile - but it happens randomly at any time, even when in use.  Some or all app's become locked/unresponsive and you have to close/restart them4. This is more a personal gripe - the sound quality is very poor.  But again, it's a low end computer so it really should be expected - I just didn't expect the sound to be this bad.On the plus side -1.  It is fairly fast and boots quickly"
2,I do not like this laptop I wish I can return it.It’s so slow as soon as I set it up it was saying I had to do all this updating stuff.It’s just really slow and annoying
2,Miss information about the backlit.no backlit at all.beware
2,Very smallThere was no directionsHard to even set it up without knowing what keys did whatThe touchpad did not work or wouldn’t for meI sent it back
2,I dislike that after I did transfer date from a usb after I can not remove complete and also continue to appear fotos on my desktop. Not Good also I did take a selfie or My laptop then I can not change. Not good. Etc Etc.
2,There IS NO backlit keyboard.  False advertising.
2,This was almost a 5 star pick until the touchpad died after 2 weeks!
2,Doesn’t have enough memory. Bought it by mistake.
2,I only needed the computer for zoom.  Whenever I touched the mic I had to hit it several times to turn on mic to speak.  It was a pain so I returned the computer.  I prefer touch screen & a larger screen.
2,"I ended up returning this, I got it to replace my 4 year old laptop that died on me. When it came in the mail and I set it up, it ran so slowly! My old computer didn't even run that slowly before it died."
2,"I am giving this tablet two stars as it is inexpensive (under $200) and lightweight, other than that I would give it one star.  I should have read the description more carefully as it is not a touchscreen model.  Get your fingers to work on the touchpad if hard enough but the way this was designed if you aren't very careful you are constantly turning on the numbering feature.  It is a serious stupid design.  You have all the number above the alpha keys. Grab a calculator if you need it.  I waited too long on return it."
2,"Ordered this laptop for my husband and he was not impressed at all.  Some of the answers claimed that there was a backlighted keyboard but not so.  The computer itself seems ok, small and lightweight but unable to download apps."
2,"This is my second ASUS this year.  And it's only March.  My first one I bought earlier in the year and it was expensive compared to what it can do.  The biggest issue I have with it is that it will give me the blue screen of death constantly, and I'm a writer, so it's always messing up what I'm writing.  Then my dog dropped it once off my bed and BAM!  The screen completely shattered.  So it's no longer a laptop, as I have permanantly hooked up to my TV in my living room.  So I got this little netbooky thing for writing and kept the other for gaming (Steam games only, as I don't think it can handle more).  And I've had it a couple days and now this one is also giving me the blue screen of death.  I cannot be without a computer as a writer.  So, now, I'm going to have to wipe this one and return it, and buy another brand, because I CANNOT have it just shutting down on me like that.  Getting the blue screen of death repeatedly usually means your motherboard or hard drive is breaking.  And both of these computers are brand freaking new!  Ughhhhh.  IF it wasn't for this issue, I'd give it five stars.  And I was editing a document when it happened, so I wasn't running anything crazy, nor have I downloaded anything but Firefox.  So it's not on my end why this is happening.  Must be an ASUS thing."
2,I was a little disappointed because add for laptop quoted backlit keys and it doesn't light up
2,The laptop was decent at first but now the screen freezes and it blacks out. It’s always not responsive when multiple tabs are open and you can’t do much without getting other unnecessary apps.
2,Didn't realize it was so little. Screen is not the best quality. Its ok...
2,"You know what you get when you assume something? A modern-day tablet from a company like Samsung with a camera that doesn't even have a basic flash. I originally thought this tablet was just okay for the price but when I took it out one day to photograph potential wedding venues for our daughter and discovered it doesn't even have a flash, I quickly realized I need to slide this whole thing under the microscope and see just what else is wrong with it. So that's what I'll be doing the next few days before the return period expires. I thought Samsung was a pretty safe bet but my opinion about them has been changed.Originally purchased for offline mapping of UTV trails and it remains to be seen whether it's actually up to that task. But the omission of a simple flash for the camera has me skeptical about the entire unit."
2,"I got this to replace my Kindle Fire. Everything is better than the Fire EXCEPT -  I've had it for 6 weeks (2 weeks past the return deadline) and it's having problems charging. I plug it in and get a warning that the charger isn't connected properly. I've tried 4 different chargers and 3 different charging cables. Same warning message with all of them.Some of them don't charge at all and others take all day - that's right 24 hours to charge to 100% - for the ones that will charge the Samsung tablet at all. They all will charge my phone, Kindle Fire, my wife's phone and her Kindle Paperwhite just fine. But there is a problem charging the Samsung Tab A.Kind of Sucks. Beware of products with this short return period. I guess they know the product will be dying soon and the return policy matches."
2,Way to slow. Grossly underpowered. DO NOT BUY
2,I bought this to mirror cast in our GMC Yukon but this particular one does not have that feature. So there is no wifi mirroring which is a let down.
2,"Suddenly stopped working, I have tried all the reset ways but it will not turn on."
2,"The screen doesn't always respond to touch! Have to tap on screen several times for it to respond! Ill stick to my fire tablet, thank you very much!"
2,Tablet stopped charging after 2 months. It keeps vibrating as if it is coming on but never does. My son was so disappointed.
2,I do not like the missrepresentation of the product. Ram needs to always be over 32gig now. Internal memshould be 64-512 and 1terabyte and over for sd-card.
2,"You don't expect a tablet for a hundred bucks to be greased lightning. However, my Galaxy tablet from 2015 leaves this in the dust.This is a nightmare for anyone who has any realistic expectations. It runs like pond water and can't get out of its own way.Don't even waste your time. I returned this in record time. I opened the box and clicked Return within two hours."
2,"2GB ram is not enough for today's app.  Why not put 4GB ram in there?  While at it, also put USB-C, 2 speakers (stereo), and Amoled display in there too.  I am willing to pay $200 for it."
2,"Unfortunately I am very unhappy with this tablet and will be returning it. The resolution is not good, the tablet keeps crashing and is very slow even though I have extremely fast wifi I use with my laptop and have not had any issues there. The touch screen is also slow to respond to touch commands, which I found odd."
2,Wasn't able to get it to Google or other sites might need sim card but not for sure
2,"This is misrepresented! There is no external memory! The amount of memory advertised was a selling point for me, but it fell wayyyy short!"
2,It just stop working. I never dropped it.
2,No screen mirroring
2,"I purchased the earlier version of the Tab A in 2017 and enjoyed several good years of reliable use.  The older tablet was starting to show it's age with slower performance and shorter battery life so, I decided to upgrade to the newer model.  The newer model is a big disappointment.  The touch screen is erratic in it's response time which often requires multiple touchest/swipes to illicit a reaction.  I have yet to find a stylus that works consistently and/or with reasonable accuracy on this screen. The processor is a barely noticeable upgrade, if at all.  Overall, I am aggravated at what appears to be a downgrade in quality from the earlier version and regret my purchase.  I will not be a return customer for Samsung."
2,Significant problems WiFi connection. Frequently drops. Suggested solutions work for a short while.Do not buy
2,The main complaint is that it won't let me get my email as it is on AOL. It tries to force me to use google and microsoft and others for email. So I may have to junk this thing as I wanted it for convenience; not for a pain in the ass.
2,We bought two for our kids for their birthdays in November. After just one week my six year olds device stopped charging. Bought the children’s version and a month later that one has stopped charging too. Fine for older kids but too delicate for younger kids.
2,I bought this for my daughter back in April. At first it worked fine no issues at all. Now it won’t even charge at all. We thought maybe we needed a new charger and no that did not work either. Will not charge at all!
2,The tablet works OK by itself. But it cannot cast or connect to you TV with an HDMI to micro USB adaptor. That the reason for the two star rating. I was very disappointed with this product.
2,"Slow system, horrible camera quaility. I figured it just needed to be updated...after 3 updates. Camera quailty is still horrible. Looks grainy and not good natural lighting. Everything else was fine. Syncs well with other Samsung products."
2,"Samsung Tablet A, Model T290 sucks.  Does not have ""SMART VIEW"" for streaming to TV.  Sad that Samsung left off that feature from the T350 tablet, hoping to force one to buy higher grade tablet.  No more Samsung products for me.Young kids may like it.  But adults....ain't no way!!!"
2,Slow. Obvious frame drops when scrolling.  Im unimpressed.
2,I wanted to upgrade from the last Tab As' we had. I don't like these ones at all. I don't know why they would take away the type c charger. It takes longer to charge tbh. I bought 2 for my kids and I had to get new chargers for both of them too because they would have trouble plugging them in. Touch sensitivity does seem a little off too. I am actually very disappointed. This felt more like a downgrade
2,"If you have owned an Galaxy S2 Tab you will not like this product.  It has a several second delay when you try to do anything - yes, the screen is vibrant, and it was a very good price, but for me, it is so inferior to the S2 that I find it unusuable."
2,I’m an Apple lover and unfortunately this didn’t perform as well as my iPad. I will be gifting this one and buying a new iPad. It isn’t as fast and camera isn’t as good either.
2,"This is the worst tablet I have ever owned. It freezes all the time, and stays frozen. You have to turn off the tablet to unfreeze it, then you lose whatever it is you've  typed. It's useless to me. I've worked on cheap, no-name brands that have worked better than this. The screen shot feature is so inconvenient; I don't know what they were thinking. The home page starts in the middle. Just ""why""? A reviewer here said it was about bloatware. The charging cord is too short. The clipboard is more  mysterious than it should be. I researched tablets for 2 weeks in tech magazines before I bought this. I have never returned anything to Amazon before so I am really disgusted by the whole experience. I may never buy another Samsung product after this. There are no mid- priced 7 and 8 inch tablets. You either buy junk or shell out a ton of money for something that works. Asus had a great 8 inch tablet but iPad and Samsung hold most of the market now. iPads are just too expensive and this Samsung is just crap.Update: I was trying to send it back and it wouldn't even do a factory reset. I had to spend an hour on the phone with Samsung and she couldn't even get it to reset. Someone else had to join in and it froze 3x trying to just reset it. UPS picked it up today - good riddance to an awful product."
2,"Had this this for 6 days, and there's so many problems. It's extremely slow, some apps take days to load, while they work just fine on other devices. The charging takes forever. And the charger sucks, I already have to twist it around the tablet for it to charge. I'm disappointed. I didn't want to return this one and get something else."
2,"PRO: nice screen clarity and sizeCON: terrible touch screen (sometimes does not respond at all to touch)...  unresponsive (very, very slow to respond)... OK for reading books, but very poor for Internet, e-mail, and other use"
2,"This is a 2019 model, the SIM card is between sizes.(would not accept micro size like it says it take in description) no help for me trying to tether either, it cannot authenticate connections. I had planned on taking this mobile with me. No Dice. Can't say anything as far as online features have not had any access. P.S. took over week to receive on prime."
2,"I just purchased this tablet. So far I have a love/hate relationship with it. It's hella slow. Frustratingly slow. Slow to the point where sometimes I'm wondering if the app works on it or not. It had wifi issues earlier. Had to restart it 3 times before it started working again. It does well with playing videos on hulu or Netflix but didn't really work with Pluto. It says that I'm at 98% memory already which is weird and annoying. Especially since I haven't saved any pics or videos onto it. I am going to have to purchase a mini micro chip card I guess. Hopefully the speed gets better but I guess that's what you get for the price, although it being Samsung I'm very shocked. I've always been a Samsung person and this just killed me. SMH"
2,"Bought this to have an android tablet for use with a couple android only apps.  Need to project to a screen while using them but this tablet does not have screen mirroring.  Basically useless for the reason I bought it.I don't personally like the Android OS, there are way to many versions and very difficult to get specific device questions answered.  I am exclusively Apple normally but even so this tablet is slow and the touch screen is rather unresponsive when compares to a ""Base Grade"" iPad.If you need a cheap, dependable tablet just for simple internet, social media and entertainment I guess this one is OK, but I will likely be giving this one away."
2,Returned.....slow..I do not recommend...
2,It's too slow to change screens and not very responsive touch screens for gaming!
2,"I bought this to replace a 5 year old Galaxy Tab3 8"".  I primarily my tablet to stream video (Netflix, Amazon, Google Play, Crunchyroll), or to play downloaded video while traveling.  I expected this to be an upgrade.  But despite having more memory and faster processor than the Tab3, this tablet is somehow worse.The Bad:1. It will choke on a lot of websites and video streaming apps.  This one is very frustrating.  I'm really not asking much of it here.  I would have thought that a quad core processor would perform better than the 5 year old duo-core in the Tab3.2. The volume button is right next to the power button. So you have to feel about to ensure you are not going to turn it off when you just meant to adjust the volume.3. Having no physical navigation buttons is surprisingly frustrating.  While this doesn't bother me about my phone (an S10) it drives me nuts on this tablet.  When streaming, you now have the press the screen once for the buttons to appear and then you can hit what you want.  I guess this doesn't bother me on the phone because I don't really stream with it, so the nav buttons are always available.The Good:1. The build quality feels real nice and solid.2. The battery is theoretically longer lived than my Tab3, though I have yet to really test that out yet.I would not recommend this tablet.  Look elsewhere."
2,I have had two of these now and both led screens cracked within in a week of purchase. Not the clear glass digitizer screen but the led screens. I don't know if they are ultra thin or just poor quality glass but the durability of these units is a  let down. Both screens were cracked when in a protective cover. Love the rest of the unit but if it breaks at the drop of a hat they don't get a very high rating from me.
2,"Description did not say this was a Kids Edition, batt. life was only 40 mins. misleading"
2,"Good tablet, however nearly ALL specs listed in the description were wrong. I bought this based off of the specs stated in the description, specifically the 3GB of RAM and it's only 2GB of RAM... does not work well for my application but by the time I'd figured that out I'd already messed with it, toshe'd the box, bought cases, screen protector, etc.."
2,Graphics are terrible.  Picture is not Sharp.Slow.
2,"International model?I found 2 Samsung tab 8 models for sale, one was 160$ and this one was 169$. The 160$ one said it was an international model so I decided to spent 9$ more to get a US or Canadian model.When I received the package, the box was all in Spanish which made me feel stupid for spending 9$ extra for, I'm assuming, the same thing. Anyway 9$ isn't a big deal, just annoyed me.External Storage fail designThe 32GB filled up pretty quick with games and apps so I needed more storage.I had a previous model (not sure which model#) of Samsung and I removed the 128GB samsung EVO select SD from that one to put into this new one. When I go to install a new app it says I have insufficient space. For some reason, samsung doesn't give the option to use the SD as internal or default memory. The same thing for the previous model but there was the option to move applications from the internal storage to the SD card manually. Slightly annoying but it worked. This new samsung model removed that option. The only use for the SD card as per samsung rep. Sharon ""Sorry we donot have option, except to move media files to SD card to free up some space for device.""So it's used for photos, movies and music files basically.Everything else works as expected so far. Extremely dissatisfied with this external memory design decision by Samsung."
2,The chrome book arrived in it's own box but the outer box was not stuffed with anything. the inner box was loose in the outer box allowing for lots of movement during shipping. It may have been damaged in shipment. The touch screen didn't work and the touch pad was really loose. The manual that came with it was in 3 different languages except English. I'm not bilingual. Too bad. I think I would have enjoyed this little chrome book. I'll try an HP next time.
2,The first one I ordered had a defective touchscreen and I sent it back. The replacement worked for three days and stopped functioning.  Don't waste your money on this Lenovo Chromebook.
2,"I don’t like the fact that it’s not running Windows, and I can’t connect to my printer at all!"
2,It stopped working after 2 weeks of my daughter using for school. I trashed the boxes after buying  and the return timeframe is over. Upset because I don't know what to do at this point....
2,Keyboard stopped working after 1.5 years. Sucks!
2,"The operating system is extremely buggy, the screen and resolution are smaller and worse than you would imagine.Has crashed more than once.  I do not recommend this product."
2,"If you can barely use a computer good choice. However, if your trying to game or do anything other than android apps this thing is useless. It has a discontinued operating system for which there is very very little support. It cannot use most programs due to its mediatek operating system.do not be fooled. It is not compatible with most everything and you cannot find help for this piece of junk anywhere its a dead system"
2,I bought this Chromebook the end of December 2019 to use at meetings. I used it not more than 20 times over the year because I spent the year working from home and using my regular laptop.  In February it stopped charging and even when plugged in won't stay on for more than 60 seconds.
2,"I got 2 of these for my kids last year. Within 3 months touch screen stopped working and Amazon does not support it. You will have to call Lenovo. They suggested some centers and I had to take it for repair. I had to take both of them 3 times in this one year and now they both are out of warranty. They changed the motherboard and also the screen. I can understand if it happens to one device that it might be defective. But it happened to both. if something happens again, then I will have to trash it. $300 for one year is little expensive."
2,"Purchased July 2020...screen hinge broken by November 2020. For a 2 in 1, that doubles as a tablet ..you would think they would make the hinge the most durable part. Besides it being a Chromebook which already makes it garbage, it now has to remain in fixed position on a desk in fear that it will stop functioning. It was babied/used for child's virtual school. This age of disposable products is getting old. Of course, good luck trying to get in touch with Lenovo to complain.I will never buy a Lenovo product again or Chromebook. I will also spread the word to everyone I know of their non existent customer service."
2,Charger cord died about 2 weeks after warranty period ended. Lenovo Customer service wasn’t much help.
2,"Started out working ok... After a few months it just got slower and slower and slower, tried ""chromewash""(reset).  The performance never recovered, the only thing good that I can say about this thing is that the battery lasted a good eight hours.  But on the contrary, your going to need all that battery power if your applications are loading at a snail's pace. From out of the box the keys are very flimsy which worried me a bit and low and behold it took a dump when my keys randomly quit working for no reason, most of the keys stopped responding.  BUYER BEWARE.... it looks & runs good out of the box but... it will end up being an expensive paperweight after a short period of time.  Lenovo was supposed to be a good brand but tbh id rather go with acer at this point. At least their keyboards in the same class aren't failing like these have frequently been known for failing. Unfortunately for me I didn't research it until after it happened so I'm doing that for you right now to save you the money... Look elsewhere."
2,After 2 months my computer audio stop working and I cannot send it back because the time period to send back has already gone. I am a college student and I thought this was a cheap laptop for me to go on zoom with for my lectures but I was wrong.
2,"Poor quality - keeps powering off by itself even when fully charged, sometimes the camera doesn't work, sometimes the keyboard doesn't work."
2,I loved this product until I had it for only 3 months and the shift key stopped working.  I have googled and trouble shooted to try to fix but nothing works.  The shift key is extremely important as it is used for capital letters and punctuation.  I have to use the touchscreen keyboard and that is too frustrating.  I can't use it.
2,The motherboard is shot and will cost over $200 to fix.  In looking to see if I still had a warranty I noticed that the product was used.  I am 99% sure that I did not realize that it was used when we bought it. I don't like to buy used electronics for this reason.  My daughter bought this with her own money and is very upset now.  I feel cheated.
2,Not worth it for content creators. Lots of all apps I use can’t be downloaded
2,"I purchase this computer for my girlfriend back in Sept of 2019. Overall the computer has worked fine, but a few days ago the camera stopped working. We have been doing a lot of Zoom video chats and without a camera, well you can imagine."
2,"I bought this mostly for Stadia gaming and for media. Something that i could take with me, was not too expensive and I wouldn't be worried about breaking it. First, doesn't work for Stadia, spent an hour with tech support, turns out the Lenovo chip (not a tech person, but that is the expression I kept reading/told was the problem) not being compatible. That was a small issue, Stadia is barely off the ground and although frustrated, I wasn't surprised. What is frustrating and surprising is this chromebook doesn't do the simplest advertised things consistently. Different ""modes"" (tablet/tent [yoga?]) don't work more than once per start up. What I mean is, put it it tent mode to watch a video, every time I go back to laptop the auto rotate can't figure it out. Restart to fix. Go to tablet mode, when i go back to laptop, I have to restart to get the screen to orientate and leave tablet mode. There is a manual rotate feature (control + shift + refresh) but it's supposed to auto rotate, and once it hasn't autorotated, that command won't work anyway till the restart. Reading reviews and forums, a lot of users seem to have to regularly ""powerwash"" this chromebook because simple features inexplicably don't work. It was cheap, and expectations were low, but this thing is seriously just about useless. If you are going for an inexpensive chromebook, go cheaper if  such a thing exists out there, or go higher, this was a waste."
2,"Note the dates when bad reviews started.  The majority are 2020.  My screen has frozen and unable to use.  I bought this 5 mos. ago.  Waste.This is my 4th chromebook and so frustrating! I loved the simplicity of old ones. It is cluttered with so many icons to access areas. I don't want 3-4 different ways to access. The X in the corner is gone on certain pages, so I have to ""back out"" using litte arrow in lower left corner. I have view a bank statement but can not get rid of that after two days. It is behind everything. Wish I had never bought this computer. First time having a Lenova, but not sure if that is the problem. It's probably me, but Chromebooks are not new to me. I even tried powerwashing thinking that would bring me back to start, but many issues remain."
2,"I was hoping to write a positive review based on functionality, but can't.  The devise itself is really nice, but the useability is overly restrictive and thus not worth the buy. I bought two devises, one each for my 7 and  9 year old. The sole purpose of buying was for them to do their online school work,  coding and some gaming. The Chrome book is propriety and exclusive to Google. You are forced to set up a Google account and forced to go through all the Google propmpts. The family link feature to monitor minor is not user friendly and frustrates parents. Chrome does not allow downloads and install of common place apps that kids use and need for school which does not make it a good choice for this market. There are other functionality issues too, but I could have worked around those. Also, if you decide to delete family link and no longer use the device, you will lose the email address you had to create to use the device. I guess this is yet another ingenious way for Google to invade privacy and track consumers: create a device ; sell it cheap; and force the consumer to use it in a monopolistic way."
2,At first this was a great little workbook for my 81 year old father. Wifi didn't last a year. A week ago the wifi shut off and will not enable. Tried a few troubleshooting tricks I found online with no success. Save your money and buy an hp laptop. And now it's to late to return it.
2,I have been using this for 5 months so I can give it an accurate review. Pages freeze all the time. Pages do not format properly. Videos won't play most of the time. A real source of frustration. It is a pain to delete things from any android based app. Not user friendly. Lid begins to crack on both sides after only a few months of use.
2,I been having a problem for a while with the whole system locking up and shutting down! Very frustrating! Not happy at all!
2,I bought this Lenovo Sept 26 2019. I have totally enjoyed this chromebook. It dies on me today and I was told it could not be repaired. I am furious and so disappointed. I use it every day and now I see that I missed the return date by 1 day. I have lost all this money!
2,"This would be a 5-Star review, except that it came with the right click button not working. Amazon nor seller were willing to replace it and make it right. Very disappointed. Do not recommend on that basis.Other than the right click not working, it has been a good little laptop."
2,"I'm not tech savvy and learning the google way is a freaking nightmare.  Can't use google photos for Etsy, Ebay or anything that I know of.  Total waste of money for me."
2,"OK. I hate this Chromebook because it's so slow. I thought from all the hype that Chromebooks were supposed to be fast and not clog down like a windows pc. Boy was I wrong. Right now i'm writing this review on a 10 year old Asus netbook, because my Chromebook is running like molasses. I know it's not my internet because everything else works fine. Hell, even my $50.00 fire tablet is faster. Should have bought an Apple. To be fair. every once in a while it runs normally. but not often. P.S. I don""t have more then 5 extra apps on this, so i'ts not overloaded and I clean my browsing history often."
2,"One of the features listed about the screen on this is it being listed as ""anti-glare"".  The one I received without question has a glossy finish screen.  The product description is not correct.  The several answers to questions on this page from the Lenovo representative saying the screen is anti-glare are incorrect.If you're getting this with the idea you won't have to see reflections in the screen do not get this, or expect to need to get an actual anti-glare screen protector.Please note, I never powered this device on to try it's actual function.  For all I know it works as expected, but I won't trust any of the other specs here give how completely wrong it is about screen."
2,"Screen was quite fuzzy and text was not in any way crisp or well defined. I returned it with no problem. I am unsure if this is a general issue, applicable to all of these, or if I just received a defective one."
2,I don't like chromebooks..never buy another one. Back to laptop
2,Idk don’t like to spend money for a chrome  operation system
2,Flipping it to screen only does not work for gaming apps. Computer crashes a lot.  You get what you pay for. Should have done more research.
2,"I have this chromebook for several months.  Has not used it much since this is my back up.  I have another device.  Tried to watch some videos on Netflix.  The quality of the video is terrible.  Blurry, patchy screen.  Not sure what is going on.  I don't want to go through the trouble of return it,  but would not recommend this.  I would use it for email and such, but would not watch any video on this."
2,I have owned 2 previous chromebooks both the ACER brand. I should have stuck to ACER. This chromebook cannot play any videos that users post on FB. It just goes to a dark screen. It MAY play some of the ads. I do a lot of surveys online (mainly thru Swagbucks) and I cannot do some of their surveys that require me to rate a video or simulate in -store shopping. Already the battery is not lasting as long as it should. And the top is hard to open - especially if your hands are arthritic. Some pages do not display correctly but show up just fine on my ACERs. And of course this one was more expensive than the ACERs. SMH
2,"Videos washed out on netflix.  charging port is shot after 6 months, currently holding cord *just right* for juice to shop for new chromebook.  No more Lenovos for me."
2,Out of the box and charged this device ran SLOW. It had an annoying lag in both touch response and key strokes. A lot of apps were not compatible with the device and some just didn't run correctly once installed. Many froze and force closed themselves.I had issues with the keyboard working when flipping back and forth from tablet and could only correct it with a reboot.The screen quality was poor.I am returning this device and would not recommend.
2,"I am impressed when I got it on Thursday. Maybe it is just unfortunate for me but it  won't show nothing this morning on the screen. I full charge the unit, reset it, it keeps just powered on but nothing on the screen still. It is all black.Thought the display itself maybe defective and I am asking for a replacement.It maybe an isolated case for me, but it may also give you some idea about the quality control etc if you are considering to buy one."
2,You can’t even get the YouTube tv app. Waste of money for us .
2,"Stay away. Keyboard stopped working twice in first 3 weeks (spacebar, z,x,c,v keys). Returning.Lenovo customer service was a joke so don’t expect help there.Other than that, I guess it was adequate. Screen wasn’t easy to open though. Annoying.Had an acer R11 2-1 for over a year now with no issues. I went for the Lenovo for double the storage plus caught a great sale price on amazon.Now, I’m out a chromebook and just missed a deal of the day amazon Acer R-11 sale.EDIT: Ok...so my review was a kneejerk reaction after speaking with Lenovo tech support. I added a star to better legitimize the rating. The chromebook worked as it should when it did work. I'm just soured about the keyboard failing on me multiple times and difficulties getting through to Lenovo (which was a waste). I was within my return window so I decided to exchange through Amazon. I'll update my review once I have time with the replacement."
2,"I've been using this laptop for about 6 months. I only use it for Chrome (internet) and streaming. The camera is poor quality, it's very slow and freezes up. there is a lag when switching from tablet mode to computer mode. My bluetooth headphones seem to cause streaming to stop or become choppy. Bluetooth connection will just drop.Screen quality is not high either. Picture is not sharp.This is not my main computer, so I hardly use it and it has so many issues. I would recommend investing in something that is a little more expensive for better quality."
2,"This chromebook with light weight and fast boot up, but it will lag for about 8 second sometimes!! The screen quality is not good! The respond is slow or even not react for touch screen sometimes!!"
2,"Microsoft bills its Surface Pro 7 as a tablet that can also be a laptop.  Not so!  #1 The operating systems only allows you to use apps designed for PC.  No mobile apps--which would make this a tablet--will download, and emulating software is a no-go.  #2 That means that every app is designed to be used with a keyboard, mouse/touchpad or stylus.  The touchscreen is practically a mute point, and it isn't really that great anyway.  Once you get those external and expensive peripherals, what you have is a laptop.  That is all."
2,"Type cover would not connect to surface.  Amazon tech support couldn't help, and did not return calls like they said they would to check on problem.  Microsoft tech couldn't help, had me reinstall system said they would call back which they didn't. Still didn't work so I returned it.This was my 3rd surface so I know how they are supposed to work, never had problems with the others."
2,"I am very sad to return this product, after looking it up the surface seems to be an issue with the screen flickering on and off. I did the update on the firmware it worked for a short time but its back to going in and out mostly at startup. But today it completely freaked out for a bit and nothing but lines and glitches. So it's going back very sad"
2,"I've had my surface for about 8 months.  In that time it's been nothing but issue after issue.  It's constantly updating and every time it updates things get a little worse.  I can't keep a desktop picture, the screen just goes to black in a few days.  It will restart and suddenly go through the initial setup process all over again.  Once it even failed so hard I had to reinstall windows to fix it.  There are connectivity issues when other computers in the office are working fine.  All in all, I don't recommend buying a surface.  They seem to be problematic."
2,"The Surface gives me what I want. The pictures that were given, showed that the Surface had a USB C port but the surface that I got has a mini displayport instead. I checked and found out that Surface Pro 7 don't have mini displayports, I was sent the wrong Surface Pro."
2,The videos are out of focus and fuzzy.  Very disappointing.  Will return.
2,"Not very bright outdoors, wanted to use it for a drone monitor but went back to useing my phone!"
2,I generally love Samsung products this would make my 2nd tablet I don't like the a7. It glitches with any screensavers on there and the touchscreen is not good it gets stuck . I'm in able to take screenshots . This is after having the product for 9 months now.
2,"We had bought its 2016 equivalent in 2016 to use with our sound system and it worked very well.  We had to replace it due to battery bulging.  This newer tablet is much slower in every aspect.  Since the software is actually on the audio mixer and web based, the slowness is all this tablet.  Start up time is about 3 times as long as the older model.Taking the rating down a notch due to poor WiFi performance today.  Walked a bit further away and it lost its connection to the mixer's WiFi.  It would not re-connect even after closing the app and re-staring the table.  We never had any issues with the 2016 version of this tablet.  I had to get within inches of the mixer, like right next to the antenna, to re-connect.  After turning the tablet off, we verified that other devices had no issues connecting to the mixer.I would not buy this tablet again."
2,Not as easy to navigate as older models. Screen rotation for one.Trusted Samsung name. Regret my decision.
2,too difficult to proram
2,Purchased new. Battery wouldn't charge. Requested a replacement. Amazon sent a refurbished instead of new. Tried to set up. Screen slow to respond. The package was damaged but I don't think it was a problem. My biggest concern is that Amazon replaced a new one with refurbished. Not good!
2,I got this because I thought it would be an upgrade. I was wrong. It’s very temperamental. The screen says it’s supposed to be a little bigger than my older model that is 10 inches but this screen is smaller. It will just go black randomly when I am using it. Very frustrating.
2,"Samsung has blocked the ability to move apps to the micro SD card. There are few options to make use of expandable storage with the exception of things like photos. If you purchase the 32 GB A7, you'll be out of storage in  the short-term. This is a frustrating limitation and I will seek products from other manufacturers in the future."
2,If you are coming from a Samsung S7 or similar you'll be sorely disappointed with this screen this is a backup tablet only
2,"I replaced a 5-yr old Samung Tab A (SM-T580) with this junk. I end up using my old tablet more than this one. The battery life is horrendously bad. Don't waste your money on it. I should have returned it when I had the change to. I was lazy and now I can't, so now I have an expensive paper weight!"
2,"This generation has a better screen than its predecessor, but the much narrower frame makes it very difficult not to inadvertently change what you are looking at. In addition, the newest Chrome and Android software continually sends intrusive messages and can't be turned off.  As a device intended primarily for web browsing and program streaming this is not acceptable."
2,"Will not run some apps. Don't think this pad is authentic Samsung. Not sure, but it's pissing me off."
2,"What a disappointment. SD card slot exists, but no data or apps can be moved to or accessed from SD card. Design failure. Deceptive advertising adds insult to customers. Bloatware consumes a LOT of base GBs. Will return.However, device is slim, touchscreen is adequate & responsive, speakers quite loud, low weight. OP is slow, everything loads slowly not just the first time even entirely localized or factory - basic apps."
2,Hard to set up. Called samsung and they were not very good at solving my problen. Finally got it set up but I am lockedout of my google account now.Have now had it 5 weeks and the color in the screen is going bad (getting washed out and contrast is not very good any more).
2,"When I first received the tablet it was great! I bought it for my daughter for Christmas. After about a week I noticed a message pop up saying something like “make sure charger is properly connected”, so I did. I messed with it forever! For some reason, it was only charging via USB (our XBOX, my laptop, put alarm clock) but wouldn’t charge using an outlet block. Strange right? I thought so too! So I reached out Amazon and they walked me through how to fix it, it worked! I then realized only my boyfriends charger would work and the charger that was sent with the tablet didn’t work AT ALL!!! I went and bought a brand new charger. Fast forward another two weeks or so, the message pops up AGAIN and guess what? I can’t send the tablet back now because it’s been too long. 🙄. I really should have sent it back when I seen the FIRST message but I’m sure my other parents on here can understand how crappy it is to have to send their kids tablet back and wait for a replacement. I thought it was fixed and was really trying to do everything possible to fix it so I didn’t HAVE to send it back but that ended up screwing me in the end. It really sucks because I know that these are great tablets and that we somehow got one of the defected ones. That really does suck because my daughter takes really good care of her things 😢"
2,You have to push the side button to return to Home Screen after it had gone to sleep. It’s annoying and my 2year old cannot get to the home screen easily after it goes to sleep.
2,"While speedy, I was really dissapointed that only 2G WifI would show up in products WiFi discovery mode.  Further, the camera produced really below average pics.  Becuse of the poor camers quality I had to return the product for refund"
2,Battery management said the last charge was 21 days ago….  The keyboard plastic cover is damaged upon open the box. What a surprise…
2,First drop on carpet the screen cracked all the way across & down!
2,"What a terrible tablet, save yourself some money and get something a little more. The screen resolution and viewing angle is terrible. The entire tablet just lags. We bought it as a development tablet but it is not suitable. Even youtube lags sometimes."
2,"Nice tablet, depends what you will use it for.  My son says it lags and has trouble running video FB messamger. Dissapointed, too late to return."
2,Webcam sucks... it will put a warning on screen that junk files need deleted.. but you can't just touch it and go empty it.. you have to go searching for it and it's not easy to find!
2,"SanDisk is my ""Go To"" company for thumb drives, etc.  I gave this drive a rating of 2 because after downloading my data to it, got so hot that it burned me.  From the research I did online, I learned that the more data that is processed, the hotter these drives become.  SanDisk should have taken this under consideration and housed the drives in such a way that we, the consumers, don't get burned.  At the very least, we should be made aware of the heating problem."
2,"I paint illustrations on my iPad Pro and then need to transfer the PSD files to my Windows desktop computer for final editing. I bought this drive for ONE purpose: to move these PSD files from my iPad to my computer. (Most people use Dropbox, but I have slow internet so that isn't a great solution for me.)The first thing I noticed is that this drive gets VERY hot VERY fast. I had it plugged into my computer for less than a minute and it was incredibly hot! But that's fine, since I'm only moving one file at a time, so I just need to remember to unplug it as soon as I'm done.The first time I used it, I also noticed that it makes these weird duplicate files. After I export my PSD file onto the drive, say, ""Picture.psd"", when I open the drive on my computer there is now another file called ""._Picture.psd"". Weird.The second time I used it, the PSD file was corrupted and couldn't be opened. I formatted the drive, put the same file back on it, and it worked. But if it happens again I'm just gonna throw it in the trash. I was going to return it but I've already discarded the packaging. :(I don't know if the problem is the drive itself, or if it just doesn't play nice with Apple. Either way, I don't recommend this drive for use with iPad."
2,I like the small size and capacity of the Sandisk USB drive but thats’s is where it ends! The holes to attach it to a keychain is awkward that it is almost unusable. The main drawback is the extremely SLOW write speed!!! Too bad I found other USB drives that cost less and about 6 times faster afterwards. Save your money and look elsewhere...
2,"Nice idea; however, manufacturing is terrible. Plugs are rough, and it needed a repair first time used. Software .apk file for android kept locking up, forced to delete.The sliding of the two different USB connectors is jerky and rough...again terrible manufacturing.Not sure who they had manufacture this item, but suggest they find a better plant or at least get some better QC.This item has most likely sent me away from Sandisk for good.And since the ONLY way to remove it from the packaging requires total destruction of the packaging, that guarantees when sold it cannot be returned. Yea. on second thought....NO MORE SanDisk products for this guy.Update. Transfer speed is terrible. Compared with an older drive some files from my computer this drive was 50% slower."
2,The USB-C end doesn’t extend far enough to seat in the port but if you remove the housing it will work.
2,The lock to keep the drive from retracting when you insert it into a USB slot is lame. I would not buy this again.
2,The flash drive itself is good for storage but the slide mechanism broke on it pretty quick. I can no longer plug it into a USB A port without wedging something inside of it to stop the flash drive from sliding back into the plastic body. Very hard to plug in when the sliding mechanism breaks which also controls the lock so you can easily plug it in.
2,Portability is good however it heats up after few mins and then it becomes slow. Data doesn't get wiped off but I am not going to trust this drive. I I won't recommend it.
2,"Handy especially if you want to transfer files between mac and windows. But has encountered bugs with this one, when formatted as exfat, and plugged into a win10 PC, it shows two external storage and system says one of them is improperly formatted. I did transfer the files successfully, but seeing this warning message makes me feel confused and unsafe.As a graduate student in CS, experiencing this issue is confusing, thus gives me a feeling of insecurity, although I didn't have any issue with files on it."
2,"I’m not sure if this is only my device, but is running hot shortly after I plug it in. And it gets hotter even if it simply connected, without active usage. Nice idea, but it didn’t work for me due to overheating issues."
2,"Transfer speeds are VERY slow, takes me hours to transfer a few gigs of data onto the device. Storage capacity as advertised.Also, the little mechanism that you use to extend the usb c or A sides is flimsy, a little pressure and it pops back into the device."
2,"The drive itself is okay, the problem for me being it heats up a lot after a few seconds of usage."
2,"Works ok, but the inner detent that holds the usb-a end in place broke before 6 months. Now every time I try to plug in the type A end, it collapses back in. I have to uncomfortably hold a semi sharp piece of plastic in place with my thumb to plug it in. Very annoying. The type c side still locks fine, but time will tell."
2,"Even though this usb drive is USB3.1 - it does not write to the drive at any where near the max usb 3.1 speed.  I suspect it is the flash memory that is the bottle neck.  I experimented by copying MP3 from my computer to this drive and it starts off fast, but very quickly drops to less than 10MB/s.  It would then fluctuate between 10MB/s to even lower.  It also seems to get very hot - so I'm not confident of it's durability.  If you want to use this drive to backup files and not copy to it very often probably ok.  However if you want to use it to read/write often and if you are transferring large number of files it will be slow."
2,Gets incredibly hot. Can't seem to transfer photos to it from phone (which was entire reason for having it) because there were no instructions. Cannot use it with phone unless I remove the phone case. Virtually worthless to me.
2,"fast transfers and great feature for a MacBook pro or any strict USB type c device but the flash drive becomes really hot in only a few minutes, will this eventually lead to data loss I really cant tell."
2,"I ordered the 128GB Flash Drive, I received a 32GB Flash Drive inside the 128GB body. The flash drive literally says 128GB on the drive itself. When you format the drive to get the full 128GB, there is no option for this size amount."
2,"The product size & price is good, but man the write speeds are terrible.  It'll start out quick, but then drop off to near nothing.  Moving a couple thousand photos was going to take 18 hours!  That's embarassing.I would upload some benchmarks from Crystal Disk Mark showing the write speed coming nowhere near to the advertised numbers, but Amazon's review page has broken the ""Add a photo"" button.  So just trust me, the speed is terrible and you do not want this drive."
2,"Bought this flash drive about 9 months ago so I could transfer files between my laptop and school devices with only usb A. Worked great for the first couple months, but then the slider that allows you to swap between sizes got really loose. Unfortunate, but at this point, I could still use it.  Then it became so loose that any attempt to put the flashdrive into a usbc port would just jam the drive back into its case. Built a computer the other day and this was the only time where I was plugging and unplugging the drive into a couple of different devices rather frequently. This time, the slider broke, and I have to jam a screwdriver into the side where the external slider used to be, and its a pain to use.TLDR; Probably wouldn't buy again. Look for something with a better/more reliable mechanism."
2,It is a great idea for a flash drive having two ports but the most annoying part of it is that when ever I plug it into my computer the flash drive pushes and so you have to push the slide in order to plug it in anywhere.
2,Slide tab broke immediately which makes difficult to switch sides.
2,Does not fit my new MacBook Pro
2,"Tried to move a bunch of video files on to it from my phone. I keep getting an error message that it has been removed. I keep having to remove it and shut down the app and then insert it again. I tried a couple of different apps, still had the same problems."
2,It is a very short lasting flash drive. Mine suddenly stopped working. Great idea very bad quality
2,Be sure your items are backed up or I would suggest a CD or DVD before using this. I managed to lose over 400 pictures and some videos. Was working fine then just stopped.
2,"I knew of the slow transfer speed as many have discussed previously, but I really didn't notice it being so slow as others have described with bad experiences.  I bought this to use with my iPad Pro to transfer video files so I could edit on the new device without having to pull out my dongle and attach the SSD drive or use the macbook pro.Here are two major issues which bothers me quite a bit and I would not have purchased had I known earlier.1.  The plugs are too short.  Specifically the usb c plug is too short, so if you are using a thicker case (Zugu Muse) it will not plug in and connect.  So I have to connect it to a usb dongle, which defeats the purpose of me buying a usb drive instead of using the SSD drive for portability in the first place.  Just something to consider if you are going to use it primarily for iPad Pro and have a thicker case.2.  The drive get WAY TOO HOT in use.  Not so hot that I am concerned about it damaging anything but hot enough that it worries me enough to bring it up and write about it.  Why does a flash drive generate so much heat?  None of my sd or micro sd cards get this hot when I transfer files or play video files from them.  Why does this one generate heat?  I'll see if the heat issue remains the same or gets better over time.  Maybe there is a breakin period?"
2,"This item does have alot of space, but it doesn't let you transfer files and apps to it without the sandisk mobile app. From what I experienced, this item is difficult to use and the software you must download to use it, is extremely terrible."
2,"Great concept, but poor implementation. When an interface is extended, it doesn't lock into place very well. Therefore, on tight ports, it slips back up inside. Very difficult to use unless the port has some leeway."
2,"What a disappointment. I have been using Sandisk & Lexar CompactFlash cards, exclusively, for more than twenty years with little or no problems. I did not bother to read any reviews. So I was surprised when I opened this package to find one drive with a broken toggle switch, so I have to resort to using my nail. I can't even used the other one because the toggle switch will not hold, thus, both sides just retracts when I tried to insert it in either of the usb types.I did not measure the speed, but it was very fast enough for me to transfer large raw format photos. The build seemed flimsy and small, but that was not an issue for me.Maybe I just got a bad batch. Unfortunately, I cannot return them because I do not have the package anymore."
2,Type C was hard to input. Had to force into the port. Had replacement and it done the same thing.
2,It doesn't fit with Mac.
2,"I like this flash drive, it is simple, has a lot of storage, is fast and has the ability to connect to both USB types.The problem is, that the mechanism to push one USB type or the other is failing. I can push the connector out, but when I plug it into something, the mechanism doesn't hold, it fails and pushes the connector back in. So I have to put pressure on the mechanism to hold the connector out as I plug it in.It's not a deal breaker, but damn, it's extremely annoying."
2,"I bought this flash drive to transfer documents and do some light video and photo editing on my Ipad. It is advertised as having ""super-fast"" transfer speeds.Read carefully, it only partains to the read speed, there is no mention of the write speed, which is very deceiving. The write speed is terrible, ranging from 8 - 20 MB/s, and it doesn't sustain a stable write speed. 1 GB will take you close to a minute. 100 GB will take about 2 hours. If you are looking for speed this is not the drive for you.I like the physical size, and how it has both the usb-c and 3.1 connector, besides that I would probably just use this for small documents."
2,Keep freezing up.
2,Isn’t very sturdy and when you try to plug it in the plug doesn’t lock in place so it is just push back inside the drive instead of plugging into pc. Also there isn’t a lanyard but there is a hole for one but no way to get it through because the hole is too small.
2,"I bought this because of it having both usb 3.1, and usb c connection. After I first used and went to remove the drive I found it almost too hot to touch. I figured maybe it was because I transferred and it got hot, but the second time I used it I found it got hot again just being connected because I had not read or written any data from it. I'm a little worried that the drive will quickly fail from the constant heat it gives off."
2,"This product has holes in the side to (theoretically) attach it to a key ring. Too bad due to design it’s impossible to get a key ring through the holes. What am I supposed to do, tie this on with string? Can’t expect that to last."
2,"This is my second flash from the same model, I have 128 GB which was fine but the 256 GB is really bad! I cannot get more than 20 MB/sec. I use MacBook pro and tested it using Blackmagic Disk Speed Test, I did the test after getting suspicious while copying large files. actually there was something weird regarding this flash disk, I received it formatted in FAT 32 which is quite strange in 2019. I've tried changing the format to NTFS and ExFAT but still getting the same results. NTFS got a bit better getting the speed up to 23 MB/SecI have a many SanDisk products but I'm really Disappointed by this one."
2,"The traditional USB part is hard to use now, it can't fix it well just after 6 months, don't buy it."
2,"I should have paid more attention to the reviews critical of this product's speed and avoided this. It works, but is extremely slow."
2,I normally don't do this about products that I have purchased off of Amazon but this device... I was expecting more from scan disk it feels very cheaply made and it will not work if you have a case on your phone. I don't know about you guys but if I have to remove my case for my phone every single time I want to do a transfer it gets rather annoying.
2,"I've had this item for a little over a year. It's handy having both USB A and USB C interfaces, because it allows me to download a file on my phone and transfer it over to a computer. It's pretty compact and I can leave it in my pocket without paying it any mind. The problem is the slider mechanism is weak and it's now very difficult to actually insert the drive into a computer without it pushing the plug back into the drive. I have to push very hard on the slider to get enough friction for it to work, and when I'm not using it, it loosely slides around instead of staying retracted. I'll have to replace it, and when I do I'll probably go with something else."
2,"- False advertisement, this flash drive is not 128gb, its only 123gb, thats a big difference. - Its getting too hot within couple of minutes  of use- Write speed is not what I experected, not great."
2,"This flash memory stick has a high capacity and it is convenient, however when copying large files it performs very slow. It also doesn't have a clop to hang it to the car keys. I do not recommend this to anyone"
2,"First off, the device does work. However, it's design is less than adequate when trying to use it. I liked the idea of having both USB A and C ends on it. Too bad it becomes difficult to use very quickly.It's designed to be able to either slide out the standard USB A or USB C sides depending on your needs. The mechanism that holds either end out while trying to use it fails and it becomes rather difficult to use. The USB C side very quickly stopped being able to lock into it's usable ""out"" stage. You can still use the memory stick but it becomes much harder as you have to hold the slide tab in place while inserting into a device. The USB A side still ""locks"" into place but that ""lock"" still is not enough to hold the end out while inserting into a device. Either end gets pushed back into itself when trying to use it.I was hoping for more."
2,"The read/write speeds of this drive are comparable to generic unbranded drives and not typical of a big name like Sandisk. It's nice to have both connectors, but the its overall terrible speeds (mostly write) are garbage."
2,"What are the two holes for opposite the slide switcch?  Certainly NOT a lanyard as it is impossible to attach.  Must be heat vents for this small RAM chip gets very warm, almost to hot to hold.  Not what I expect from a sandisk product.  So I'll give it a MEH rating."
2,"Works in my Mac book Pro, no USB adapter needed."
2,"It broke (won't leave 'read only' mode) the first day, but very inconveniently after I backed up a bunch of my files on it. So now I'm stuck with something that won't erase (I'm not sending back a thumb drive with a bunch of my personal information on it) and that can't really be used anymore except to retrieve some data. (I should add too that I have tried to either make it read/write or at least erase the data on it using several different programs and three different operating systems and it will not budge...)"
2,"I have purchased many SanDisk products over the years. This is the first time I've been disappointed with SanDisk. I have to assume they only advertise the Read Speed is because the Write speed is DOG SLOW. Do NOT purchase this item if you expect to write large files or a lot of data to the flash drive quickly.  It won't happen. I'm using USB 3.0 ports and it is taking forever to save a few VirtualBox images. Such a shame to slam ScanDisk about this. Maybe I missed the Write Speed in their description. If it isn't there shame on ScanDick. I personally will never purchase another Flash Drive, Hard Drive or SSD without their posted and clearly stated Write Speed. Just my $0.02."
2,After just a few weeks of use the USB c side is no longer working. PC will not detect it rendering the drive useless to me.
2,After 9 months of use the plastic slider (for switching between usb C and usb A) broke. Now the USB C side doesn't come out and can't be connected. It also has a heating problem. It heats up really fast and becomes very hot if you are transferring large files.
2,"I received this thumb drive 5 days ago, and used it twice. The usb was getting really hot after 30 minutes of use. The whole body got hot and seemed to be dangerous of not knowing when it was going to explode. I almost got burnt trying to eject the drive. Other than the temperature issue, the drive worked fine, but if there was no temperature issue, I would likely to give it a 5 stars."
2,"Gets extremely hot, even after 1 minute of continuous writing.  Also, the speeds are very lousy and inconsistent.  Surges to about 62 MB/s for a few seconds, then lowers to about 28 MB/s.  It gets the job done but I'm very concerned that it will crap out soon."
2,"Worked fine for two months, and is no longer working now. I ejected properly each time."
2,"No way to attach to a key chain or lanyard, other than this, it seems kinda cheap and the sliding mechanism isn't robust"
2,USB-A side stopped working on my iMac after a few months of infrequent use.
2,"The USB-C side doesn't work after 5 months of normal use. Disappointed, I want to buy another USB-C flash drive, just couldn't found a proper one."
2,Small and nice design but terribly slow. Quite disappointing!!
2,"Fits the Nexus 5x Phone but only when the phone is not in it's case. That is too limiting. I would not recommend this to a person that want to use it for a phone, other than for infrequent backups or transfer of data."
2,Large Web series 4.2 or 5.0 GB movies can't receive this pendriveSoo I don't like this pendrive
2,"Realistically only gets about 20MB/s when writing which is whatever average of cheap sticks I suppose.. but the biggest problem for me is the sliding mechanism. If you have stiff USB ports you will struggle to push the memory stick in without it retracting. You have to hold down on the slider ""blob"" but it's such an odd small shape it kind of hurts your finger. Honestly would recommend you to just get a 'solid' stick and don't bother with the faff of a sliding dual one."
2,Worst Experience Form SanDisk I didn't Expect this from SanDisk
2,"I have several sandisk products and the app so it was logical to buy another.Unfortunately this feels cheap and flimsy and impractical.Another user mentions a lanyard - if there is one I didn't get it - and it has two small holes on one side to fit one which will barely take a small wire.I'd send it back if i didn't need it tonight, the other Sandisk looks more practical, unfortunately none of these dual drives seem to come with a dust proof cover, dust could easily damage the USB C connector on a phone."
2,Does not connect to my phone with the protective case I have and you need to install included software.  Not plug and play.  Needs longer connector.
2,Bad product
2,It's not 256GB it's only 232GB pendriveInformation provided is wrong
2,Waste of money since it's have less storage 114 GB out of 128 GB and copy past speed is very very slow ...don't go for it...
2,Not effective.
2,Fake given specifications
2,Transfer sepeed very slow & transfer fail many time and usb drive heat
2,USB-C is useless. Does not fit my phone (OnePlus 6) which was the main reason for the purchase.Also the slider mechanism is not very strong/reliable. USB-A retracts when trying to push into my MacBook usb port.Stick to using sperate USB drives or get an adapter.
2,Dead transfer speed
2,Worst speed ever and heats a lot
2,It doesn't support on Realme smartphones... I have Realme X2 & it is not detected on my mobile. Waste of money & you cant even return this product... There's no return policy. Dont buy if you have Realme smartphone
2,"A combined USB-C/USB-A drive, with both ends hidden within the body. A slider is used to push either end out, which can then be connected to a port. The problem is that the slider is poorly designed, and doesn't snap into place, meaning the drive pushes back into the body while being pushed into the port. The slider needs to be held in place when pushed into port, which is problematic if there is little space between ports, such as the mac of my MAC Mini. Sometimes it requires a few attempts to make the drive go into the port deep enough to function. I bought two of these, and they both have the same problem. Not insurmountable, but inconvenient."
2,Heating issue.. not recommended
2,"Out of more than 20 or 30 pendrives that I have used, this performs worst. I haven't seen a USB3 pendrive whose constant write speed is as low as 16 MBps until I purchased this (big files which give maximum possible read/write speed than small files which by default gives low speed). Initial speed may be good, but it reduces soon. Even my old USB2 pendrive has a constant write speed of 29MBps.Read speeds are ok based on its price range at around 80-90 MBps making it USB3 certified, but for general purpose where you might want to frequently add or remove some data, this is not the one that I will chose.My use case was to clone system image and then keep pendrive in archival. So low write speed is not a huge problem as I have to write only once. But generic use case may vary.Coming to build quality, its a slider pendrive. I haven't seen any pendrive upto date which is of slider form factor and is sturdy. So is this. On USB C side, there little bit of fragility due to small area. I do suspect I might have breakage if not handles with care.Generic advise: Do research on product before purchase.Seller is good. His dispatch was quick and I got pendrive delivered in 1 day. 5 stars to seller. But disappointed by product itself. Sandisk has gone down IMO"
2,Heating issue i don't know how long it will be work properly ☹️
2,"Stopped working on MacBook Air after few months, slow speed, getting very hot. NOT reliable."
2,"The lock which is used to pull the usb connector head into the body fails, it unlocks when I'm trying to connect the flash drive into the PC, as a result it's very difficult to use - I need to put my finger to the lock and push it into the opposite direction - very annoying!"
2,I bought it to use with my 16” Macbook pro but it is not compatible with it. I had to buy the converter to use it with my Mac. The purchase did not solve my purpose.
2,"This works just fine, but gets concerningly hot in use, and transfer speeds are not impressive."
2,"As other reviewers have noted, within seconds of plugging this in (via the USB-C connector) it became very hot to the touch.  No reading or writing of data was taking place: just having it plugged in to my laptop resulted in high temperatures.  It may operate fine, but I'm not prepared to take the risk of damage to my equipment."
2,Speed is low not as mentioned
2,"Compact and clever usb storage device.  Has slide out usb connectors at either end, one a full size standard usb 3 connector, other a usb c, letting me transfer files photos etc simply between devices with different connectors or access important files on either device from the storage.  Simple and effective with a good storage capacity.Edit- Although still functional after a fix, this drive failed after 8 months of intermittent use, and became unreadable on any device.  Fixed with a reformat on a PC but now relegated to storing useless junk rather than files I NEED access to.  Shame, it was my favourite 'dongle' till that point."
2,Good product but no working with Google pixel 2xl hence no use for me
2,Seems not original one...Not functioning properly all the time
2,"Received this item. Tried to connect this item to my Samsung Galaxy Mote 8 for copying the data, and the Type C connector on SanDisk Dual Drive is not even fitting properly to my mobile, due to which the drive is getting not detectable by Samsung Mobile. It looks faulty.  But USB Connector is connecting to Laptop properly."
2,Not give a good speed.
2,"Bought it in Jan 2020 ,After 6-7 months of normal operation,this pen drive is taking ages to transfer data (like 10 minutes for transferring 10mb type..just imagine)Moreover, my phone has stopped recognising this device..Was not hoping this quality from SanDisk at this price...really disappointed. I will not suggest to go for this product.Looks like I have bought one 'outside the railway station type' maal/ pendrive whatever."
2,Pendrive discription shows as 128 GB. But this pendrive shows only 114 GB. Waste of 14 GB. I am not satisfied with this product
2,Very bad
2,"I'm not buying seagate again. This drive broke completely after one fall, all files were lost. Yes, dropping it was my oops, but I've had HDs that withstanded worse."
2,"As others have already mentioned, this hard drive is extreme slow!"
2,Advertised as 4 TB but only contains 3.63. Not a deal breaker but definitely disappointed with the false advertisement.
2,"After the initial burst of high speed, this drive slows down to a crawl. Starts at 100MB/s+ for few minutes, than drops to average 6-8MB/s for the rest of the transfer, with occasional bursts to 10-30MB/s. 1.5TB of data is now estimated at 21h to complete. This is on a fresh drive out of the box. Obviously SMR drive. Absolute waste of time.If you are using it to occasionally backup few files, you'll be OK, if you are thinking about transferring large sets of data frequently, look elsewhere."
2,Had a hard figuring out how to transfer pics . (Even got help from friends .) You could not just drag and drop from your photos.. I had to drag my pics and put on my desktop and then I could drag and drop. I have to many pics to do that. That’s  a pain.:(
2,Works good until it randomly stops working out of no where. In the middle of a game(Xbox) and it just died. If you want something that’ll work for about 6 months this is it otherwise don’t waste your money.
2,"Slowest external hard drive I own.  I have several different externals, Western digital, Toshiba, and this Seagate works at a snail's pace.  Would not recommend for speed.  As far as storage capacity, I will never fill this drive simply because of the amount of time spent backing up to it."
2,"The first thing I did with this new 5T Seagate drive is copy about 2T of data from my working hard drive (I have not used this new drive for anything else). Several folders were corrupted on the new drive right after they were copied. The real pain is that it won't let me delete the bad ones. I renamed one of them so I could copy the folder again, and this time it worked. But with the extra corrupted folders there, when I compare folder properties of the two drives, they can no longer show the same # bytes, folders, and files. This is a serious flaw that makes backing up much more cumbersome because I can't quickly check to see that all files were copied. The return policy only allows returns for unused drives. Argh!"
2,"Im a long time WD person but I decided to give Seagate another shot.  Boy do I feel stupid.  Ill give them this, they nailed it with their 12 month warrantee.  I bought this in December of 2019 and it died June of 2021.  No warning, no indication of a problem, just dead as a doornail and 100% data loss.  Thankfully it didnt have anything that wasn't backed up somewhere else or could be downloaded so its not a catastrophic loss.  But its still not good.  Back to WD for me.EDIT:  After initially getting an email that said I was out of luck, Seagate followed up with a new email saying they would replace and attempt data recovery at no charge.  I am cautiously optimistic.  I will update as this goes.For now, moving this to 2 star based on customer service."
2,Starting making terrible sounds after a slight movement from its place. It still works but I don't trust any data on in without a back up. Certain files were corrupted after typical use.
2,Stopped working after weeks. I sent it back for data recovery and replacement. Still waiting.
2,Painful read/write speed
2,"There's little to expect from an external HD. It sits there, and has storage. Not much to it.What I do know is that the USB connector is loose at the enclosure. If moved at all it could lose connection and cause your transfer to fail. I lifted it up to grab a stack of papers it was sitting on, and now my 1 tb backup (which takes a long time) failed. I had to start over again. If I were working directly from the drive (as some people do) it could have caused files to be corrupted and unrecoverable. Not good.Seagate is a well established brand, and I selected this drive based on my familiarity. I'm disappointed, and I won't trust the brand as much in the future. I'll be returning it after I find a replacement and wipe the drive. Pain in the butt."
2,"This drive is stubborn to mount if it gets disconnected without ejecting. It took less than a week to be at near death, making weird uncomfortably clicky sounds. DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE. I have no idea why people are giving this drive good reviews, because it is a total waste of money. It’s slow, it’s stubborn, it’s noisy, and it’s just not worth it. Might be returning soon. (edit) After further usage of the drive, I still can't say its the best for working. Being that it is being advertised for console, made me think this drive would be fast enough. However, it is easily bottlenecked by everything, from USB hubs, to 3.0 on 2.0 ports. If you want a high performance drive, especially for work use with a laptop, find a drive that has USB C, Firewire, or Thunderbolt. Would not recommend for gaming purposes either."
2,So listen... I’m no tech wizard but as far as i’m aware this product is not compatible with my Xbox series s. I keep getting a pop up which says is cannot play optimized games which nowadays is every game! Maybe this is my bad as a buyer but still in my opinion this product should not advertise it working with an xbox.
2,The read/write speeds are dismal. It gets very hot - Do not buy.
2,"Terrible as expansion drive for Xbox. The price and capacity are awesome, but the drive fails daily, and sometimes more often. Either a game that has been installed to it won't load, or a while after you start playing it will crash. Very unstable drive."
2,"I bought it, it was delivered, I connected it and my Mac mini asked if I wanted to use it as a Time Machine destination, I said yes since that is why I bought it, it backed up twice.  It then dismounted the drive and was never able to mount it again.  Connected it to my MacBook... nothing.  Connected it to an Ubuntu 20..... nothing.  Connected it to a WinDOZE and nothing.Used different cables (x2).... nothing.  You can barely feel the drive spinning but never mounts.  I called Seagate and they are shipping me a replacement since I called 1 day after the return policy from Amazon.  Had to give them my CC or I would have to pay for the return.I have another 5TB Seagate Drive from way back and it is still operational after all this time.  This one however was not as good.  Hopefully it was the exception and not the rule."
2,No information on how to handle a problem. Minimal instructions and impossible to get any assistance from Seagate. Would not recommend.
2,Bought this used specifically for storage on PS4 disappointed to find out it didn’t work.
2,"It won't easily do what I want, backup 4 different computers. no magic with this in"
2,"Wanted to use this as my back up for my 1 terabyte on my PS4 because I'm slowly running out of space.  Unfortunately my PS4 will not accept this external because it will only recognize 1 terabyte or 8 terabyte external hard drives. So its not a total washout because I'll use it for my computer.  Sucks because it formatted the thing and all, just to say it won't accept it and I need one smaller or bigger."
2,It was my mistake to forget my password but tech-support person said that it was also malfunctioning. I wanted to remove the disc before returning it for exchange but found that I needed jewelers tools to remove the disc which contained hippa protected information. Ultimately decided that it was less trouble to purchase another hard drive (of a different brand).
2,Lack of understandable directions
2,"can store files on here but will not let me work on the files I store on this drive. Keep having issues where my files are being corrupted, I am loosing my work. If I don't save back ups I loose everything!!! I have a few of these drives for my mac, this particular drive I am using o a pc and it is giving me soooo many issues!!"
2,worked for a few months and then randomly died. won't work on any of my devices.
2,The product is completely fine but I was never let on to that I couldn't use both of my extended storage is at the same time so it was a waste of money on my end
2,It is not easy to connect to Mac laptop I am not happy with this device
2,DO NOT BUY IF YOURE GONNA USE MORE THAN HALF OF THE STORAGE AVAILABLE ON THE HARD DRIVE!!! I bought a 2tb and once it reached half full neither one of my xboxs (I have 2 different series of xbox) would not except it has an external hard drive. At first I thought it was all the UBS on both xboxs went out when in turn it was the actual hard drive. It kept connecting and disconnecting without being touched. It is not worth it unless you pay more for more memory to only use a quarter of it.
2,Bought this specifically for my ps4 but my ps4 says it does not support it.  It does however work for my laptop so I guess thats what ill be using it for.
2,I ordered this and its 200Gb shy of 2TB you probably shouldn't just round it up because i honestly was quite pissed off about that some might not think much of it but thats alot of missing storage
2,"I own many portable Seagate units of different capacities. Just now, two 5TB units, bought in mid 2019, failed... for a little while they would keep dropping offline... then now they fail completely to power up. I own many other previous models of portable Seagate drives but this is a first seen them fail completely... tried different cables, different computer and USB ports but the units are dead. I suspect the USB interface component is dead... but I can't confirm that without opening the case and extracting the drives. I suppose, 5TB quality is not as robust as previous models. Sigh!!!"
2,I've had it maybe five six months now this hard drive looses hole games every once and a while sometime you start up your Xbox and 20 games are missing you have to switch it between USB ports to get games come back then some games never show up im not happy have to re download the games again which sure takes up alotta internet when you have to re-download games all the time inwoukd suggest buying a different drive.
2,I ordered the 2tb one and it was only 1.8 tb!!! I feel low key ripped off and am very upset!
2,"My fault, that I have not contacted support.My Windows reports something is wrong, tries to run a scan and fails, done tried numerous times.It does not show up on my devices and drives.Again, my fault not detecting problem.This replaces first memory drive that was full and worked all the time."
2,"Compared to another brand of 5tb hard drive, this runs at just 40% of the speed. I bought another of the other brand and stopped using this, backups took forever!"
2,"Those hard drives were for my daughters, to use as a back-up and for them to have all our nearly 60,000 family photos and videos. I expected those hard drives to be plug & play on a Mac. NOT. I couldn't copy anything on it until I register online. During the process, Seagate FORCES users to subscribe to Adobe, which I refused to do because I already have Adobe, and certainly did not want to pay more subscriptions. There were no way to decline nor to go around. At this point I was stuck. So I erased and reformatted the hard drives with Disk Utility, and voila!!! The icon mounted on the desktop and I had no problem afterwards. The hardware is completely fine, fast and (I expect) reliable. But shame on Seagate to force people to register online and to subscribe to Adobe, and sell customers data. Because of all their shody marketing, I give them only 2 stars. I feel bad for all the tech team who created a fantastic product, just to be be completely sabotaged by the marketing team."
2,Had 20 games downloaded on it and one day it stopped working leaving me with a bunch of games to download and no storage
2,It only works on Mac. Extremely disappointed because I was to transfer the data from my mac laptop to my AlienWare.Other than that it has good capacity and speed in file upload.
2,The plug in port is lose and went work now!
2,"I bought this portable storage device on Feb 19th in order to hold files, videos, and pictures and other miscellaneous things as a backup. Initially, it worked fine even though it's write speeds were slow, but as of two days I'm not sure if it caused my computer to hang or what went wrong, but now my computer won't recognize the drive and I'm tried multiple methods. Shame when I was looking forward to using it more."
2,It died after 32 days. Very unusual for Seagate. Every usb drive I have is a Seagate. Not one problem. Tried to repair with Seagate Seatools but failed all except 1 test and unable to fix. Now I have to get ahold of Seagate.Luckily I copied data to it. Still have original files.
2,Do not buy this. I bought this for my 18 year old Grandson for his PlayStation 4 and in 5 months it started making noise and won’t TURN ON no Tech support DONT BUY THIS
2,I've bought 2 of these and they both only lasted a couple months before they stopped working. Can't access anything that was stored on them now.
2,Not a full 4TB of storage.. closer to 3.5TB. The fan stopped working due to me leaving the hard drive plugged in for too long. Now it doesn't work. The datarecovery plan it offers was also disappointing. I'd suggest just buying a 4TB Hardrive from Walmart or something. Don't order it online.
2,this stopped working after a few months and if it was plugged into my xbox then my xbox would mess up real bad
2,"HDD didnt even last a year.  Bought July 5th 2020 and started Beeping at me January 16th 2020, which apparently means that something broke on the inside.  Not worth it."
2,"I had been storing about 2TB of data on this drive for slightly more than a year.The write speed was about 60-85MB/s, which is low compared to the read speed of about 105MB/s.Lately, I wanted to use some of the data from the drive. I copied an archive file (.7z) from the drive to extract, but got a CRC error. Tried again on a different archive (.zip), and then again on another (.rar) and each of them came back with CRC errors. Non-archived data was copied off the drive just fine. Several folders were corrupt as well.After copying as much of the data as I could to a newer, larger drive, I formatted this one and ran H2testw on it to check for errors. Both the write and verify sections together took a cumulative 26 hours. Here's the verification results:Warning: Only 4763591 of 4769307 MByte tested.The media is likely to be defective.4.5 TByte OK (9754562527 sectors)621.0 MByte DATA LOST (1271841 sectors)Details:205.6 MByte overwritten (421142 sectors)3.3 MByte slightly changed (< 8 bit/sector, 6955 sectors)411.9 MByte corrupted (843744 sectors)205.5 MByte aliased memory (420942 sectors)First error at offset: 0x0000000001c83980Expected: 0xccbfc67bbfcae980Found: 0x5dd6fa74bfcae99cH2testw version 1.3Reading speed: 105 MByte/sH2testw v1.4I checked the date purchased against the warranty period and saw that the warranty expired less than a month before this issue was discovered. Said warranty would only replace the drive anyway, not recover the data. Plus, you'd need to pay for shipping the drive to Seagate in the first place.I had acquired this drive after seeing it was ""Amazon's Choice"" for 5TB external hard drives. My trust in Amazon's Choice has been undermined.Regarding my care of the drive, it was always properly ejected from the computer before disconnecting, and was never dropped, jostled, or mishandled in any way. With a low write speed and inability to serve its function of data preservation for even as short a period as slightly more than a year, I now see that Amazon's Choice is for ""discount"" products, not necessarily top quality."
2,"Won't install games on Xbox one sRight for some reason...I try to install games and the Xbox freezes up, can't play other games and the harddrive makes these beeping like noises like the disk is spinning wrong or something. I even Uninstaller all games from it that did manage to download and reset my xbox...I started downloading games to the internal and its still making that noise even when nothing is being installed to it now...very loud and annoying!! Feel like I wasted $100 bucks!!"
2,I used this for my laptop and it worked perfectly. I disconnected this drive properly every time I don’t use the laptop for the day.  I disconnected it properly and had not connected it to my laptop for just one or two weeks to take a bit of a break. After I decided to use my laptop again and connected my drive before booting up my laptop like I always do. Once I logged in I couldn’t see my games that I had stored in my drive and I had to reinstall all of them back I tried restarting my laptop but I still can’t find my games not even the drive. my laptop can’t recognize it anymore when it always does. I don’t know if I missed something or that it’s broken but I need some answers because something as expensive as this drive that only takes a few weeks to start becoming faulty that was new is ridiculous.
2,It stopped working really fast
2,"I bought this on February 16, 2020 and as of November 11, 2020 it is dead."
2,This product was not new. When I connected it to my computer I saw someone's personal files still on it. The storage is ok but I'll be returning this soon.
2,"I was very happy with this hard drive! Fast enough for me, worked well and great storage. However while uploading to it I had it sitting on an end table. I checked my progress and just barely caught the cord as I walked away. It dropped 18-24 inches, pulled free from the cord on the way down and fell. I soon realized that little fall had ended this hard drive for good. Quite a hassle and disappointment! I'm obviously at fault but sad at just how easy it was to crash this and loose all my files(thankfully backed up but a hassle to get them all together again, replace the hard drive, ECT.)."
2,it refuses to work now. i guess it gave up. unfortunate
2,Used for extra storage for Xbox. My Xbox doesn’t always read it the device. It either takes a long time or I have to jiggle the wire to make it connect. Disappointed.
2,It stopped working a month into it
2,"maybe it is me but, I am a mac user and this  hard drive need had to be configured, made some changes and was not very friendly.  I wanted something that i could just connect, click, drag and save.. ln the past i have bought hard drives for mac only so no need to do anything else. i will stick to those.  Maybe it is a very good one but I cant judge on that."
2,"This drive works ok if you just want if you use it to store data similar to a flash drive. Unfortunately, I wanted to use it for my PS4. Installation was easy, but because of a  known issue between Bluetooth and USB, my controllers shut off frequently when the drive is connected, so it's essentially useless as a expansion dive for my PS4.It may work for some people, but this is my experience."
2,Worked great for the first month.Be careful this drive is not very durable. Always make copies and more copies and be sure not to carry it around plugged in as the drive suffered a catastrophic failure on me. Lesson learned at the expense of years of data.
2,"My wife needed a portable HDD for her work, and I went with this as it was a good price for photo storage, and a convenient size.  Transfer speeds were adequate, drive has plenty of storage, but after just a couple months of extremely light use (and never wrapping the cord around it), the connection at the drive end of the cable is so loose it wont stay connected to the computer.  It has to be wiggled around and held in place.  This is extremely frustrating and makes it hard to move large batches of photos.  Unfortunately the return window is closed so I will have to seek another alternative.  Waste of money."
2,Worked well for a bit but stopped working already
2,"I got it did it’s work pretty easy to use, BUT it’s made cheaply with flimsy plastic. But here’s my story how this broke so quickly. I was playin destiny 2 and wanted to restart my computer the game was a bit laggy so then I finished restarting it which took a long time. I then start hearing beeps and some unusual noises from the hard drive I check my computer and see that there’s nothing connected. I then research that something got stuck in the hard drive and it’s common for seagate and it’s hard to fix. TL:DR don’t buy this hard drive, do some research to find the best hard drive"
2,Bought this to be used with a PS4 and it doesn’t clearly state in the sellers listing if it will or will not work so I took a gamble: and it doesn’t work.
2,Unreliable. Fine when it’s working but it constantly takes 30min to troubleshoot and get it working. I have a Mac And it just doesn’t work great.
2,"I've bought multiple seagate drives after having problems with them before, thinking..... there's no way I'll have issues with another. But this is the 3rd seagate drive to go bad on me within months of using it. I can't tell you what a headache it's been... and such a disappointment.I simply can't rely on these anymore and there's a reason why I don't get the large 5tb drives because I'd be losing that much data if they go bad."
2,I have a Seagate 1T drive like this 2T drive that has served me well but this drive and 4 others before it would not reformat to MacOS and work as it should if any at all at times. I worked with Seagate support using their step by step instructions to reformat which is the steps I always use to no avail.When plugging in the drive one time it might show up in utilities or it might not. When it did show up you might be able to drop a file to it and send it to trash but also you might not be able to remove the file at all and the next time you plugged in the drive the file may not be there. I got tired of messing with them so went back to my old Internal internal drives and my drive hub for backups. Very Disappointed I really like the one terabyte I have.
2,"I'm not sure why, but this version of the seagate back-up plus feels REALLY cheap. It has a bit of an issue where I have to manually switch something on windows so that it ""performs"" normally. Because whenever I plug it in a new machine the read and writte speeds are incredibly slow. Like if I was using a pendrive. I'm not so happy with it"
2,"After a few months, the drive isn't working. The light won't even flash on. I'll have to reach out to Seagate about it but at the moment it is nonfunctional."
2,I couldn't figure out how to use this and had to have someone else do it.  No instructions were included.
2,"While it was simple at first, don’t use it for an Xbox one. A week after buying it, It disconnects itself Atleast 3 times per hour, and even when it’s finally read by the Xbox it’ll just tell you “product not finished installing” when there is no updates. DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR XBOX ONE"
2,broke after 2 months of using. It said it disconnected from my ps4 so when i tried plugging it in again it didn’t even turn on anymore
2,Caught on seatbelt and snapped off when entering into the vehicle.Thanks for nothing....truly crap.
2,"when i first got the drive, i plugged it in hoping to back up some critical data.  the drive while hooked into a usb 3.0 slot would heat up almost immediately and begin to throttle transfer speeds down to about 0-3kb/s.  it would start off very fast, and then within a few minutes just completely drop like a lead brick.  hooking it up to usb 2.0 allowed me to transfer data without overheating and throttling transfer speeds, but made backing data up a painfully slow experience, but not as slow as the throttled speeds on usb 3.0.bottom line, look elsewhere.  i have another seagate 2tb external usb 3.0 drive that doesn't suffer from the overheating/throttling problem.  maybe it's just a defective drive, regardless i would advice to look elsewhere for a reliable external data storage and ABSOLUTELY discourage anyone from buying this drive for backing up critical data.  or at least consider redundancy as it seems this drive will probably not live long."
2,"I had this for my XBOX One but it only short-lived for a couple of days when it failed. The light is still on but my machine wouldn't recognize the device. I also tried it on my Windows 10 PC, the same failure. I'm returning this and get me a WD drive."
2,"The only problem I have with this product is the cord being very faulty. It will malfunction while it’s still plugged in to my laptop at the slightest movement. Due to this, files on it became corrupted or lost.I will have to find a replacement one."
2,"This thing is EXTREMELY slow when it comes to large download sizes on Windows 10, like modern AAA games off Steam, Origin, Battle.net, etc... the read/write speeds this thing is performing at are very sluggish and extremely inconsistent. Just allocating room for a roughly 45 gb game takes 2 hours or more at write speeds less than 1 mb. On top of that, it is very prone to corrupting files while they're being downloaded, forcing a full reinstall.This drive also has a tendency to crash, and quite often at that. Even attempting to run any CPU intensive activities alongside a large install will eventually cause a crash of whatever software is running the install, halting the download and potentially corrupting files. In my own case, downloading games while playing games on Steam eventually results in a crash of some sort, after which a full restart of my system is necessary before the drive can even be accessed and used properly again.In short, don't buy this if you plan to use it for large data transfers. Either spend more money on something more robust or pony up for an SSD."
2,"There is no tech support and the product is garbage. I initially was able to store all information on my computer on the device. second time around to use to upload it back onto my computer, the device cannot be found or read. Garbage and a waist of money so disappointed."
2,"I bought this to hold 4k movies (70gb in size) to stream to my Macbook Pro, so I don't damage my SSD by writing half of its contents over just to watch a movie. This external HDD lags, as it can't read the file fast enough, so sad. Took about 10 minutes to copy 82GB over through TB3 by the way."
2,Transfer rate is poor.
2,came broken
2,The Hard drive Works great but the cord I got was an old 2.0 not 3.0 like described so it wouldn't work on my PS4 until I tried my cord from smaller HD I have it had a 3.0 USB cord now everything works but after this headache and bad cord I'm giving it 2 stars
2,"I purchased the 5TB for storing my videos that is 1-2 hours in length.  I expected this external drive to hold more than 150 videos.  Each time I transfer a video from my tablet to the 5TB I get a "" message not enough space to tranfer the video files....... For the amount of money I spent on the dam drive I expect it to at least hold 500 videos plus... I will be calling amazon on this... I just purchased this external drive last month March 2020, here it is April 2020 and I have this freaking problem......"
2,I purchased this in September 2019 and its now March 2020 and the drive starting beeping and is not being recognized by the computer. Took it to repair and they said the drive is damaged and nothing they can do. All my data is now gone. I have work that I need to redo. Extremely disappointed by this and wish I could get my money back. A drive should last more than 6 months especially when no damage was done to it.
2,"put the drive into my system and used windows to format it. i began to load the backup i had of my old failed drive on it and began to hear the same sound my old drive made before it failed.  the sound i heard was squisk repeatedly that is why i say the drive is failing. a brand new hdd but it's failing. as i said before, my old drive no drives, both a 2.5"" and a 3.5"" made that noise before they failed. i am not getting much luck with these seagate drives. i understand that over time, drives will fail but you dont expect brand new ones to fail. bad thing is that i am not in the US anymore that would make the RMA easier. stupsee"
2,SMR is bad.
2,The hard drive worked well until it failed in August (7 1/2 months). :-(
2,"The hard drive works, but did not include any cables or screws, clips or anything. It did not even include an installation manual or anything but a little warranty paper and the HD. Product of Thailand."
2,"The plastic piece that holds the power cable on just fell off into 2 pieces. There had been no physical trauma to the machine or hard drive in general, and a cable was very gently removed at the time that the piece fell off. Can't reconnect the cable with the piece missing and now drive is unrecognizable to my machine. It's too far out of return window for Amazon, so now begins the long process of attempting a warranty return and transferring anything I can get off of the drive. Very inconvenient!"
2,"Needed a 4TB replacement drive. When installed shows up as a 2TB drive. Down loaded Seagate disk wizard, still says its a 2TB drive.  Seems to be misleading."
2,Well now i dont like hard drives because they keep breaking espessially there replacments so like i git this and a few weeks its already makeing noise like clicking and stuff and meemssing my computer i got another that is messing up i sent it twice for repair and i keep getting recertified and it breaks the one i got recently made a loud start up noise and is not quiet and dose not operate like a normal drive so now i am pissed and i want my money back i much rather get a ssf then deal with every drive breaking or unreadable and makes me erase everything on my system ti realise its the hard drive thats defective like i already spent money on returns and i keep getting cheap replacments such a waste of timee this is so very anoyong so i am afficially anoyed since i had to delete my data in 3 accurances and then it turns out its the drive it self or all of the seagate drive i own so far the old video seagate drive is lasting much longer than any of the cheap drives i am paying and getting also its makeing noise but still alive while thease others just becomes unreadable and just unusable so stupid ps this video 1tb seagate drive was pulled from a direct tv box and banged up too
2,This product is not easy to install.  Encounter initializing problems!  Unable to resolve.
2,"Drive was noisy, like an old early 90s IBM hard drive.  Failed in less than 6 months of light use.  Seagate was prompt with the warranty replacement, but I can't trust this drive so I have no use for the remanufactured drive they sent me."
2,"Plugged in the power cable and linked it to the motherboard via sata, and Ubuntu was unable to get a read on it. Checked BIOS, no read. Checked via terminal, nothing. Used gparted, again nothing. Didn't try another OS or motherboard because I only needed it for my Ubuntu setup. Ended up returning it."
2,"Worked fine for awhile, but didn’t even last a year before going out. So can’t recommend if you’re looking for something that won’t need to be replaced soon after."
2,"This is the 2nd of these drives that I've purchases because of the value when it is on sale, but they just don't last long. I've had sectors begin failing within a year. It's probably fine if you use it as a backup drive or long term storage, but using it for any kind of sustained read/write operations just isn't feasible. Maybe I just got unlucky and got two bad parts, but I wouldn't recommend this drive for daily use."
2,I bought this HDD a few months ago but it failed today. I think I got a bad unit but I lost all of my data expect for a few documents I backed up online. It's sad.
2,This had lasted for 3 months and then crashed completely. I sent it it to the manufacturer because it had a warranty. The replacement I got didn’t even last a day and it crashed. I’m not to happy with my purchase now.
2,"I built my PC during the start of COVID last year around March. I got around to replacing this Hard drive because of the fact that it's pretty much outdated and there are better sources of faster and more reliable storage. Do not go cheap on storage!! I had many problems with my PC because it led me to believe that my PC is just really bad and did not want to be boot anything and it would constantly crash multiple times a day. It was because my HDD kept getting wiped every so often and I would have to re-download yet again. It did it's job, but then again you get for what you pay for. Just spend the extra money on a m.2 ssd and it will be so much faster and reliable!"
2,You get what you pay for. Worked fine the first day and was corrupted by the next day. Doesnt even contain mounting screws.
2,"As stated in the title, I had this drive for about 1 month. It seemed to be working fine. MY computer crashed unexpectedly and I attempted to reboot it only to be greeted with the blue screen of death. After diagnosing the PC the rest of my components seemed to be working fine, so I hooked it up to a different computer and even then it blue screened.I thought maybe something had gone wrong with the Windows files on the drive, so I did a clean install and still ended up right back at the blue screen. So something must've failed internally in this drive. I tried literally everything else and the common denominator was the drive.TL:DR: Drive died after a month and I'm very disappointed."
2,Really? That's nonsense.
2,"Even internally on a SATA 6gb cable, it bottlenecks at a 50mb transfer speed and often goes nearly to 0. Nothing like the 150mbs advertised. This drive is slower than an external drive via USB. A 500gb transfer can take over 6 hours."
2,"I don't know, I got a defective one HDD but it is very noisy and makes my whole desk vibrate which makes it uncomfortable to use."
2,"This is the second Seagate Drive I've ordered. The first was the expensive SDHD that was damaged and didn't even arrive in a box.  I was hesitant to order another so I bought an inexpensive HD with good specs - Seagate BarraCuda 2TB Internal Hard Drive HDD – 3.5 Inch SATA 6Gb/s 7200 RPM 256MB. The drive came in a plain card board box while Toshiba came in original box. The drive MAY work fine at the price, but I have NO CONFIDENCE in the product. Is this  open box, why isn't it listed?"
2,"Look, there isn't much to a Hard drive. This is good....when apes don't handle your parts. The first one i got was completely fried. The delivery driver threw it into a puddle...which isn't the manufacturer's fault. But the second package after i got it replaced was missing the cables inside the small box they sent it in. So i had to then purchase sata and tranfer cables."
2,"The Drive has an error and cannot be used. But even with that, I thought it install in seconds ran with low noise. I trust Amazon and Seagate they offered Tech support but I had already downloaded the Seagate Test Tool and it failed. Amazon is sending a replacement with no hassle and this unit will be dropped off at Mailboxes, etc. A good experience with a Bad drive"
2,so it is the 16th of January 2021 I've had the 2TB hard drive for about 1 week now and its already having issues such as almost removing all my editing apps and games off of it and the read and write speeds for it is immensely slow and comparing this hard drive to my 3-year-old hard drive my 3-year-old hard drive demolishes this thing in all aspects so quick review for people that need more storage don't waste your money I know the price looks nice  but you'll regret it
2,"Was installing steam games and it started making a lot of noise, similar to the noise my FireCuda made when it failed. I think I'm going to be avoiding Seagate drives in the future."
2,"I've used many drives in the last 40 years. Back in the day, Seagates might have been okay for a time but at some point they started becoming problematic. Meanwhile WDs, although not perfect, failed only occasionally.I recently thought I'd give Seagate another shot. I bought a pair of these drives only 1.5 years ago and used them as backup drives. Pretty light use since I don't run backups that often.One has bugged out already. Maybe I'll someday learn to stick with what works."
2,We got 2 of these and installed them in my computer in November 2019. It is December 2020 and one of them has completely died.  It won't boot up at all. This is so frustrating as it contained 2T of information that I now have to retrieve from my back up drive and store somewhere else. It really seems like this should have lasted more than a year and I am really worried that the other one is going to die when it is least convenient as well.  Very disappointed with this Seagate 2T internal hard drive!
2,"For starters it’s not 7200 RPM it’s 5400. I got this drive for Christmas of  2019 and it was okay until recently. I’m writing this review because it only lasted me 9.5 months before it started failing and 10.5 months before it actually crashed. Last night it wouldn’t boot up my computer at all, thankfully I had a back up HDD (the one that came with my PC 4 years ago, it works fine still too). But be careful ordering this, it’s not advertised correctly and may die out FAST."
2,Maybe it's just bad luck or maybe the quality of Seagate products has declined recently. This disk failed after 1 year. I bought another Seagate drive earlier this year and it was DOA. Doubt I'll buy a Seagate drive to replace this one.
2,"About every 6 months or so these will crash, and some fatal error will happen, causing a boot loop. As a storage driver I'm sure they're fantastic, but an OS drive this is not."
2,"After having this drive for few months, it has started to become quite noisy. Makes weird clock-like ticking noises which is worrying me that it might fail in the future. Luckily I don't store anything too important on this drive but it would still be frustrating if it fails."
2,"The base that screws into the lamp is too short, it didn’t  make contact so the bulb didn’t turn on. A dab of solder on the base will fix it."
2,"For the life of me, this product refuses to correctly be installed in my new she'll. I have all the other components and everything is plugged in. It just does not work.It says something about ""Disk Boot Failure""."
2,{Purchased one of these drives for a home NAS array.  It failed within 2 days.  These are apparently SMR hard drives and not designed for latency sensitive storage uses such as RAID.
2,"For a HDD, its a great speedy drive with ample storage at an affordable price...but i only wish it would have lasted longer than a year.I purchased this drive to put in my PS4 to replace the OEM 500GB drive which was dirt slow a 5400rpm. It made an improvement and I was happy until it just failed a rew months ago and the PS4 would no longer boot. I popped it into my PC to either recover data or reformat it but it would not even detect the drive. Its such a shame because i lost all my saved games as well as the P.T. demo that you can no longer download from the PSN store...I had a horrible experience with this product but i may have just received a bad HDD. I ended up spending the money and buying a 2TB SSD for my PS4  after this died back in December."
2,"Ive always used seagate in all my custom pc builds, but this time after only three weeks of use it started to fail even though barely anything was installed in it. And amazon refused to replace it so now im unfortunately stuck with it as a paper weight"
2,It's not necessarily a bad hard drive. Mine broke after a couple of months. I had troubles with it from the beginning where all my files saved to  my hard  drive were corrupted almost every day and I would have to go manually fix them. Maybe I got a faulty drive I don't know. Wouldn't recommend it though.
2,"This is SMR drive - it becomes very slow (about 10MB/s slow) when writing more than a few hundred GBs to the drive at a time. The drive is noisy long time after the writes completed.This ""feature"" is not published in the product listing or drive specification by Seagate. Though it is probably mentioned in the upset reviews somewhere. I checked the product description, but I did not expect normal desktop drive to be SMR.@Amazon - please label SMR drives as such in the product listing. The disk manufactures are actively trying to hide it.I intended to use this drive as ""low cost"" backup drive - not expecting/needing more than about 100MB/s sequential write speeds. This drive underwhelms my wildest imaginations of what it means to be slow drive.It take at least 5:30 hours to write 1TB to the drive. Since the drive is getting progressively slower, I estimate it will take about 2-3 days to write initial 5TBs! Sequential read speeds are OK.I cannot recommend this drive to anyone who intends to write more than about 100-200GB at at time to the drive - then wait a while before writing more. This is clearly industry in decline - hard drives are becoming slower and more expensive over time - with all sorts of tricks to deceive/not-tell customers."
2,Every five seconds a very audible and squeaky “Ka-chunk” can be heard. It’s like water torture but for your ears. Started a week after return window closed. Never buying Seagate again. Will use these in a raid server I’m building and expect failure within a year
2,The box the hard drive came in was opened.
2,"Sad I have to say this, since the Seagate drive on my old computer was always very reliable, never had any issues with it. On my new custom-built computer, though, quite a pain.The installation was incredibly easy, just slid it into the slot, screwed it into place, and connected the cables; very easy. It was very quiet and ample storage for me for about 2-3 weeks, but then it started making a clicking sound out of nowhere; seriously, out of nowhere. I had been downloading old video files to the drive for about an hour, and the clicking started then and continued for about 2-3 days before going away. A week later, while changing the voltage on my computer, the drive completely failed.I've tried 3 data recovery tools, every possible way to re-initialize or recognize the drive on my computer (data-destructive or otherwise), and had no success. I've done hardly any physical movement to the computer, and the only culprit I could think of that would possibly have caused the hard drive to fail is high temperatures, which hasn't affected any of my other computer parts negatively. Very unfortunate situation."
2,"From the very beginning, I was disappointed by the noise - all the time!Now, after several days the computer seems to be running slow - I often get (not responding) in my web browsers and even in my file manager, which happened very rarely on this computer.A recent Windows 10 Feature Update took around 9 hours when it took less than 2 hours in other computers.This may or may not be due to the HDD, but as of now it's the #1 suspect."
2,"The hdd doesn’t work, can’t be detected & it doesn’t spin. It’s completely dead."
2,It is good storage wise but it always produced coil whine and later just stopped being detected by my PC.
2,"Does not come with SATA cable , not able to connect out the box. Dissapointed. Will give a more detailed review once a purchase a cable to connect hard drive to monitor."
2,"The hard drive itself is great, no issues, but it’s insanely annoying to now have to order superset cables with it. Literally nobody would mine paying more to get cables with it. Lazy on sellers part."
2,Didn't disclose that this 8 TB HDD used SMR technology instead of CMR. Write speeds are terrible and is not well suited for every day use.
2,"The hard-drive I received is insanely slow. The write speed is so bad it takes hours to download a game. Downloads constantly freeze so the hard-drive write can catch up. I try installing to my SSD or other HDD and things work fine. Either this drive is slow or I got a bad seed. Either way im not happy with it. Just going to use it for file storage, too big of a hassle to take it out and wipe its data to return it."
2,It does show up in the bios anymore meaning its no good anymore changed cables as well and still nothing. Not saying its a bad product its just one of those things about electronics sometimes they just stop working
2,"This drive seems fine in every way but for the fact that I believe it's the noisiest hard drive I've ever owned.  While it's idle, it's fine, but when it's reading or writing, the noise is excessive.  Very distracting!"
2,"Did not come with mounting screws. Seller would not send any. I would have to exchange for a new one. So I had to order some myself. Smallest order was 200 screws for 6$. Not the money, but the inconvenience."
2,"I have been a happy Seagate customer for over a decade, but this drive has made me put that on pause for a bit. The ST2000DM008 uses SMR, or Shingled Magnetic Recording, and other drives in the non-pro Barracuda line appear to now as well. If you are installing this in a workstation with low performance demands from storage, then this is a non-issue. SMR is cheaper in most cases, and typically delivers comparable reliability to CMR (Conventional Magnetic Recording).However if you plan to install this on a higher storage performance demand workstation, or use this in any sort of RAID environment, you will be fighting ""random"" slowdowns in I/O that may even be seen as failures by your RAID controller. This is due to the specifics to SMR technology, not because of any design flaw on Seagate's part.If Seagate had been transparent about their use of SMR in this drive, then this would be a 5 star drive for its use case. Unfortunately they made this information almost impossible for customers to find out ahead of time without specific internet searches, so as a result I am giving this drive a 2 star rating.Bottom line: reliable, quiet, low heat drive with inherently slow performance due to undeclared cost saving measures. Great for cold storage or mid to low performance workstations, unacceptable for use anywhere else."
2,Using this Hard Drive as your main storage device has been a complete headache so far. I should have just went with an SSD. Surprisingly it worked OK for about 2 Weeks as supporting my OS before out of nowhere the disk usage shot up to 100% usage 24/7. At first I had thought something went wrong but then I remembered that there is a reason this is so affordable. It's obviously not geared to support Windows 10 plus heavy tasks. The response time and data rates are just abysmal. I just find it ridiculous that people say that SSDs are so affordable when really they are 3x - 4x more expensive than this just to get an equal amount of storage. Being new to PC building this is something I did not expect. For anyone who is thinking of doing the same prepare to have your fair share of challenges or be prepared to just fork out a ton of money for something that will finally work as you'd expect it to. These HDDs are only good if you use them as secondary devices. Otherwise the performance will just have you wanting to smash it into pieces over how terrible it actually is. Now I'm left with a extremely slow PC and can't perform any real tasks now since my new PC is a stuttery mess because of this. Now I have to purchase a decent boot drive that will end up being more than 3x - 4x more expensive. Reality is often disappointing.
2,It doesn't fit my MacBook Air very well and is constantly popping off. The case also doesn't allow me to open the screen very far.
2,It broke after 2 weeks and cut my hand...
2,Avoid this product. Your fingerprints get all over the case and very difficult to wipe off.
2,Color not as advertised.  Wanted a green but got some puke color instead.  Not very glossy either.
2,Very hard to install on my m1 macbook air. Too small and in the three months it has broken in many places. It came with an opened keyboard cover and screen protector. the keyboard cover cannot be wiped with a clorox wipe or it will not be sticky anymore.
2,This product does not show the apple logo through it as shown in the photo. This was disappointing.
2,"Very misleading, and very disappointing. The case was not compatible with my new M1 MacBook Air. The case was not quite thick enough."
2,Corners of this case broke after 1 year
2,The case cracked when I put it on the first time ☹️
2,Doesn’t all fit. Only parts of it
2,"The photo shows Apple logo through the case but it is not sheer.  The top snapped on fine, but the bottom didn't seem to fit perfectly...just a little off.  Then I saw that one of the ports on the side was slightly covered by the case cover so i couldn't use that as a plug in.  Clearly, misleading as it says it fits 2020 Macbooks."
2,"I have had my case since January 11th, and have been very disappointed with the case so far. I have never dropped my laptop and am not rough with it at all. On three out of the four corners, I have had cracking. On one of the corners, there have been parts that have broken off. I would not recommend this case to anyone looking to protect their laptop."
2,"I had to press SO HARD on my laptop for this thing to clip on I thought I would damage it.  Worst of all, I couldn’t open the laptop past 90 degrees. That’s just sad. Ended up buying from Incase."
2,It does not fit the MacBook air 20. The case at the bottom doesn’t fit because it’s too small.
2,"If you’re looking for a cover that is immediately covered in fingerprints that you can’t get off, this is what you want. It looks terrible!!!"
2,"I'm not sure if I'm the only one with this issue, but the quality of the case seems very poor. I have not dropped my laptop, in fact, I don't even take it out of the house; however, the corners have cracked and broke. If the corners keep cracking the case won't be able to hold anymore."
2,Does not fit Mac book air 2020 version
2,"Hard to install, did not fit properly. Scratched up within a few days of use and cracked on every corner within a couple months transporting to and from work. Not very durable. Case would also not always stay on tightly and come off."
2,"Disappointed, doesn’t fit exactly for my MacBook Air the bottom on one side. It cracked the top one within two months."
2,"I really loved the color selection. I purchased the wine option twice because these break too quickly. The worst part is I never take my laptop outside of my home. It's not like the case is undergoing too much movement, it's just really cheap material. I would prefer some sort of soft silicone covering for my MacBook."
2,"The quality of the actual cover is very poor. It is cheap plastic. It leaves marks and scratches from almost nothing. I wanted to like it but I have to be looking for something else, unfortunately."
2,It broke off too quickly on the edges.
2,"I really liked my case at first, as it was easy to install, came with a keyboard cover, and was a nice color and texture. It immediately attracts fingerprints, but since I cover mine with stickers that wasn't a huge deal to me (be warned that you can see fingerprints just from grabbing it).I have only had my case for about 4 months, and already my 4 corners have broken off. I am really careful with my laptop -- in fact, during the pandemic, it's only ever been between my couch, my bed, and my desk! I've probably dropped my laptop twice from about 2 feet off the ground. I have never had a case break so easily and so quickly, and it's especially shocking given that I had another case last for 4 years when I was traveling and doing everything with my laptop, and this one is breaking within 4 months of a 20-foot radius.  I'm about to order a new case that hopefully doesn't attract so many fingerprints and doesn't break from literally sitting in my lap."
2,"Was excited to get this because the color matched my iPhone case’s color. However, this case is not compatible with MacBook Air 2020. The bottom is a little off so doesn’t fit all the way. Neither is it as shown. You can not see the apple symbol through the case so it’s not sheer like you see in this ad. It’s a solid color.I would return it if I hadn’t already used the screen protector it came with. Idk was just disappointed."
2,"Did not fit the lower portion of my new 2020 Macbook Air, despite stating it would."
2,Ordered the wrong laptop cover. Did not read correctly. It was easy to put on but didn’t fit my laptop so that was a waste!
2,they don’t fit well except the keyboard protector but that’s it
2,I like the product but rated it low because I really can't use it due to not being able to plug the power cord in while the bottom part is on.
2,"First, the top cover doesn't even fit properly. I didn't want to break, crack, or ruin my laptop trying to push it on. I tried numerous times trying to fit the top cover alone. Secondly, the bottom cover fits BUT you can only adjust the screen ever so slightly past 90 degrees, wth. Third, they offer you two keyboard covers which is nice, with a cut out for the fingerprint button. Here comes the but... BUT it literally falls right off. I haven't tried the screen protector bc I already have my own... It seems like the only thing I don't have an issue with is the little carrying case.I've opened this, but will be returning. This is the one time I should have believed the terrible reviews, versus the amount of star ratings. TRASH, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!"
2,"Good fit for MacBook Air, but every little fingerprint can be seen. I washed the case with soap and water and the smudges would not go away, so I returned the product. I would NOT RECOMMEND the frost color - maybe go with a different color."
2,"I have the A-2179 model, which was stated as compatible in the review. Buyer beware. I'd find something else. I've definitely seen higher quality products than this for the a similar price. Cheapest keyboard dust cover ever... It's not even silicone. It's like a cheap plastic. Case was way heavier and bulkier than anticipated and worried it might damage my Mac in the long run. Had imperfections and didn't really fit right. Macbook won't open past 90 degrees in the case. Regret this purchase. Will likely try and return."
2,"The case fits the top perfectly, however, the bottom does not fit well at all. Very disappointed."
2,Bad fit on my M1 macbook air
2,I love the color. I have the 2020 MacBook Air with the M1 chip so there’s no ventilation on the bottom. The top piece fit perfectly but the bottom piece does not fit for some reason. One of the back corners does not fit for some reason and it’s kinda a shame. I tried to contact the company but I never received a response.
2,the case broke right away I tried to install
2,"This product is horrible for the Late 2020 MacBook Air M1 and Macbook Pro M1. The bottom part won't fit properly and blocks one of the thunderbolt ports. Also, if you touch it, it displays ugly fingerprints. And I mean, REAL ugly ones.Also, the keyboard cover that comes along with this is useless for the MacBook Pro M1 since it has a touchbar and there is no opening for the touchbar on the keyboard case.I just got a new MBP 13"" three days ago from the Apple Store and ordering their cover ruined the true asthetic of my new computer. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone who's thinking to purchase it for their M1 machines. Better go with Dbrand skins."
2,"Although this case does its minimum job in protecting my computer, the corners cracked and broke within less than a month. Would not recommend."
2,"Liked the color (I ordered orange) but unfortunately that was the only positive feature of this product. It was not easy to install. Bottom cover didn’t fit (I have 2020 MacBook Air A2337), the lip wouldn’t snap on, like MacBook was too thick. Got the top cover on but later that day noticed tiny crack on one of the corners. Also matte finish is showing every fingerprint, so after handling MacBook for half an hour cover looked very sloppy. Was really looking forward to liking it but had no choice but to return this product"
2,Easy to install. However the durability not so good!  Only lasted about 4 months.  The bottom case cracked.
2,"My daughter bought this to protect her new Apple Mac Air. Unfortunately, she stopped using the bottom part. Because it wouldn't fit properly. It kept falling off. So the bottom half of the case is too small to fit her new Apple Mac Air that she received for Christmas."
2,Ugly
2,It broke within 3 weeks. Low quality
2,"The matte white/frost version of this shows fingerprints HORRIBLY!  I fits my new M1 MacBook Air perfectly, but make the computer look ugly due to the fingerprints that show up everywhere."
2,I’ve had this for one month and haven’t left my house and pieces are already cracking off.  Not happy :(
2,"My review is based on the fact that I own a Macbook 13.3 (2018). Upon opening the box, I was a little disappointed. I was expecting a gel like material, even though the description clearly states plastic. It fits. But what I did not like is the following, the bottom cover, has is only one opening for USB. Clearly whomever designed this does not own an Apple. The MacBook has on both sides access's to USBs. Anyway, I am too lazy to return. At least I am not scratching it."
2,It hard putting on and staying that way and no I wouldn't recommend
2,"I cannot fit it properly on my laptop, one of the worst purchases of 2020"
2,"I've ordered this product before a couple years ago and was so impressed. the keyboard cover came with strips already attached so that it would stick to the keyboard and it lasted a couple years. after the actual hard case broke for my laptop I decided to order it again as I loved it last time. it just arrived in the mail and since I was getting the exact same cause from a couple years ago I took my case and keyboard cover off. I noticed that there were two keyboard cases and started to apply those little stickers that don't actually fit the apple keyboard because they are too thick. I then realized I had applied the wrong one because of my up and down arrow keys. however, they make you put the sticky part on it yourself and they don't even fit. I will be returning because I am so unimpressed with how the quality went down with this product. I'll just keep my broken case and look for a sticky keyboard somewhere else. if you've purchased it before you will be disappointed. do not recommend!!"
2,"Description is incorrect, it doesn't include the A2337 Model. The top part of my case didn't fit."
2,"I bought this for my new laptop.The bottom section does not fit securely, a constant readjustment before or after. If using some USB hub the bottom piece must be removed. Planning on another laptop purchase and will not buy this product again."
2,The small clip areas that hold the plastic to the laptop are easily broken off and it now doesn't work at all.
2,I disliked it bc it feels cheap and it does not show my apple label. This is the reason I chose to go with this product. The item to place on the keyboard will not stay in place and does not cover all the keys correctly. I am going to return the product and get another one.
2,"Did not fit my 2020 MacBook Air. It is a very flimsy case, you get what you pay for I guess. Had to go and just buy an Apple one."
2,"Absolutely does not fit a 2020 Air. Wish I had heeded the warnings. The ones that it did work on, I am happy for you. This was a waste of money and with my aversion to going to stores, not worth taking to get the refund. Glad it was only $16. Can not recommend for a 2020 Air at all"
2,the product isn't bad but it doesn't fit well for the MacBook it doesn't click on and i had a crack on my case when I got it
2,This was not made for the 2020 MacBook despite it being advertised as such. It’s much too small. I could not get it on at all. It would only fit one side because it’s not thick enough. The color is duller than expected from the picture. I would say it’s more of an army green than a peacock green. I can also see fresh glue on one of the rubber stands on the bottom which makes it look wet. Very disappointed. Will return.
2,I would not recommend this product.  This cover is very hard to snap on and while struggling with this several fingerprints were left. When I tried to clean the cover it cracked. So now I have a rack in the cover and several fingerprints. This product is poor quality and I would not purchase it if I were you.
2,"Unfortunately, fingerprints easily made it look terrible. Would not use this in front of a client. Going to return."
2,"I’m not very impressed with this product.  It never quite installed as it should have, it doesn’t feel great, it doesn’t show the Apple logo (as is shown in the picture) and it pulls leg hair if you have any.  I just was not a fan."
2,It didn’t fit very well and so we don’t use it.
2,Doesn’t fit my Mac. I couldn’t get it on. Horrible. Shouldn’t be this hard to install.
2,I got a case that wasn’t transparent where the Apple lights up and the keyboard cover doesnt fit the arrow keys
2,It’s hard to put on
2,The back corner on the left side of the case started to crack within a few months of use. Eventually the cracks became so bad that the corner of the case fell off.  I am very careful with my MacBook Pro.  I never bumped this corner on anything.  I have no idea why the case would crack like this except for poor quality.  I have ordered another brand of case.
2,I wish I read the reviews before I purchased this. The bottom half of the case doesn't fit perfectly. It clicks onto my MacBook in three spots but not the fourth. Pieces of the cases have already cracked off in the corners and I've only had this for two months. I use this MacBook for work so it doesn't leave my desk since I work from home. Gave two stars for the color and the fact that it includes two keyboard covers and a screen protector. Disappointed.
2,The cover it’s self is worth it but the keyboard plastic and the plastic cover for screen suck
2,This case is durable but it looks terrible. it shows every fingerprint and it's difficult to clean them off.
2,"Came with a lot of extra garbage, no directions, and the keyboard protector was really disappointing"
2,I have ordered this cover about 4 times and each one arrived with multiple scratches and/or chip marks. So disappointing..
2,I thought these cover let you see the Apple logo but this cover doesn’t. Also the bottom cover doesn’t fit properly and covers up one of the connectors.
2,I was really disappointed with this case. It doesn't protect at all. My case literally scratched up on like the second day of having it for no reason. I got the clear case. Also it cracked from a corner when trying to remove it. Do not recommend this product was super disappointed.
2,The case does not completely fit properly. Whenever you fully open the mac book the bottom case part pops off.
2,"I have used these cases in the past for my older versions of MacBook and were fine. They probably broke around a year into having it. However, these cases for the new MacBook Air don't seem very durable. They don't seem to snap onto the computer as the other ones did. I ordered two of these cases. One for me and one for my sister, and my sister's case came cracked and mine came opened. I need a replacement for my sister's case. If I can exchange them then I'll change my rating. I do not want to spend $20 on a case that won't last."
2,This is not very durable. The plastic corners are very cheap and broke the first week we got it. Wasn't dropped or anything harsh. It just broke.
2,Corner broke with in one month.
2,"lots of fingerprints on the top, the back doesnt fit perfectly, there's one side that doesnt clip at all ... nice color, but doesnt fit ."
2,"Sadly I did not read the comments before buying. I can confirm it is not meant for the newer 2020 model, which is slightly thicker. Incredible frustrating that they don’t take it out of the title. It’s false advertising."
2,"Bottom case never really fit, then the top case corners started cracking/chipping off. This is strange because I never dropped my laptop nor bumped it in any way."
2,"This case fit my laptop, but it blocks one of the two ports on the lefthand side. I didn't realize this before ordering or else I would have gotten something different. I'm sad because I just wasted my money.. If you have the new MacBook Pro, don't get this case."
2,I’ve only had it a couple of weeks and functionally it does it’s job. It just smears and looks terrible with a minimum of handling.
2,It worked for awhile but the bottom broke and won’t stay on. Also shows fingerprints a lot. Poor quality product.
2,"what i disliked ab this product was it didn’t fit my mac like it said it would my computer can’t do more than 90 degrees, and the bottom part of the case doesnt snap in. it doesn’t protect it at all"
2,"I purchased the clear case for my 2020 MacBook Air. The case arrived with a few smudges that a little cleaning with the included fabric did not remove. But a much bigger problem was that the case does not fit properly. The case has small slots that are supposed to snap onto the base of the computer, but only two of the four will snap on correctly to my laptop. The case stays on and does not budge, so it does the job, but it does not fit in the way it is intended to. The case also received a small crack at the top corner after only being in use for about two weeks, even though it hadn't been used in any harsh or unusual ways. Overall, I am very disappointed with the design and quality of this product, and I do not recommend purchasing it."
2,"Nice looking, good coloring... Just disappointed the bottom covers one of the ports. Also, the key covers include F1-F12 as the top row, which would cover the touch pad if I were to put it on... So at this point I'm only using half the product.. The plastic case is nice, but I'm disappointed that I ended up spending 20-something dollars to only use less than half the product.."
2,Dint even use it for a week and it already cracked very disappointed
2,Does not fit my 2020 13 inch MacBook Pro.
2,The case looks very nice but it is not durable at all. I haven’t even moved my laptop from my desk and the corners of the case are already chipping as if I’ve dropped my computer (I haven’t). Don’t waste your money on this.
2,One of the corners doesnt click in. What else can you expect for what you pay!
2,My case cracked all over the edges in just two weeks! Do not recommend
2,"I ordered this product as my computer frequently overheats. I had it for 1 month and 1 day and one of the 3 fans just stopped working. When I contact Amazon, they were no help at all. They stated the return period has passed as it was 1 day past the 30 days."
2,"The pad is great, in fact, this is my second. But the cord is trash. I knew this from the first go - it's about 6"" long, USB to USB and of poor quality. It won't last.But this time, it was broken out of the box. It's frayed right at the connection. I tend to try and support manufacturers by reaching out to them first, but when I emailed the customer service, the contact is no longer valid. Bottom line, if you do decide to buy this, highly consider that you will need a separate cord at some point. And if you're unlucky - that point will be right out of the box."
2,"Lesson learned. The most hyped product on Amazon is not necessarily the best. ""#1 Seller on Amazon."" I would imagine its rank is due to being the #1 most advertised on Amazon. This product is just okay. Certainly should not rank #1. I much prefer my Targus over this havit.PROs:*It works. It cools my laptop.CONs:*Annoying blue lights. I'm not sure why lights are needed for these products. Unnecessary.*USB cable in/out design is weak. The product includes a USB cable. However, the cable plugs into the front. Exposed, needless clutter. There is also an on/off switch. Not sure why an on/off switch is needed. If I want to turn off a USB powered product, can I not simply unplug the USB? Again. Needless.*Overall poor design. The plastic is on the weak side. This is especially apparent in the ""legs"" or as they say ""height adjusters"". The description states two height levels. I suppose this is true if they intend to say legs up or legs completely collapsed. The middle position was not stable on mine."
2,"It's very quiet, but I hate that I can't turn off the LED lights. I'm probably going to just buy another one, or rip this one open so I can break the LEDs."
2,"Literally useless, it’s cable is way short."
2,"It does the job, but two fans broke after less"
2,"You get what you pay for. It is not subjected to high heat, purchased merely as precautionary for 14” hp elitebook which does not emit much heat. One fan down in just over three months use. Would not recommend."
2,"It's a decent product. However, my laptop has small grips beneath the keyboards yet my laptop will slide off the cooling pad if it's at a downward angle. Very annoying. I would probably look somewhere else."
2,This product is quiet and works fairly well when there is a low amount of stress to my machine but it does not work well for high intensive tasks or a laptop with a lot of horsepower.I use a Lenovo Thinkpad P15 (i9)I am a software developer and I tend to run a lot of different processes at the same time and my laptop kept reaching 55-65C - which is not horrible but it’s not the best - hence the 2 stars.
2,It’s a good size. But the fans are not powerful at all. It doesn’t do anything for my laptop or keep it from heating up.
2,"It's quiet, but that's because the fans are weak and don't move much air.Also the lights are obnoxious in the dark as they never turn off."
2,"It worked really, really nicely for a bit. My laptop has had recent issues with overheating really badly while I'm running games or some applications I need for school. This cooling pad worked within minutes of using and kept my laptop cool to the touch. I would've given it 5 stars but seeing as I got it on March 9th, and I'm writing this review on the 21st to say that one of the fans have already stopped working has made me want to return it."
2,"It’s fairly quiet, but unfortunately this does not actually cool my gaming laptop at all."
2,So I bought the cooling pad today and I was really hyped because I thought it would help cooldown my laptop. But the thing is the fans don't even output a 1000 rpm's which for a gaming laptop is not a lot. Meaning it doesn't help like at all and isn't really worth buying. If that's the  reason you wanna buy it is for gaming.
2,it looks (appearene) is ok but it makes so noisy sound
2,Only had it for 3 months and it has stopped working :( I liked it while it lasted.
2,"Was really loving this product as it kept my temps almost 10 degrees cooler, but one of the fans died already so that makes me question the overall quality of the product after only a month of daily usage."
2,Not really impressed gonna wait and buy another one after this one goes out of commission!
2,Cheap plastic parts broke after 3 weeks.
2,"I had to build a ridge on the bottom, laptops just slide off of it.  There's no 'catch' or ridge built in so everything slides off ... it's NOT no slip, mine is actually FULL SLIP, the paint is slippery and everything slides off."
2,"My Mac gets hot during zoom calls and the fans ramp up, sometimes to max.  This is a nice pad, and is fairly quiet, but it has almost zero effect on bringing down the laptop temperature and slowing the fans.  In my case it was essentially a waste of money."
2,"This worked great for a few weeks, although it started vibrating intensely at a low frequency. It's extremely annoying."
2,"Exactly what you pay for, which isnt much. Its very light weight and big enough for many different size laptops. The bottom grips hold it in place real well but leave marks on white surfaces so watch out.  That being said, its not super sturdy. Feels a bit cheap and probably not gonna last a few falls.  Also the fans are big but the amount of wind it produces is minimal. It might be quiet but you cant feel the air it blows unless your literally touching it, so dont expect good air flow.  In the end, if your gonna keep it in one spot it will last and do a mediocre job. If your gonna take it traveling or want something that really cools a laptop, i suggest getting something better."
2,It was a nice laptop cooling mat for 3 months until one of the fans stopped working :\ It does an okay job at keeping my laptop cool but I guess it won't be as good now.
2,The fans on this product are silent but not very powerful.
2,"I bought this a year ago and use it daily, for many hours a day, with my laptop.  It has become noisy; occasionally I seem to hear a grinding sound."
2,USB cable stopped working after a couple weeks
2,Not sure what happened but after a few weeks of use it has stopped working.
2,"I was extremely pleased with this product, but after three uses it has stopped working. I have tried a few different power sources and all having the same result."
2,It has already broken
2,Mine didn’t come with any cord to connect... I still haven’t received the one I purchased separately... so still unsure of the quality of this item.
2,"I was initially very happy with this cooling pad. But 10 months after purchasing it, one of the ports became loose and stopped working. A month later the second port also broke. I'm very disappointed in an item that has so many great reviews and is an ""Amazon's Choice"" product. It should last longer than 11 months."
2,Poor product one fan has gone bad only 15 months.
2,"I have an asus fx503vd 15.6 inch and the only good came out of this is the quietness of it. The height adjustable did not working on my laptop it was slowly sliding down and cooling wasn't really great when you're playing games. So folks its not a ideal if you're thinking this will cool down your laptop while playing because it dont. Their support sucks haven't got a reply from them. So, if you're reading this, your product didn't meet my expectation and will not recommend this."
2,Not so useful
2,This is a good product for gamers but it stopped working after less than a year. If it was more durable it’d have been 5 stars.
2,"I was really excited for this to come in as I'm a gamer and overheating is a big issue! With this one, I did have a couple issues. Firstly one of the fans was broken and did not work. I could feel the motor vibrating but it wasn't spinning (I wasn't about to fiddle with it). I wasn't holding this against the product so I tried using it with the two fans to see if I wanted to return it for a new one and I found my second complaint. My laptop slides right off of it. There is nothing to hold the computer in place so if you use it on the incline, there is nothing stopping my computer from sliding down off of it. So unfortunately I am going to have to return this one unsatisfied. I hope others find this to be what they need!"
2,it doest have any holders to keep it Laptop very  uncomfortable to use .
2,"Granted, it is getting a lot more use over the last 4 months due to the 100% telework due to COVID-19.  I was able to silence the noise by raising the cooling pad a couple of inches, and then dropping it onto the desk.  :)  Not the best method of fixing things, but worked well for silencing the noise for a couple days at a time.  The lift and drop method is not working for more than a few seconds now."
2,this product failed to cool down my laptop. my laptop stayed at the same level of heat even after having the product run for 12 hours.  It is amazingly quite and very light wait but I was disappointed with the result.
2,"I bought this pad for my Lenovo Y740 and I can honestly say I threw my money straight to the trash with this product.This pad is not good at anything it should:- It is not able to lower a single degree of temperature of my laptop- If I turn it on without the laptop on it and put my hand on it, I cannot feel any air coming through. It is on, fans are moving, leds are on but: No airflow!- It makes a lot of noise because of bad quality. One of the fans is already making noises like if it was years old but it has barely 6 months of useIf you have heard cooling pads are usually not worthy, this specially isn't!Updated to 1 star to 2 stars because they issued a refund."
2,"Pros: options for flat or tilted surfacesCons: surface is slippery. The layout of the fans (if you keep the plug in the back) doesn't make sense when the main sources of heat are in the back of my laptops. Worst of all, one of the fans just stopped working. I've taken it apart trying to get it working again. Way overpriced; other laptop pads are better."
2,"the top fan did not work, the 2 lower fans did.  item was defective."
2,"One of the three fans made a loud grinding noise.  Too inexpensive to worry about replacing - took it apart and unplugged that one fan.  Also TALLER than I realized, but that's my fault."
2,This pad is noisy and it's not ergonomic for putting it on when I lay down and work. When I put it on slips and it's difficult to hold it.
2,"Didn't last a year on this, wasted money.  Purchased May 20 and it died March 2020 from moderate use."
2,"I bought it a year ago and now the fans are making a horrible noise so now I'm shopping again. You get what you pay for, I bought the cheapo one and got what I deserved."
2,"I used this for my gaming laptop for about a year. The fans did work at keeping my laptop cool, I could physically feel the difference touching my laptop so that was great. However it has a number of major design flaws and I will ultimately be purchasing something else because of them.1: The mesh screen isn't tough enough. If you have a heavier gaming laptop and you lift both the laptop and cooling pad up at once the weight of the laptop can push the mesh screen down and it hits the fans. This is probably what's killing my fans. One of them no longer functions. I have a laptop for portability, if I didn't want to move it I'd buy a desktop so not being able to move and lift the cooling pad without it bending and screwing things up is a problem.2: There isn't any way to lock your laptop in place. The pad works fine if you're using it on a flat surface but sometimes I wanted to just chill and play a casual game on the couch but I can't use the cooling pad at all there because any sort of tilt or motion causes the laptop to fly around.3: You can't turn off the blue lights. I hate them at night. Hate them. I am not an angsty teenager."
2,"I first got this item for my laptop, and since it seemed to work at the first glance, I went ahead and removed all the LEDs which was a mistake since I can't return it now. After doing that I actually checked the temps and it only increased or kept the temperatures the same. Anyhow, the noise level from my laptop didn't change at all, so this really was a waste of money."
2,"Pros: it’s quiet (laptop fans louder), inexpensive, decent build quality.Cons: it’s quiet because there’s hardly any air movement.Results: -.5 deg maybe? I even tried placing upside down so that the 2x fans blow air directly into the 2x laptop air intake vents. Very little to no difference. Def NOT for gamingLaptop: Razer blade 15"
2,Worked fine for 5 months.  Then it died.
2,useless
2,"Writing this review as a warning to others. The unit itself works exactly as advertised, and will keep a laptop cooler than nothing, but it is missing two key features. First off, there is not control on the fan speed. It's either on or off. Which, as long as you are aware of before purchasing, isn't that big of a deal. The second is that there is no ridge/flip/arm to keep the laptop on the cooling pad. When using the back legs to angle the laptop it is very susceptible to slipping off the pad."
2,"I used this with my macbook. Initially, out of the box, it worked! It worked well for two weeks about. That's when I stopped noticing how much air was blowing out the sides, and up into my computer. It was about another 2 weeks until I realized the thing had become completely useless. I'm looking at getting another one, but not from here. The difference in efficiency between week 1 and week 4 is ridiculous."
2,It was very quiet especially after 3 months when it stopped working.
2,"This would probably work really well , or if u use your computer on the floor, next to the outlet---Hooray! I'm so very tired of getting the wrong item  or a poorly conceived item from Amazon--this does not reach tony desk orbed or chair---the cord which must stay plugged when using, is too short to box with my computer,( leaving God out of it), so I have to search for or buy an additional item to have this one work for me. The first 3 items I bought in this area were futile :first item appeared immediately after the typed in specific item--Iordered it and it was simply wrong item. Second item --at least it was the correct category, but  altho time frame fitted the specs it would not work on that years' Mac.! I do not want to spend my life sending things back  to  Amazon  or purchasing more items to make the first item work. Never again!"
2,The fan on the right is not working.  I can't find the seller to complain. I did not want to give negative review so I would go no further. If he at least a part of my money or send another then I would be satisfied.
2,I don't care for this for several reasons 1 both my laptops slide all over the surface they don't grip to the surface. And to the on-off switch is in the back so it's very difficult to access. It's right next to two USB ports which make it even more difficult.  I'll be returning this shortly
2,"It's been about 5 months since I bought it and now one of the fans hits the edge of the frame so it is really loud and since it is hitting itself, it is unusable. :("
2,BROKE AFTER 3 MONTHS OF DAILY USE. Just stopped working. Have seen many other reviews saying the same thing. Cheap
2,LEDs are distracting as hell when you’re gaming
2,"I really wanted to like this - but it really didn't cool my laptop at all.  After having it on for several hours, I noticed no difference.  It also raised the laptop to an uncomfortable height from a typing perspective.  The only reason that I gave it 2 stars is because the blue light is neat when it is running."
2,"Does not fit nicely on my 17"" laptop, theres a solid 2 inch overhang of my laptop making it uncomfortable to use in my lapmHaven't noticed any improvement on my high running laptop. Wouldn't order agaib"
2,I would give it 5 stars except for the fact that one of the fans has already stopped working and I received at the end of April
2,"Disappointed given the great reviews. Very slippery material and laptop slides off the surface easily. Already have a skiff mark on a brand new laptop. Second, it is a a but small for any 17” gaming laptop unless you don’t mind the laptop overhanging the edges, also making it more unstable."
2,"This thing is cheap. The plastic is so cheap that just picking it up causes it to flex and impact the fans. It did nothing to affect my Dell G3 temperatures, in fact I think it ran hotter with the fans on, so I just keep them off. It's not that great as just a stand either because the laptop just slides on it. No grip at all. I'm debating returning it."
2,"Bought this 7 months ago, has already stopped working.  Very disappointed!"
2,It lasted about a year. And it did not work that great during the year. Laptop still overheated. I give it 2 stars because while it worked it was quiet.
2,Fans are incorrectly placed so the single rear fan in centered over an area that doesn't have vents. My laptop is still warm on the bottom even when it's idle. Very thick. Lifts laptops so high that typing is awkward. Bad design. Overpriced.
2,Worked well for a bit but after a few months one of the fans randomly stopped working :(
2,This product lasted a year and now it has stopped working. It may be the usb cord that’s bad but the fact that it has stopped working is annoying.
2,I found it to feel really cheap. You can not switch the directions the fans spin which can contradict air flow of the laptop.
2,Died in under a month had to buy a new one ..sad waste of money
2,"Barely any air, doesn't feel like it's actually cooling anything down. Expected more but that might be on me."
2,"It does what it says, but the slant of it when the feet are down is so severe that I have to stick something under the front to keep my computer from straight up sliding off onto the floor. It sucks. Should've had some sort of feet in the front to keep this from happening."
2,"Update: So I was unhappy with the LED lights when I posted this review yesterday, but now I can't use this cooling pad at all.  Once I had it set up and running, my Wifi signal was reduced to the point that I got completely disconnected twice.  The internet connection to my house and my router were working normally with no problems. Now that I've stopped using the pad, my connection is back to normal.  Maybe it's genuine problem, maybe it's a coincidence. I don't really know.  There are a lot of positive reviews and it works for a lot of people which is why I bought it.  But I'm not interested in trying to use it anymore.  I didn't like it that much to begin with.So I should have payed more attention to the description and reviews.  It does cool my laptop a little, which was the point of this purchase.  But the LED lights are terrible.  I use my laptop to watch videos and the piercing blue light it really hard on my eyes.  It reflects off the walls everywhere.  I had to cover up the front end of the platform because it was too much.  I'd cover up the sides as well but then it would defeat the purpose of cooling my laptop because there would be no airflow..The LED's in the fans are billed as an indicator that the fans are working.  There is no reason to have anything more than the small LED by the power switch.  While the fans are quiet, you can still hear them when they're on."
2,"My M1 MacBook Pro slides around in the sleeve and is not snug at all. Build is fine, just feels flimsy when my laptop is in it since it is so loose."
2,"This is at least 3-3.5"""" larger in width than my 13"" MacBook, the quality is great and I do like the case, soft interior which should keep itself but size is not correctly advertised in size so I just worry about it knocking around the sides too much."
2,"Lots and lots of extra room in the case with a 16-inch MacBook Pro.  Given that this is already a very large machine, it’s hard to justify a laptop sleeve that unnecessarily adds even more area to the overall footprint."
2,Really large for a 13 inch laptop. Tons of extra space and doesn’t fit well into my bag as a result
2,"too big for 13 inch laptop, didn’t fit quite right"
2,I ended up returning this item as it is not a true hunter green.
2,Just got the product so I'm not apeak to its durability.  I did order burgendy/wine and received a very bright pink. I dont like the color pink at all. Not satisfied.
2,"The sleeve itself is okay, but it has a horrible unpleasant smell that I have not been able to get rid off."
2,"Case is too big for a 13' computer. Just doesn't fit snugly, and doesn't feel secure. Feels cheaply made."
2,Zipper broke after using for less than a year.
2,Disappointed. Very flimsy. Do not feel comfortable sending my son off to college with his brand new MacBook in this.
2,"I purchased this case for taking my computer to and from work. I carry it in my backpack but wanted some extra protection. The zipper started sticking within a month and shortly after the fabric started ripping along the zipper, so now the zipper is not functional. I liked the simplicity of this case, but will need to look for something higher quality."
2,"Hardly ever used and it already broke the zipper, very disappointing. I cannot return and there is not warranty...cheap product."
2,"I got the size that said it was for a MacBook Air 2018-2020, but it's way too big for my computer. I'll most likely be sending it back."
2,"It's a nice bag but unfortunately much too big for my MacBook Air, both in the length and width."
2,I love this case overall but the zip broke within days.
2,Really poor quality.  Feels very cheap and both zippers broke after 6 weeks or so.
2,Poor design flaw-The zip on the side pocket makes it impossible to fit an A4 size refill pad which is quite annoying
2,Have had the item since July but only actually used the cover for a month and the zipper broke.
2,The zipper came damaged. Very difficult to close the front pocket.
2,"Cheap. Zipper kept getting stuck, and now after only 2 weeks of use, there is a tear. Won’t be buying this brand again."
2,"Not so slim, even though the sleeve I bought is the correct size for my computer, it’s still slides inside.The thing I hate the most is the company’s logo on the bottom right. It just doesn’t look good with the sleeve."
2,Not sure if I was sent wrong size or not. Your laptop will slide around within the case. Be careful
2,Zipper broke after six weeks of use.
2,"Even though it's made for the MacBook Pro 13-13.3 in. it was still a bit large even with the case and it will move around. I had to return it because the size makes it difficult to carry. Additionally, the ""new"" case came with a large dent that was noticeable as soon as I opened it."
2,"Very good quality inside, but looks cheap on the outside, don't like the feel of the fabric"
2,Disappointed i loved the case it fit my laptop great however one knock on a door jam when trying to manuever a stroller ruined my screen :( I got this one due to the shock resistance feature as an extra layer of protection.
2,"After a months use, one of the zippers got jammed at the corner. Had to pull the zipper very hard in order to take out my laptop."
2,The zipper has come apart in a corner and cannot fully open.  Very poor quality. Will not buy again.
2,"One of the zippers jammed at the corner of the opening on the 2nd use....meaning my laptop was stuck in the bag! Thought I was going to have to cut the bag to retrieve my laptop! Finally after working the zipper for about 10 minutes I got it open just enough to retrieve my laptop! Feels cheap in general, but for the price I could have overlooked that had the zipper held up. Another concern is there doesn't seem to be anything protecting the back of the zipper from scraping against the laptop while zipping/unzipping - which will scratch the laptop if you are not super careful. Had high hopes, but I'm returning this sleeve."
2,It was all fine until I noticed the chains scratched my brand new laptop. It scratched my speaker grill and discolored the white coating cover. It also left a dark groove on the side of the display. I was really sad and disappointed.
2,"The case itself is fine -- solid quality case. However, I was sent the wrong size -- 15"" instead of 13"". It doesn't fit my laptop at all."
2,Flimsy Material Gets Dirty Too Fast ! Not Much Protection .
2,"The zipper is very cheap, it actually doesn't even zip up. But the case itself gets the job done, I am just a little disappointed with the zipper.."
2,Bad in quality. Not worth the money
2,"Not snug around MacBook Pro 13”. In my opinion not suitable for this laptop, just a generic size which is misleading."
2,"Dislike how the legs fold up, not wanting the legsTo just fold and everything falls."
2,"Not stable, folds up, can’t use because afraid will spill food all over me."
2,Unfortunately this product did not increase my Wi-Fi reception. Maybe it works for other people.
2,"I purchased this repeater to extend my Verizon wifi out to my porch one level up. The distance is not far at all and I even tried it with the repeater in an outlet outside. The wifi EXT is simply not usable: too slow, weak signal. Separately the speed test from the extender simply right next to my main router shows that the extension is 1/3 of the MBPS download and upload speeds. Is this product broken? Am I missing a setting? At this point the repeater is useless."
2,Quit working after less than six months.  Would not recommend.
2,No improvements in signal noted
2,Connected to the network in <1 minute.  Allowed me to connect an old PC to my network via wired ethernet connection at the bottom of the extender. Problems started almost immediately.  It appeared to drafting some of the signal and was literally blocking other devices from connecting to the network they were already accessing before the extender was installed.
2,I needed a wifi extender to give me 2.4 ghz for my smart plugs and push stronger 5ghz signal to some of the rooms in the back of the house.The thing was not hard to install BUT do not expect any decent wall penetration so you will probably get no signal.It’s so weak that my iphone does not see the wifi signal unless i am standing in an interrupted path of it. It’s a waste of money.
2,Absolutely no results not worth even a penny
2,You can sort of set it up. Once it's connected you lose the ability to modify settings. It does have good range but the lack of ability to customize anything once it's connected makes it almost useless.
2,"Have to use app, signal not stable"
2,I tried both using WiFi and hard wiring but it didn’t help our signal.
2,The connection is still not great in my home...just a little better than before.
2,Not easy to install unless you spent the money not stated for their app!! Directions can be confusing. I finally got it to work with Amazon tech support. An unhappy customer 😠.
2,"After about 2 hours of trying and re-trying to link this extender to my wi-fi router, it finally seemed to connect when I used the WPS button. Maybe should have tried that first. At any rate, now that I was connected, I moved the extender, per instructions, away from my router and closer to the ""dead zone"" area I wanted to cover. The problem is an outdoor wi-fi camera that was only getting about 30% - 40% signal strength which is borderline operational. I placed the extender in an outlet that is no more than 6 feet away from the camera mounted just on the other side of the wall. When I checked the camera for signal strength again, 30% was the best I got. NO IMPROVEMENT.  It Is entirely possible that I am doing something wrong, so I will try to contact TP-Link customer service and I will update this review accordingly."
2,Not the best
2,It was advertised to be better than the one we had before but we have not seen an better service and have gone back to using our old one!
2,We have tried it for a few months now and still get no signal in the garage next to it and it’s only 10 feet away from our router.
2,Wifi signal continues to go in and out. Its cuts off on and off by itself. Like the thing helped expand but it made the wifi weaker and it barely ever stays connected.
2,I can use my existing WiFi anywhere in my house.  I wanted to extend it to an outside area.  I had to plug in the extender no more than line of sight 20 feet away to get an acceptable signal to it.  Any further and the signal was poor.  The transmitted range is not much better.  I can not extend my WiFi range if I have to be that close to the WiFi Router.  Not a very useful device.  I would not recommend it.
2,The extender has to be close to the router and it does not extend very far.
2,Waste of money. No effect on the signals
2,"The extender was easy to install. Tested the speed of our wifi @ the location we plugged in the extender before install and we had 234 Mbps. After install the wifi signal was definitely stronger BUT the speed went down to a mere 17 Mbps. If the extender can not extend the signal while maintaining the integrity of the internet speed, there is no point to it. Big disappointment. This will be returned."
2,This unit creates a new network and doesn’t extend you current network. I just wanted a relay for my existing network. Not clearly stated in what I read.
2,It’s a slick thing but would not complete the connection to my router. Not sure why. I watched videos and checked what I could.
2,Waste of money.
2,Could not tell any difference in WiFi coverage around the house. Still have the same old dead spot downstairs. Glad I wasted the money
2,Install was not straight forward but I did get it installed. Too many youtube videos out there with incorrect info.I have a 1200 sqft apartment.I  finally got the WiFi extender installed and placed it in a hallway that had a 20tf direct line of site to my router and across from the doorway where the TV was located  After I got it installed and paired the TV came up and worked for a few minutes but the signal was dropped within a few minutes. I tried it a few times over the next 24 hours and found it to be more unreliable than the WiFi coming directly from the router.
2,Too hard to install
2,"Dislike this product, it didn't work."
2,"A little disappointed.  When my cable & internet went out, this WiFi gadget was of no use.  I STILL could not use my laptop to do any work."
2,This did very little to improve my WiFi signal and my apartment is not that big. Pretty disappointed
2,"It could be the signal strength in the area I live, but this device is worthless. Since having to work from home it has not helped much with maintaining connectivity."
2,Can't automatically switch between regular and _ext sids. The _ext is only 50% as fast as the regular sid. I won't recommend it. Can't return because by the time I have made up my mind it is more than 30 days.
2,It didn’t help to extend our WiFi at all.
2,Not much boost
2,"Purchased this specifically to connect wyze doorbell camera. I can get the link setup and working with my phone, but it doesn't seem to be compatible for what I got it for. Too late to return it so I'm just stuck with it."
2,It did nothing to improve my wifi experience 🥲
2,Not worth the money
2,Didn't increase wifi signal downstairs
2,"Did not help, should have sent it back"
2,"This wifi extender does not work properly, signal is very weak!"
2,"My in-home wifi isn’t great to begin with, so there’s that. But with this repeater, it is just not usable. A video stops every 2 minutes, and wifi calling is just static. Going to have to buy something else."
2,Had this for about 8 months and honestly I’d recommend to get another. It loses signal every couple weeks and it’s so difficult to reset it. I always have problems w it.
2,It works but it cut speed down by 25 to 50%.
2,"I thought an extender would extend my existing network but the tp-link creates a new network based on the existing one but the wifi-signal is strongest at the back of the house, but weaker at the front where the main router is.  I have to manually switch networks if I’m noticing a weak connection as I move through the house.  I feel like I could’ve set it up wrong, but even though plugging it in and set up is fairly simple it it not that easy to install.  Tech support was not helpful."
2,"The signal for the 2ghz band is strong enough, but on both networks I have plugged these into, the 5 ghz band is weaker than the source, even standing next to it."
2,Made our internet system not function correctly and didn’t boost as one room away
2,"Connection is horrible, even when right next to it."
2,Sucks for gaming which was the reason I got it for
2,"I bought two for my 1600 square foot townhouse because the signal and cell reception in my neighborhood is terrible. Unfortunately, I cannot tell any difference."
2,I want to use an I pad on the patio which is 20' from the extender and it isn't helping. I also have a WYZE outdoor camera that I want to work even further away and now I have no idea whether it really can function there or not. There doesn't seem to be any tech support and its blamed on Covid. Not a good combination.
2,"Had to return as WiFi became painfully slower throughout the house, even though extension did work."
2,East to set up but doesn’t boost the wifi as described. Everything working correctly but no improvements.
2,This thing was great at the beginning and it was easy to install and came in perfect condition but for the last 2 months the wifi extender has not been working at all. There seems to be no wifi signal anymore. I cant return it now. This sucks. Look for another product that will last a long time.
2,Have not been able to get it close enough to wifi to connect. That makes it kind of worthless as a wifi extension.
2,It sucks.  It didn't help at all.  Save your money!
2,Not worth the money.
2,Installation was easy but the data transfer speed was severely lacking. Even in the dead spots I had bought this product for I still had a significantly faster connection with my original router.
2,This worked for a day then  suddenly stopped working or seeing my wifi. No idea why. Resetting didn't help. It was tedious to try to connect to get it to work. Ended up being way more headache than it was worth.
2,Does not work well with vpn networks
2,It’s okay but not great it always turns off and needs to be rebooted
2,I still have trouble with connecting to internet with device.  Would not purchase again.
2,The extender will cut the main signal into half its bandwidth by default so don't expect the same bandwidth across the mesh.
2,It didn't help.
2,Sucks. Didn’t help extend my internet upstairs at all. Still same poorQuality.
2,For some reason it totally loses signal at least once a day so if you’re in the middle of a game it will just shut off. Unreliable
2,"Very unhappy with this product! It was difficult to install and I was unable to get a signal one room over. I constantly lose signal during Zoom calls, despite sitting right next to the extender. I was never able to connect the extended to both the 2G and 5G networks, so this was useless. I got a new router from the internet company and am now unable to reset and reinstall this extender. Customer service was unavailable to assist in the setup. I would not recommend this product."
2,Initially it was easy to set up and worked for a few months. The speeds were never great but it was acceptable. After a couple of months it constantly required a power cycle reset and occasionally a reset button reset. Can't get it to work now no matter what trouble shooting attempt I do. I bought it in April 2020. Obviously not very durable. I'd look elsewhere to solve dead spots in your house.
2,"It installed alright.  I got this because one bedroom of my house has a poor spot for speed.  After installing this, I tried it in 9 different locations upstairs and downstairs.  I got worse speeds than even with just the router. Half the speeds even.  With the rotuer alone, that bedroom gets around 75Mbps.  Sometimes less.  After connecting this device, the best I got was 50Mbps.  Even that was not consistent.  It would drop to 25 often.  Now, this is the second one I have tried over the years.  Neither I tried were worth anything.  Are these devices a scam?"
2,"I couldn't send this item back, because of Covid. Couldn't travel, so I missed the send back date."
2,"INSTALLED in middle of home. Kept dropping WIFI.Could not get ALEXA add ons to work proprerly.WIFI address interred with other products due toaddress name assigned ?  Past return, but I'll research anothervendor."
2,Doesn’t work to well at all.
2,weak signal
2,Disrupted my signal. Not very good.
2,"Simple to install but unfortunately placing it close enough to my current router meant that the extended signal is no better or worse at distance to the existing router. My current router is a TP-Link AC1900 Archer C9. I had to replace this with the more expensive AC1750 extender which seems to do the trick. The other issue is that I need it for mainly is for security cameras that I don't want to give access to the main disk system so I attach them to the 'guest' network.  An extender like this can only extend one network so I have to pick the guest one. I'm not sure if setting the SSID to the same name as the main network will cause problems , I'll update this when I find out."
2,The WiFi signal keeps going in and out. It’s not what I thought it would be. I’m going to send it back. Totally disappointed.
2,Bad product
2,"I could only have the 2.4 GHZ to work. My wife bought a Christmas tree that needed a 2.4 ghz step down router, so, I used this thing. It was a pain in the but to connected it to the tree. I guess it worked but it wasn't flawless. I don't recommend it."
2,Didn’t do anything helpful at all.
2,Worthless product. Installed to extend another TP product 5G signal. Works intermittently but drops signal WAY too often. Not worth the couple bucks it cost.
2,Wifi isn’t good at all same service without it.
2,Didn’t work to extend the WIFI in my home for the needs and Verizon FIOS system I have. It might be fine for some but sorry didn’t work for us.
2,Technician told us not to use makes signal weaker
2,"I have had this product for a few months.  I purchased it because of the reviews and my personal experience with other TP-Link products.  We started experiencing wifi dropouts shortly after adding this device to our network.  Initially I thought that it was because of the router, so we replaced the router with a higher-end product from TP-Link. After a few months of ""detective"" work, I noticed that the drop out happens when the unit heats up. Customer support agreed to exchange it but they wanted me to send the unit back (my expense) and wait until they ship another unit, which meant being without a repeater for up to two weeks.  I replaced it with another brand and all is okay.  I don't recommend it because I think the ""heating"" problem is likely to be common to this line of product."
2,"Bought 2 in October, they turned red in late December, just after the return window closed.  Rather than arguing w Amazon, I splurged on Eero Pro 6 Mesh WiFi system, allowing me to place these TP's where they belong... in the garbage."
2,It didn’t boost the signal in any noticeable way.
2,If you can get around the horrible customer service and their inability to help over the phone this product is for you. Difficult to get the unit to recognize my wifi and after a 2 hour call it finally recognized the unit and allowed me in to set up and secure my wifi signal. It was a relief to get it done coming from a very tech savy person.
2,"If you need a reliable wifi extender DO NOT BUY THIS. You can't reliably connect to the TP link device and it has no consistent internet connection, which is the purpose."
2,would not recommend
2,"I live in a small house, did not improve reception in my dead zone. Also phone kept viewing notofication that it was connecting to usb and transferring info. Concerned about privacy of info as well as disappointed by failure to improve internet reception."
2,It works for a few days at a time- then it starts making the wifi router signal real weak to the point I have to disconnect this product and reboot router.  It is not an effective extender.  Too troublesome.
2,"Very poor WiFi signal, not at all working for basic 😞"
2,"Not very stable, sometimes work, sometimes not"
2,The switch was not new.Shrink wrapped in plastic but missing hardware and someone tried to reprogramed it.We had to reset to factory defaults
2,"All of the sudden today I lost connection to my local network, and it was traced down to the switch which I bought almost exactly one year ago. I was hoping it would be the power adapter since I have a few from other devices that match the specifications but unfortunately it wasn't that."
2,Ports are losing connections. After two days two ports stopped working.  After two weeks another port was not connecting.  Needing to buy another device after two weeks of purchase.
2,"When I plug my PC directly up to my router I get over 200 Mb per second. When I added in this switch I only got less than 100 Mb per second. This is a plug and play unit with no configuration, so I plugged it in and it didn’t play."
2,"I recently deployed this switch for a client who needed to upgrade their network to Gigabit Ethernet. This switch worked great for a few hours after we deployed it, but sometime overnight died and would not pass traffic on any ports. I got ""the call"" that every tech guy dreads the next morning that the network was down. The power light stayed lit but no ports would pass any traffic (no activity lights). Tested it on the bench with two devices - nope - none of the ports worked anymore.I've since ordered a replacement and am hoping for one that works as intended."
2,"Not too happy that I bought this because product description stated ""Easy Smart Managed"".  ""Unmanaged"" not shown anywhere in product details (i.e. I though I was purchasing a ""Managed"" Switch).  Product listing also shows image of packaging which did not show any language regarding ""Unmanaged"".  However, once package arrived, ""Unmanaged Pro"" shows prominently on product packaging.  I returned without even opening packaging.  Again, not happy about the misleading product description (false advertising)."
2,"There are mixed messages in the Q/A for this product, however, the unit shipped to me does not have a web interface. It also doesn't have the reset to factory defaults button (with no web interface, you don't need a password hence no reset).  This is really disappointing as I would like to have this to monitor the port information without having to view the switch.  Aside from this, the product works well, looks good and is sturdy."
2,"The management pages tend to fall on their face when you need them, timing out.Very frustrating."
2,Model number ends in (UN). This suggests it is not the US version and the device cannot be registered. This maybe why I had a difficult time logging into the web-based GUI.
2,Bought this 7/2016 and it started dropping connection and needed to be unplugged  and plugged in again around a year ago. Unplugging/plugging seemed to work for a while but now no response at all. More junk for the land fill.
2,"This managed switch says it is for business on its box, but it has no HTTPS support. So explain how is this for business?!! We are in 2020. Price is fair, for its features. However, no https is a deal breaker to me."
2,"You would think ordering from Amazon that you would get the latest version of the product.  Not for this.  The latest version is hardware version 5 released in 2019.  I received version 4, released in 2018. It works well, and for the price I'm not going to complain further.  TP-Link says v5 and v4 have only cosmetic differences, but they have different firmware, so I doubt this."
2,This didn't work very well so returned it. Our printer kept losing connection as well as the small router for some alexa controlled lights.
2,"I had trouble from the very beginning trying to access the switch to be able to program it. When I finally was able to get access to it, it would not hold the program longer than 15 minutes so that fact that it was a managed port was useless"
2,"Switch died less than 5 months since purchase.  Worked fine until then.  TP_link told me they would send me a replacement after registered on their website.  Once I did, they wanted me to pay $14.99 for the replacement.  I paid $16.99 for the original switch.  Way not worth my time or to spend more money on something that broke 5 months from buying here.  Going back to Netgear!"
2,Item maybe defective so get it replaced ASAP or get your money back.  Otherwise you loose 20 dollars just like that.
2,Signal drop when using all 5 ports?
2,"Didn't respond to port 80 from a web browser at all even though in theory this is supposed to work. I have a mac, and the Java-based management software only runs on PC. Luckily I have Parallels. Anyhow, I eventually got it working but still no web browser management on the V4 hardware version of this device. VLANS are a pain as you have to set a PVID separately from assigning a port to be untagged. Most switches do this automatically."
2,"Replaced some dying old Netgear switches (more than 5 years old) with this one (TL-SG108E). Actually I got 4 of them! Was extremely happy with the functionality, and not having to use that stupid ""ProSAFE Plus Utility"" that only works on Windows! I don't use Windows! Everything worked as expected, the Web-GUI was very basic but did what it was intended to, and I was a happy camper!Then about 18 months or so later, I start getting weird outages! Sporadically/randomly I would loose connection to servers on my network (ICMP not responding), and the internet gateway! It would be intermittently and random, and after a reboot of switch/router/server/etc. it would go away for a couple of days to weeks. It was never in the same spot, so very hard to troubleshoot and figure out! Had gotten more HomeAutomation-gadgets, so I thought maybe I had a multicasting and/or STP issue! Made sure loop-detection was enabled on all switches, which it already was, but no dice, it would intermittently come back! Kept thinking it was multicasting on my network from all ""smart"" devices causing this. Replaced one of these TL-SG108E with a GS108Ev2 I got my hands on, and suddenly I had no issues for the devices connected to that switch! But for my main computer still on a TL-SG108E, I would have to power-cycle it every 2-3 days, sometimes several times that day, to get it to pass traffic!Needless to say, since a couple of weeks, I switched over to a couple more of the GS108Ev3, and have not seen any issues yet! Netgear now wants you to pay $10 a year per device with their new ""Insight"" app. But the stupid old ""ProSAFE Plus Utility"" still works (on Windows only), but states ""end-of-life"" on their webpages. Lets see how long the Netgear train lasts! At least their switches seems to work once configured!"
2,I had this 24 port switch for a couple weeks and it started getting flaky it would just stop routing traffic completely and you had to power cycle it every couple days.  I had a very solid network prior to this so it was noticable. It was actually replacing an 8 port TP Link switch that I had zero issues with. I ended up returning 24 port one.
2,"This is a typical, consumer-grade ethernet switch: they seem to work fine for a year or two, then they get buggy.  I tried the TP-Link 5 Port Gigabit Ethernet Network Switch for three reasons: (1) the metal housing hinted at above average construction; (2) they offered a useful warranty, in this case a ""lifetime"" limited warranty; and (3) I've had good luck with other TP-Link products, so I hoped this would would work too.Unfortunately, almost on schedule this switch started misbehaving about eighteen months after purchase.  It didn't actually fail dead, it just had to be ""rebooted"" a couple of times a day by unplugging the power for a few seconds.Usually this would have been right after the warranty expired.  But hey, I had this LIFETIME warranty, so I called their support number.  Well first, don't call them weekends or evenings because they keep strictly normal business hours.  Then when you do finally get through be very patient, because the service representatives speak very little English.  They will ask you to reconfigure the ethernet connections to the switch several ways, none of appear to make any sense.  Then if it does work (remember, I had an repeating, intermittent problem) they declare the problem solved, refuse to investigate further, and will not open a service ticket to track the problem.  So, when it recurred the next day (and the next after that, etc...) I would have togo through the whole thing again.  On one call I was actually told that the service representative had to leave: it was closing time and her shift was over, so I would have to call back the next day.After five tries I gave up on the warranty, and eventually gave up and replaced the switch.  TP-Link's switch is no better, and no worse, than several others I have used over the years.  Just don't believe their warranty: they know you really can't enforce it, and they have a system in place designed to wear you down so they don't have to honor it."
2,TPLink website lists hardware version 1.20 as the most recent hardware version available - What I received from this seller was hardware version 1.0. :(Considering concerns regarding cyber and having the most updated versions to protect networks - I was surprised that older hardware versions are being shipped.Not happy - But stuck with a situation were I have to get this installed. :(
2,I was very disappointed with this unit. I would only be able to connect one device to it. The second I connected another router or laptop that device would not receive signal.Not sure if it was a faulty unit or this model lacks that feature (which doesn't make sense since this is a splitter)
2,Disliked when it quit on me.
2,Couldn't get it working no instructions
2,"After any network change, or after a power failure, I've discovered I need to cycle the power of the switch to restore network connectivity.  A strange issue.  Took a while to pin down my networking issues to this switch.  First issue I've ever had with a TPLink device."
2,"Docking openings are spaced very tightly and fail to consistently hold the ethernet cord locking clips. Electrically, this unit worked flawlessly."
2,"Did not work with my 3 devices, ps4 didnt recognize it as an internet connection. My PC was an unstable connection."
2,"I have been testing, but it disappointed me."
2,The switch is great but the PSU they supplied is not strong enough to power the switch under full load without creating a coil wine.It is a horrid noise that only happened when the switch was under a decent load. Replacing the Wall-Wort with a new PSU  Higher Amp Output works but this something they need to address.
2,"Today (Tuesday, November 20, 2018) I received two of these TP-Link 5-port model TL-SG105E Gigabit switches (firmware version is V4) and the installation is simple and easy and they look sturdy.  No on/off switch but that would be asking for too much on such a small and affordable gigabit switch.  You can connect to it for status and simple config changes ( default IP is 192.168.0.1, and credentials admin/admin so you need to set your PC's IP to 192.168.0.2 with subnet mask 255.255.255.0 to be able to connect to it).  Everything except one thing listed below works as expected and I already checked if there were any firmware upgrades and it seems to have the latest firmware TL-SG105Ev4_en_1.0.0_[20180306-rel72616]_up.My biggest problem is no loop protection whatsoever, and I ordered them just because they claim they have it.  I connected it to my other switch and when I loop it (connect two ends of the same Ethernet cable to it), not only does it get overwhelmed but it also overwhelms the entire network with the same horrible broadcast storm like  switches without any loop protection do.  Look elsewhere for loop protection."
2,This little switch was fine until recently it started dropping packets which most people might not notice typically but my SSH sessions would drop within 10 seconds of connecting. Swapping out the switch cured the issue but it took me several hours of ruling out other possible problems to finally figure this out.
2,I have a 3 year old computer from boxxtech they use top of the line hardware for 3d rendering and gfx vfx work. So I hightly doubt theyd put less than a gigabit connection in it. It has an asus gryphon z87 board in it. As far as I've looked up it has a gigabit  ethernet port in it.
2,"I was able to set this up to meet my functional needs with VLANs and trunking. However, I am noticing the same fatal security issues with the VLAN function other users have found. VLAN 1 can never be removed from a port, broadcasts that ingress on VLAN 1 appear on all ports, and the management interface will respond on any port as long as the management subnet has been configured. This is unacceptable and I don't want to hear about how they want to support novice no-nothing users. TP-Link blatantly ignores the 802.1Q VLAN specification. This device is broken. I am going back to the defacto standard Netgear Smart Managed Plus."
2,"Experienced 10ms local latency and constant package loss, don't buy it for gaming purpose."
2,"Even after connecting to an air-gapped old laptop with RJ45 connector and re-programming it to be DHCP (it ships with a static IP), it caused the whole network to fail due to conflicts with the internet gateway server. NOT an out-of-the-box device. Apparently this has something to do with managed vs. un-managed systems."
2,"Works as a switch if you just using it for Internet connection. However, if you are trying to route a DVR signal through this switch (i.e. ATT Users wireless receiver) it will not pass the IPTV signal properly.  In that situation the switch become useless"
2,"Way too much stutter, and delay than normal, in your connection when you hook this up."
2,I’ve having more issues with my tp-link gear throughout the house. One of the ports on this switch is already bad and it’s not even that old yet.
2,no technical support
2,Keeps randomly losing it's IP assignment for no apparent reason.  Not correlated to power cycling either.  Otherwise works fine.
2,Slows everything down.  somewhat disappointed.
2,Could not get this device to produce Gigabit speeds to computers.  Attempted to contact support but no answer.  Returned switch
2,"Makes a pretty loud coil-whine noise that I had trouble muffling even after I put it in a drawer in a cabinet.  Definitely some points lost there. Had some issues after I connected it where I had to restart my network as well.  Not sure if that was due to this switch or some other network configurations, but I haven't had to do this since I got another brand's switch to replace this one.  Holding on to this switch for now, maybe I'll use it in a low-traffic area someday."
2,"I needed a 802.1q aware VLAN switch to subdivide a run to my garage where I have LAN devices and my cable modem.  This is connected to an EdgeRouter PoE 8 with two separate VLANs for WAN and LAN. For whatever reason, this switch, while configured properly caused all sorts of issues with ARP resolution on my LAN VLAN. Every minute or so my devices would lose connectivity during an ARP query, and broke network access during these outages. Oddly, the WAN side (other VLAN) seemed to be unaffected. I replaced with a Netgear 5-Port GS105E and all my problems went away instantly. As a plus with any firmware above 1.3.0.3 (currently 1.4.0.6) the Netgear has a web gui. It was very annoying to have to plug my laptop into the LAN segment to manage this. The Netgear is the same price after the current rebate.I can also attest to the common complaint about the whining power adapter as well."
2,"Works fine in terms of speed and reliability.  But I can confirm the high-pitched whine--it's intolerable.  I can hear it more when there's data traffic, in really high pulses.  Given the reviews of others, I have not attempted to return it.But unless this is inside a closet or in a remote location, the noise is going to be an issue.  I put it under a bookshelf and it's still completely audible.  It's not a ""white noise"" that you get used to; it makes it difficult to work in my office, and it's been several months now."
2,"I'm going to be honest - this review isn't about switching performance, switching fabric, non-blocking multicast routing, or anything pertaining to what most people think matters. This review is about a power supply. Last I checked, it's 2016 and we figured out a long time ago how to make power supplies with components like capacitors that didn't squeal and hiss when energized. Last I checked, quality control on these things was something that could be done by a human with ears. I wouldn't be so angry if this switch were destined for the communications closet, or a noisy server room, but this is called a ""desktop"" switch, as in ""put this on your desktop and likely plug it in nearby"" switch. The CONSTANT squeal and hiss of this terrible 9v power supply is enough to drive a sane man to rage.The switch does a great job on the network front, but it CANNOT stay in my home. The power supply alone is enough to knock 3 stars off. It would be more if the switch didn't do its job. Jesus, TP-LINK, what kind of Mickey Mouse operation are you running where a power supply so terrible would leave the factory? This product speaks volumes about your margins, your willingness to cut corners, and your lack of concern for the people who will use this product. ASICs are so cheap these days, the switching silicon is so cheap, I'll be you're making at least eight or nine dollars per unit. I'll be you're glad you saved $.0009 per capacitor!"
2,"No management except by a really bug riddled Windows app...Almost junk except for the fact that it does a moderate job at switching....Don't buy if you need a managed switch or do anything real beyond basic low tps switching.Okay in your setup lab, but I wouldn't use it in any volume environment."
2,"The TL-SG108E is a weird device. It's technically not a managed router but it offers a lot of the features of one. But in order to use these features you have to jump over an incredible number of technical hurdles. Especially if you don't run Windows. The retail box lies. Linux and Mac devices are not supported.TP-Link intentionally removed the web-interface for these so they don't compete with their managed router series. Instead you have to use their proprietary Java application that only works on one specific, ancient version of Java. And all the Java app does is connect to a non-standard webserver running on the device that it finds by UDP broadcast. But on any system other than Windows (which has a broken network stack in this regard) you have to set up ipv4 forwarding in your firewall and add specific rules so the crappy Java software can even find the switch.Once you've spent an hour and have all that set up you'll finally be able to change the default password to secure the switch. Configuration is done via the Java GUI but you can export as a configuration file. By manually editing this file you can make changes to the config but you still have to use the Java GUI to re-upload it.It's feature packed but those features are intentionally hamstringed by TP-Link to protect their more expensive managed switches. And unless you're technically adept you won't even be able to secure the device and use it as a normal switch. Actual performance is decent but the VLAN stuff, while obstensibly working, doesn't do network separation; an attacker on VLAN1 can spoof the ARP table for other VLANs. So it works but not for security, so it's useless."
2,Had to return it due to a very very noisy PSU.
2,Does the job but damn is that high pitch whining from the ac adapter unbearable. I'm currently looking for a replacement one that's bettter built as to not make noise while powering the switch.
2,"I have three switches in my house (other brands) and a TP-LINK router.  This works fine does what it should.  So here's the issue: the power supply whines.  I have the device in a closet and every time I walk in there it is the high pitch whining noise.  I have switched out the power strip is on to make sure it is not a connection or plug issue, it's not.If you keep this in a cabinet somewhere probably wouldn't bother you but if you are in the same room with it unless you have significant hearing loss I cannot recommend this product.  I would have returned it but I bought it and did not immediately put it into use as the rest of my wiring project was was not ready.  Maybe I got a bad one, don't know but it's really unacceptable."
2,Works well but made a consistent loud high-pitched sound when connected to a network. Very annoying so sent it back.
2,"The switch is functional and does what it says, which gets it two stars; however, there is a significantly loud ""capacitor whine"" once connected, which is driving me nuts. This is my first TP-Link purchase for networking, and I am not impressed. I will be purchasing a switch from a different company and returning this for a refund."
2,"This review is specifically for the 5-port un-managed switch. It's hard to write separate reviews about parts of a unit so my number of stars may be unfair to the quality of the switch itself. However, the high pitch noise coming from the adapter is unbearable. Amazon customer service was nice and immediately shipped a new unit that happened to disappoint me even more with the adapter noise. I must emphasize that the adapter seems to be at fault. The unit worked fine under normal traffic. I also have an 8-port version of this brand and the adapter does not make such an annoying noise."
2,"Switch works just fine.  AC adaptor has the worst capacitor whine I've experienced.  Exchanged for a new one, replacement has the same whine.  Will be returning this one for a refund and getting something else."
2,"It works, but at the price of an incredibly annoying high pitch noise coming from the AC adapted. Returning it and looking for a different brand, because looking at the reviews shows that this issue is common and TP-LINK doesn't care to fix it."
2,"Does what its supposed to do, but emits a high pitched whine while in use. Very annoying. Sent back my first one, and the replacement had the exact same whine. Sent the second back and bought a 5 port Trendnet switch. Works perfectly and no whine. So if you are going to have this switch somewhere in the same room as you, be aware it might be drive you nuts with the whine."
2,"Not sure what is up, the unit is fine the power brick makes really really annoying high pitch sound.Its a shame because I really wanted to like it, I do not know why this unit does that I like the small size of the adapter but the continuous noise is really annoying!"
2,"Pros:Seems to work ok.Cons:Coil whine. High pitched noise is unacceptable for a desktop switch. I guess I will have to return it and try another brand. Also the fact that the ports are on the front, but the power plug is in the back is a bit annoying."
2,"It works.  However, had a very high pitched whine / screeching noise when turned on.  Back to Amazon it goes, guess I'll try a different brand."
2,"Did not function out of the box, and even interfered with my router to the point that my wife's laptop would drop in and out of Wi-Fi (the only hardware change I made was to remove this switch and put in another one and everything was fine). There were no instructions pointing to the need to perform any kind of setup, so I'm assuming it should've worked out of the box. Ended up returning to Amazon."
2,"no web interface, easy to lose CD with windows only software. Connecting trunked vlans with Cisco almost not working. Caused some weird duplicating of arp responses in the network which took a while(well 30 minutes but still a waste of time) to find. Will never use again even for small business.May be works well on its own or with same vendor."
2,"It did not work for me: I needed a way to connect 2 Ethernet computers and a Wi-Fi router to a modem with 1 Ethernet port, used this device to do it. It turned out when one of the clients had connected to the Internet, the other 2 clients could no longer connect to the Internet. I had to turn off the Internet-connected  client to allow another client to connect to the Internet."
2,War OK
2,mine was defective... I do have friend who swear by this switch but i guess luck of the draw mine did not work and have to send it back.. TP link has comes a long way and these other then mine did not work they amazing items.. BUT i have to give it a lower score cause mine was DOA... aww well
2,"Works okInterface app does not workCustomer support not greatWould not bother with tp again, will use netgear"
2,"good switch for learning, but not very secure"
2,They're still selling the version 1 of hardware. You don't have DSCP and Web-based management. It's really disappointing because v2 is on the market from 2 months ago.
2,"This is one of the worst pieces of technology I've purchased. I've got a competitor's bottom-of-the-range 5-port switch which performs better than this. It has inconsistent performance and my Xbox One hates it - regular disconnections from the Xbox server despite it being configured correctly. Also, I was shipped a model with V1 hardware when there has been a V2 model out for some time. Very, very disappointed, not recommended."
2,"There is an issue with V1 of this product, and TP-Link wont fix it. The utility program that manages the switch wont work with a firewall running. My company enforces this so no option to turn it off. So if you want to manage the switch with a firewall TP_link said you should get the V2"
2,"As soon as I found that you need a Windows executable to set this thing up, it went straight back in the box. The box says it's compatible with Windows, Mac OS and Linux, but it's not, it's Windows-only. You can futz about with the ""executable"" as it seems it's actually written in Java but even then they have written it in a manner that needs a specific version of Java, then they wrapped it in a .exe just to be even stupider. I dumped it and went Netgear instead.  This is 2015, soon to be 2016, not 2002. Give it a browser GUI and don't make it IE6-only!!"
2,This really aggravate me.. I am not sure why but 2 of the buttons are stuck. Came that way out of the package. Not worth the money.
2,"Not consistent. Sometimes it charges, but slowly, and other times, it doesn't charge at all, which is frustrating. We stopped using it. I should've sent it back but life is a little crazy right now and I never got around to it. Ugh!"
2,Stopped working after a few months.
2,Disappointed that it can't do fast charging. It is painfully slow. It now lives in a drawer.
2,It won’t work for my Apple device only my kindle :(
2,"If this is connected to my wife's computer when she boots, it will spin forever. I have a KVM switch for three computers on a dual monitor configuration. When this is plugged into the ""mouse"" port of the KVM, I have real issues booting my three computers - the dual display is confused and one monitor often will not come up.Update: I replaced this one with the one below, and the problems went away.https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014ZQ07NE/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1"
2,"Didn't work out of the package. Two inner ports do not recognize any items plugged into them with or without ""power"" button. One power button on an outer port is stuck ""down"" in the on posiition.  Amazon isn't even requiring me to send it back. They are just refunding my money. The item is going in the trash can."
2,Does not work for Apple chargers.  Wish I had known this before purchasing.  Very disappointed.
2,The switches break over time. They are not tolerant of noisy FTDI serial cables. The cord is too short.
2,Hook up to this and you'll be charging FOREVER. I do not recommend.
2,Even the slightest vibration will trigger the one toggle which is very annoying.
2,"I’m not a big fan of this product. So far I’ve used it 3 times, and I bought it specifically for multiple items to be charged on my computer. However, it only works when my laptop is both open and turned on. It also has a rather short cord and is rather awkward to use. Wouldn’t recommend"
2,"If your Desktop's USB Port(s) are in the front and on the upper part of the Tower... these will ""dangle"" in mid-air and are (1) look extremely messy and disorganized (unless you like having a bunch of black spaghetti hanging in front of your tower; and (2) a real pain in the @$$ to connect anything to them.  I guess they're good for a Laptop and that's about it."
2,"I have pneumatic desk riser and this thing hang off the left edge with my webcam, USB headphones and wireless keyboard dongle plugged in.  if you inadvertantly tap one of the buttons, the accessory shuts off (think:  going mute or losing video during a video call).  It must be intended for another purpose."
2,Doesn't support charging a ps4 controller or other things of that sort
2,"When my Android is on a fast charger it charges at about 2800 mah, regular charger 1200 mah. On this usb I was getting 260 mah charge..."
2,"I purchased this in 2015 and still use it once in a while but I've noticed it disconnects and then reconnects every once in a while. If I have devices connected to it, it gets annoying that I won't be able to use my wireless keyboard and/or mouse until it reconnects. Either it was faulty since I've had it or poor quality, but you could spend a little more on another one such as the Anker multi-USB (which I also have)."
2,Item worked well for about three weeks and then started dropping the connection to the computer. Bought a second one and the issue happened again after a lesser amount of time. i'll find a more reliable unit somewhere else
2,"One by one each leg went bad, only needed two outlets so it took a little while before completely worthless, but wouldn't buy again and certainly wouldn't recommend."
2,"I have both the 3.0 version and this 2.0 version from the same manufacturer.This 2.0 version causes all kinds of interrupt issues when being used while gaming on USB 3.2.Only my headset was on the hub, nothing else and it caused sound to mute, controllers to stop working and would, occasionally, even  cause my mouse to report 'close window' when in Chrome.I went back to the 3.0 and all issues went away.Again, I want to stress that the mouse and controller were not plugged into the 2.0 hub; only my headset."
2,"I purchased this to use with my electronic organizer.  Unfortunately, only one port worked.  I couldn’t use to charge all my two phones and Apple Watch at the same time."
2,"I wish the cord length was longer, also I bought this for my TV but it’s not strong enough to support my roku. I constantly get a message stating the charge isn’t strong enough and it shuts off my show."
2,This item stopped working 2 days after I received it and it was barely used.
2,"Power on, but would not charge anything plugged into it. Very small and poor quality."
2,"It worked fantastically until just now, when it just gave up right before my final. Its a good hub for the price, but don't expect it to last. It started off with my mouse just randomly not giving an output through it then it stopped working all together. I only had 2 usb's plugged in and being used when it gave out and it had operated all 4 usb's previously."
2,charging speed is slow. been using it for one month and a half and it doesn't work well right now.  sometimes it doesn't read the flash disk and my printer doesn't work when connecting to it.
2,One port doesn't work.  I now have a three port hub that seems to work fine.  I guess I could send back but it doesn't seem worth the effort.
2,Ive had this usb extender for my laptop work area and it has been working perfectly up until now. Less than two months later I am having trouble with connection problems and it having issues recognizing my keyboard and mouse. I will not be buying anymore and I will need to replace this with a more reliable one.
2,This product will not charge any Apple products. Disappointed that it was not disclosed before purchasing it.
2,"It charges very, very slowly. I am not pleased at all. I only gave it 2 stars because it does charge it after all, and if you have nothing else, this will work, otherwise, it's a waste of money."
2,My iphone rejects it. Bad purchase
2,Did not like the build quality but it was cheap!
2,"It works well sometimes...sometimes. I have my drawing tablet and a keyboard connected into mine and it’s always randomly disconnecting and reconnecting. It’s a huge pain, and I’ll be buying something a little higher quality now."
2,"Only 2 of the 4 work, and only on specific cords DISAPPOINTED."
2,"2 of its ports doesn't work well, it usually can not recognize my phone.So sad, I already throw it away after using it a few times."
2,3PORTS no waiting. one quit and stuck off.
2,"It works... But dosent, If I try to move the usb splitter it would turn off and turn back on, it gets really annoying because I have an external hard drive hooked up to the usb splitter and my mouse, when ever I see my mouse turn off im like OH BOY, and my external hard drive gets shut down, and I have to reload the game again, this sucks when im playing an online game like cs go or rainbow six"
2,Only charges phones. I just received this and am disappointed based on the reviews. The only thing I can get it to charge are mobile phones. Not my keyboard or ipad.
2,Keeps turning off on meReally not happyCord is to long that attaches to computerReally annoying ....concept is great .... not great for using with a laptop though
2,"I have a keyboard, phone charger and headset plugged in and the headset keeps going out. There is obviously something wrong with this port."
2,When I installed hub it killed my Wi-Fi receiver and one of my printers. Had to remove hub to get back up and running.
2,"This was a waste of money. Its flimsy and cheap. The cord is WAY to short. Maybe 6"". Too short to reach from outlet to table top. You just have to let it dangle there. You get what you pay for."
2,"I have Alexa, fire tablet and my phone charger. This Hub works But will not charge my tablet and phone  or what I mean is it will not start the extra charging. Example if my phone battery is at 23% and I plug it into this hub it will stay at 23%. And I have try changing to each different out port."
2,this power switch takes up to much power to split a charger into four devices. waste of money.
2,Bad connection..
2,It only work once or when i first use it. You can't use all the slot. Waste of money.
2,Product works as described. Downside is that it TRIPLES the charging time of any device plugged into it. My dead phone charges in 1 hr 40 minutes on wall charger. Connect this product and the charge time says 6 hrs 52 minutes. My spotlight usually takes about 4 hours to charge. I hooked it up to this before bed and it was still charging in the morning 8 hours later.
2,I dont like it
2,Very slow or no charging
2,"It did not work at all and sent back would lose me Money, so I put in trash instead and that's where it belong!"
2,"I was pleased with this hub originally, but it went kaput after just a couple months of use. Waste of money."
2,This 4 port USB Hub is not so efficient.  First of all it dangles from the computer causing a hazard.  The ports do not allow the USB's to be plugged in all the way so part of the silver is showing.  Just not user friendly.  However the price was right.
2,This is a very cheap water coming off this hub. It's crazy then there's no way this thing supports true high speed. It works and gets the job done but I wouldn't call a quality by any means. For what I paid go to shop around and done a little better on eBay you just wouldn't have got the two day shipping. I don't like the fact that the USB is fixed to the hub so if you damage its game over
2,Shipping arrived day late.Not everything you connect to this 4 port usb device will work. Example an external hard drive will NOT work. In the onset thought loss all that wad on external device but was able to recover.I've had to adjust how I planned to use this 4 Usb port device. I regret ordering.
2,"Bought this 4 port USB hub in March 2019 primarily to connect a wired keyboard, mouse and printer with my laptop while at work. It worked fine for 3 months Then all of a sudden it would randomly drop connection with my devices. Mouse would stop working then reconnect after a few seconds. Then the keyboard would drop out. All at random.  Really frustrating. I threw it in the trash (not worth the hassle of returning) and bought a USB hub made by a different manufacturer."
2,"I'm surprised this got good reviews, but it could be that they are mixing the ratings between different models. The unpowered units (2) I purchased only worked sometimes. The first one was fine with a wireless mouse USB, an external keyboard USB and ONE brick. The fourth slot on the unit would not operate simultaneously with the third slot. The drives would often make scary noises and disconnect. The second unit also would not operate more than 2 bricks at once. There might be some sort of pass-through limitation, so I would advise folks to try the powered, faster units, although I have not tried them yet myself. Limited functionality gets it two stars; at least it did allow me to transfer my data between bricks although with less convenience than for which I had hoped."
2,Did not like this so much. Only one port works when all 4 are supposed to work.
2,I bought this for a specific reason and it's inconvenient when only works at 75%. Should have spent extra money. You get what you pay for.
2,"This thing is really finicky. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes the buttons on the top turn the USB port on and off, sometimes they do nothing. Sometimes peripherals work with it, sometimes they don't. It's like playing Bingo with your USB peripherals."
3,Doesn't do what it says it does at all
3,Nails still split
3,It does whiten and moisturize.
3,didn't work
3,Product didn’t do as advertised
3,I bought this based on the reviews but I think this is a smelly coconut oil and didn't work as it was supposed to.
3,"After weeks of use,  nails stil chop and break"
3,Hasn't made much of a difference yet but I keep using it
3,did not notice any results
3,Not really sure about this yet.  Its a hard cream.  I expected it to be thinner like a lotion.  Its greasy so you have to wipe your hands off after.I really haven't been using it long enough to give a review on whether or not it works
3,"My nails still split, bend, and tear. I don't use it as often as in the beginning."
3,"Haven't had it long. The smell is overwhelming!  So, I won't use it very often."
3,Used for a couple of months but didn't notice any difference with my nails.
3,Not as effective as I had hoped. A little thin.
3,Helped cuticles but not nails.
3,"It moisturizes, but so far I really can’t see any difference."
3,I didn't notice any difference between this and other nail/hand creams
3,It’s ok. Been using for two months now and my nails are same.
3,Didn’t work
3,Not seen any miracles but still trying after a month.
3,I believe it hardened my fingernails.
3,I can't give a rating yet I just received it and have only used 1 day.
3,It’s ok. But don’t thinkIt helped my nails & I put it on every day
3,It seems to work. The only drawback is the OVERWHELMING coconut smell.
3,Either this takes awhile to work or it doesn't work as much as everyone says it does. My nails are still breaking after 3 weeks...
3,Doesn’t work
3,I gave it 3 out of 5 stars because the instructions say use 3x per day. I don't have time to apply 3x per day. This means I would have to carry it around.
3,I received this gel no white topcoat and it was very clumpy you couldn’t even use And that’s upsetting because I love this product
3,The top coat is fine dries perfectly.The base however does not ever dry fully and so the nail polish peels off After a couple days no despite the top coat.
3,It turns a yellowish color when cured.
3,Not long-lasting
3,It does not dry and it comes right off at the slightest touch
3,Still have to wipe
3,"I don’t know what I’ve been doing wrong, if anything, but the base coat cures in a weird way. It will almost bubble and shrink to one side of my nail. I thought it was my technique or lamp, but I later found out it wasn’t the case. The top coat is pretty solid though, so I’ll keep using that."
3,I cured the base and top coats with a 45W LED Lamp for 60 seconds and they were still sticky + tacky. Even cured them for an additional 30 after that and still sticky. Tried to wipe them off after a while and it just takes the polish off. Very difficult to remove residue as well.
3,"It's more expensive than the one I've used before. Also my nail polish doesn't last, I'm going back to the other one I used. Atleast that one is $2 cheaper and it lasted me 2 weeks."
3,Has a harsh smell other then that it work good
3,You still have to wipe.
3,Doesn’t last as long as other products I’ve used.
3,"Kinda thick, does not last long"
3,"Did not use for 3 months stored in a dark cupboard,  and when I went to use them they were chunky and wouldn't work"
3,Polish is decent but one is obviously old because it arrived dry. Still usable but very dry.
3,It just doesn't leave the same shine as a regular wipe off...
3,Very thick. Takes 4 min to dry on led light
3,To small
3,The listing makes these look very special. Indeed they are attractive (if somewhat smaller than normal). But they don't do any better than the ones you buy at the drugstore.
3,They are very small
3,Difficult to hold and press down with precision. Don't waste your money.
3,"I’ve only used them once, but I was expecting them to be sharper. I wouldn’t spend $15 on these again."
3,I gave this product 3 stars because I felt it  performed exactly the same as a cheap clipper.
3,I was expecting something way different
3,"The edge is sharp and cuts easily. But due to the edge's thickness and higher grind angle, nails can often crack a tiny bit compare to my old Victorinox 8.2055.CB clippers.Ended up using some high grit sandpapers (1000, 2000 and 3000 grit) to sharpen my old clipper and put these in the drawers as emergency backups.Structurally, these are stronger than the Victorinox, and easier to cut some thicker and harder nails (like big toe nail).They works, but are not the best choice for me."
3,Not very sharp and to not come with file
3,"I've bought nail clippers at the usual department stores for years, brands like Revlon, Trim, etc. I was looking to replace a set so I researched the Harperton clippers and other brands. The reviews on this set were very good 4.6 out of 5 stars, over 10, 000 reviews and an Amazon Choice for high ratings and a well priced product. They are well made, sharp and ergonomic, but are not outstanding as some reviews claimed. They are actually a little shorter and slightly wider than the department store brands, but do not seem to cut any better and have no swing out nail file attached to the device. In my opinion, they are no better than the department stores and are more expensive."
3,Too heavy and herky - and more expensive than the set I got for my husband! Returning
3,Just trying it out...like it so far.
3,Smells decent
3,I put some of this on every time I go to the senior center or retirement home. 70% of the time works every time!
3,Na
3,The size of the bottle is too small.
3,To oily and goes away fast the fragrance
3,It doesn't work for me
3,N/a
3,Not a long lasting smell
3,There wasn't much scent at all. who knows if the pheromones' are working?
3,Wanted something spicier
3,It’s cool...I guess for what you pay it is what it is. I didn’t get any compliments and it’s more like an oil in a spray bottle.
3,I can hardly smell it on me
3,Scent and longevity. Oily and leaves mark on clothes.
3,It’s ait
3,See above headIine.
3,I don't know I think it's a normal colong
3,Did not notice a difference
3,"It’s a decent smelling cologne, I don’t think at all it contains pheromones. Unless, it has to do with one’s own body chemistry and how it reacts. Kind of expensive for the size and I would not rebuy."
3,None
3,"I'm in a rural part of the country.... It works I think,but I pair it with Armani"
3,"I don't really use it often because it won't last for long, it's an oil and you need to re-apply. It's also a very light scent people barely smell it"
3,The smell doesn't last long it fades away quick
3,Very normal.
3,Don't work
3,Enough said.
3,Pew
3,"Love the scent, but doesn't last long. Not too sure about the pheromone part. Don't think you can just rub on pheromones."
3,Just Ok. It’s an oil !
3,Normal
3,For the price I would expect longer longevity.
3,Nothing
3,It wasn't what I thinking it was
3,Could not tell any difference when I used it had not effect
3,Very oily when it goes on.
3,FOR EVERYDAY USE
3,"It appears to be just a plain scent, that doesn't really last long...."
3,"The scent isnt that strong, the smell is interesting. Wont buy again. Some people didnt even notice i had it on"
3,Nothing noticeable .. i think its a bit expensive
3,"While the scent is pleasing....at least to me, I’ve used other men’s cologne with more lasting results?"
3,Not what I quite expected but I expect to use it.
3,Subpar longevity
3,Its to oily....
3,The smell did not last
3,"Smells fresh, oily. Couldn’t attract a fly even in a strip club."
3,Smells ok!
3,I believe this stuff but it doesn't work at all. No women will pay special attention to this smell at all
3,Clinique for men is the way to go.
3,My bottle was only 3/4 full when I opened it
3,"The scent of this perfume is light and refreshing.However, the down side is the smell doesn't last for long."
3,It’s okay. Smells slightly better than Axe I suppose. You get what you pay for. It could be worse.
3,What fragrance? None at all.
3,The smell went away
3,Cheap scent as price
3,Leaves spots on my clothes.
3,So when i received the package the entire box was soaked in the cologne. Smells decent.
3,Scent does not last long at all
3,"An average scent, nothing really unique about it"
3,Scent does not last long!
3,Yup
3,its decent but if i put it on my neck i break out
3,It evaporated to quick
3,the scent does not last long but its ok.
3,"I got this product bc these type of scents should last a couple hours, but it barely lasts through the first."
3,it does stays long but the smell does not live up to it's ratings and reviews
3,5 star longevity cause I cant get the smell out. Holy moly dont buy cheap cologne!
3,Cheap scented
3,Perfume is cheap but at the same the fragrance doesn't stay for a long time. Wears off in a couple hours
3,The scent is very light and doesnt linger very long.
3,Excelente producto
3,I’d rather go to bealls instead
3,its decent for the money..
3,I GIVE THIS 5 STARS DOES WHAT IT SAYS
3,These are decent for the price I would say because it doesn’t last that long but smells decent
3,Smell not long
3,"Not saying there is anything wrong with the product. I guess I the kind of person that is use to higher end colognes. I just wanted to get something for my grudge days(I always have to wear something).It's not a  bad cologne, but just not my taste. It's subtle and wears evenly. I am aware that there are different scents, so I might need to try a different one."
3,"Has a light, powdery scent"
3,The smell doesn’t last long. 🤨
3,Scent does not last more than an hour or so. Will not order again.
3,Not enough vanilla scent !
3,Overly vanilla for me
3,Smells clean......but fades too fast.
3,"Not a very ""woodsy"" ""Oaky"" aroma, very lite scent doesnt last long, but alot of cologne for $20."
3,Just ok.
3,Smells cheap
3,The smell just isn't there. Not manly at all.
3,Not Expecting for the Price ?
3,Fragrance doesn’t last long enough!
3,Gives me a headache
3,—-
3,Good stuff. The bottle is garbage though. Which makes it all trash. If it cant handle the shipping or it falling over once. It’s no good. The qc for the cap is trash.
3,"I anticipated this dryer to be just what I was looking for but it was twice too large & heavy for my hands. I’m so disappointed because in the few areas my hands could manipulate it, my hair did just what I had hoped it would do. If you make one that does, please let me know because I’m at my wits end."
3,Bought in July and already smells like it’s on fire when using.  A week outside the return window 🙄
3,Too bulky to hold
3,Long and heavy to use.
3,NOTHING
3,The dryer cylinder was too big for what I intended to use it for. It was rather hot to hold and just didn’t work for me.
3,"Too loud. Didn't curl my hair, just blew it all around."
3,It is too large to use on shorter to medium length hair.
3,Not really for people with long thick hair.
3,My hair sits on mu shoulders and I have bangs.  The brush is too big for my bangs.  I had to return it.
3,Didn't like it; heavy and too bulky for anything other than long hair.  I returned this item.  other than that it appears to dry and curl ok but not for me.
3,Wasn't expecting it to be so big. Kinda bulky and heavy.
3,It does dry quickly.
3,It did dry my hair fast but my hair didn't look as smooth and shiny as I expected.
3,normal
3,Not many temparature control settings
3,Too big and heavy
3,Too bulky to use
3,"It is very heavy , I gave it to my Grandaughter"
3,Too heavy to use all over head. Have only used once since buying it.
3,Doesn’t really wave the way you’d imagine
3,It’s biggest strength is smoothing hair. It doesn’t give great volume and it gets very hot.
3,na mal
3,I should have researched this more. The size of the head is way too big for my shoulder length hair.
3,The handle is too large abd it makes unit heavy and Gard for me to turn
3,Big and very heavy.
3,"I have loved this dryer and have been raving about it and have gotten several of my friends to buy it.  It works for me because I’m not coordinated enough to manage the brush and dryer separately.  That said, I’ve had it for 10 months and it suddenly broke on me last night.  I was so sad.  Revlon is doing a warranty replacement but I don’t get to pick my color.  That may seem trivial but I just want what I bought to work and I think if it breaks then they should replace it with the same thing.  I’m definitely not happy with that warranty policy.  Obviously it matters enough to me that I have come back here to update the review so that says something.  And the whole thing makes me question how long this one will work too."
3,Did not dry my thick hair at all! Took longer then a hairdryer
3,"I think it works ok, its meant for air dried hair I think. It takes FOREVER to dry wet hair. It would take an hour to get hair dry using this."
3,Could have been smaller.
3,"There’s a tiny lip at the top that my hair get caught under and tangles or rips out. Drying my hair takes much longer and there isn’t much curl, like I expected. Decent product but it just doesn’t do what I thought it would."
3,If you have long hair you will need to blow dry with regular dryer a little before using it or it will take forever to dry your hair.
3,No temperature adjustment and it gets soooo hot. I wish I would have bought a better one and spent more money on something that doesn’t get this hot. I would not recommend.  It works great but the heat cannot be good for your hair.
3,Gets too hot!!! A bit clumsy.
3,Ordered a bunch for Christmas presents only had one that didn’t work!
3,"Very loud, heavy and the unit gets too hot."
3,I like that my hair doesn’t get stuck in it. You can keep turning the brush without your hair falling out of it. I don’t like that it doesn’t dry my roots so my hair will be dry but not the top of my head
3,After 5mos of use the dryer now makes a high pitch skreeching noise for the 1st minute after turning on.
3,"After a couple times using,  it made hair feel heavy."
3,Didn’t do what it said
3,Didn’t see ANY sort of change in my hair!!!
3,Smell is ok. I have been using this for 2 months and haven’t seen much difference in my hair. Smell doesn’t stick.
3,When I use this..my hair became very strong..but getting lot of dandruff
3,Makes my scalp itch
3,Can't really tell this makes any sort of difference what so ever.
3,Caspa
3,Wasn’t quite what I expected
3,The shampoo and conditioner work like they say. I am picky when it comes to how my hair feels after washing. I really dislike my hair being staticky. I want my hair soft and not full of static. I guess it depends on what you are after. For the price I myself will try something else.
3,It makes my hair knottyFeels dryer now than before.
3,It was kinda stringy
3,It's OK.  If course going to use for longer than 2 days
3,Hair felt dry
3,Didn’t work not even a little
3,It was ok. Didn’t notice anything different from my usual shampoo. Set time is a bit to long. 5minutes for shampoo is do able 10-15 for conditioner is way to long for in the shower.
3,I will not purchase again
3,Not seeing a big difference in my hair. Have been using 3 months.
3,The conditioner doesn't soften my hair.  I do believe that the shampoo has a stripping effect.  I do not notice my hair being any shiner.
3,"It really help me with my eczema problem, my scalp is not as itchy and I see way less dry  scalp on my head, thw only thing I dont like its that the rest of my hair gets way dry and tangled, even with the conditioner."
3,Left my hair with a lot of tangles
3,It’s breaking my hair in half. Bummed:
3,It's not what I expected. It tangles my hair up to much.
3,I started using this but it doesn’t seem to meet up to its claims.
3,It makes my hair feel dry
3,Was expecting lager bottles
3,Feels to weighted on my hair. Like I have to really rinse to get it out of my hair. Not at all impressed. Would not buy again.
3,"It's too thick, I had to wash my hair multiple times to get product out. This product is not for African American hair."
3,Not for consumption
3,It really is quite thick.
3,Takes time. We need more time to review
3,It’s really heavy so use it very sparingly. I have thick hair and it’s even weighs my hair down.
3,Way too sticky.
3,I mostly used it on a section on my eyebrows that look thin. Used this every night and I'd say that It worked. Hair looks thicker now.
3,My husband only used the castor oil once.  We haven't use it enough to evaluate it yet.
3,Have not seen any result
3,Haven’t really noticed any difference. Been putting it on for about 2 months now...
3,"This is way too thick for hair applications. It's hard to rinse out even with shampoo and it leaves your hair feeling sticky and muddy which makes hair difficult to comb or brush afterwards. I haven't seen any positive effects of using this stuff and I will say for the most part it made my hair feel worse not to mention gave it massive shrinkage.I gave it 3 stars however because if you mix it in with conditioner it's a way better experience. It's good as a base to mix with other products but It is however not the reason I purchased this. I purchased it with the intention of only using this oil by itself. I don't see how this can be beneficial if it makes my hair feel yucky.I may continue experimenting with it as a base as I try to mixtures of other oils to come up with a proper consistency but based on the advertisement of using this for ""hair"" or it's mystic ""hair health"" properties I""m going to have to say this is a a bit far fetched to expect from this item and not a good reason to purchase it."
3,I found it cheaper at the local supercenter.
3,"The texture is very tick. Didn’t see the result yet , though I’m using it since a week"
3,Not sure if it worked or not. It is difficult to spread on because it has the texture of tree sap.
3,It didn’t moisturize my skin and the bottle kept leaking every where so I had to throw it away
3,Everybody needs It’s
3,WOULD NOT BUT.AND DON'T USE ON HAIR
3,It does work somehow!
3,Arrived licking and almost half is gone.
3,It didn’t do anything
3,Does the job
3,Just started using the product so I can't give an accurate review.
3,To tick for my...hard to wash off.
3,I’ve been using it on my hair for about 2 months now but nothing noticeable yet.
3,Does not last all day
3,"Doesn’t stay long, started to fade within 3 hours of apply."
3,"Not smudge proof, spreads across my eyes by the end of the day."
3,It works just not as long as it states.
3,It runs after 2hours in a humid climate
3,I don’t see what all the hype is about.
3,"Little water resistance.  Very smooth color ( brown), but is hypoallergenic."
3,Just a regular eyeliner
3,A little light and patchy gunks up if you go over spots again and dries down shiny
3,This product is drying out to fast.
3,It’s ok. Prefer Stila.
3,It’s not 24 hrs stay
3,Smudges.
3,Average.
3,Not very water resistant & have to go over several times to get the black dark enough. Prob won't purchase again.
3,hairs on the brush bent out of place
3,It is not waterproof and doesn’t last long.  I had to use it several times to fix the eyeliner. I wouldn't buy it again!
3,For the price it’s ok... I wear contacts... I have to se another..
3,Eh it's too watery
3,"This eyeliner is waterproof in a way that if you put it on and try to wipe it off with water it will only partially come off, but it IS NOT waterproof in a way that you can go swimming or sweat even a little bit. I bought it for my vacation because the reviews were good and it actually says ""waterproof"" not ""water resistant"" which is what it really is. Also the brush/marker is too flexible making it very difficult to do winged eyeliner. I would not recommend this eyeliner at all"
3,It’s not waterproof or smudge proof.
3,Product just ran when I tried outlining my eyes
3,I am on Airplanes all the time and the tube explodes and leaks
3,"I am not sure what is up with this brand. I bought one it was fine, bought another and fibers started popping out. Just got two more and one of them is doing it already?"
3,goes on smoothly lasts for hours
3,I’ve had the product for a short time and it’s already coming apart and it smudges alot
3,Cracked after awhile
3,The line was thinner than I thought it would be...
3,Dried out really quickly
3,Read a ton of reviews.  Got this to replace my MAC liquid last eyeliner.  It doesn’t last as others have reviewed.  I use a primer & setting spray and it still fades away by the end of the day. Doesn’t last on oily skin.
3,not bad.definitely not waterproof though. got faded after 4 hours too
3,The product was kind of dry and was not waterproof! Will prob not purchase again!
3,Tip of the eyeliner started fraying and was not smooth and pointy. It was all over the place
3,It started flaking.
3,It tries but doesn't work for hooded eyes. May work for those without hooded eyes but for me it smudged like crazy.
3,"Its not waterproof, smears  and does not stay on all day"
3,Blush is good but the smell was terrible like putting selfless tanner
3,It's okay....it does the job but the color is a bit orange. I wouldn't return it but I will not buy it again.
3,This product is okay . It smells nice but it doesn’t really show well on my skin type . I prefer the hoola bronzer .
3,I don’t smell anything. Wanted as a contour. Too orangey!!!!
3,It doesn't taste the same as last time
3,Product came without applicator inside
3,Not dark enough. Plus it smelled funny. Sadly I'm returning .
3,Made my pores look bigger
3,Little too light
3,It came brokeeeeeee !!! So dissapointed!
3,Really have to use a lot to show color
3,The color is too light for my skin.  I cannot see it.
3,The bronzer is very light for my skin tone. This bronzer is for light people. I am more on the brownish skin color.
3,Side by side my “bronzer” and “deep bronzer” are the same color... should have just kept it I guess
3,It was a lot more shimmery than I thought it would be. I ended up returning it.
3,Waaaaay too dark and almost the same as the darker shade.
3,ça va
3,"The product seems to cover ok, when you can get it to come out of the tip. There is a dial you turn and then you're supposed to tap the sponge applicator on your skin, but barely any of the product comes out.  Also, removing the seal around the cap left a very sticky residue on the bottle that I couldn't get off even with rubbing alcohol."
3,not much coverage
3,Too thick and water repellent
3,Not enough coverage
3,"The product works as expected for a concealer. However, instant age repair is a big stretch. The spongy applicator seemed to make the distribution of the concealer uneven. Used it, but won’t purchase again."
3,Like it but found it hard to get out.
3,It doesn't work for me at all.
3,Powder spread
3,Don't feel I would reorder.
3,"The concealer accentuated some of my texture and creases under the eye. I have sunken eyes. Not sure if I will use again. Also the applicator seems unhygienic. I know the products has many rave reviews though, my skin is just not good enough to have a flawless application of this concealer."
3,ditto
3,"Loved it, that is until it stopped turning to dispense more. I guess I'll have to break out open to use it"
3,Maybe I should've chosen a different shade? It just didn't 'stay in place' to change the color of my 'dark circles?'
3,I have a lot of dark spots and I can not completely cover them.  But I'm old and maybe don't know what I'm foing
3,Product seemed somewhat dried out- not easy to blend/spread. Flaked off easily after application.
3,I always use this brand but after removing the tape that seals it a sticky residue was left.
3,Does just an average job for coverage.  Has a tendency to crease and wear off mid-day
3,VERY drying
3,dry
3,I have been using this product for quite some time (2 years or more) and I gave it only a three star to make a statement that it is NOT going to cover up age spots or blemishes. I use it as a ''base'' before putting on my liquid makeup.
3,Much lighter than actual color displayed.
3,Its not thick enough
3,Feels and looks really thin for dark circles. Imperfections on skin dies cover up.
3,"It's ok, not moisturizing at all."
3,Dont know why but it doesnt come out ...
3,Not sharp enough. One use does it in.
3,These are not sharp...at all.
3,Not my favorite razor for facial skin. These don't move over skin very well. Maybe I need to get used to using the we m.
3,"Good beginner tool to start with if you're new to derma planing. It's good for the price. However, I think that it gets the job done but not as good as you want it to with dead skin. It is great at removing that peach fuzz around the jawline though."
3,Not sharp enough
3,Not so smooth and not so much for sensitive skin
3,"This product works as described for me, but really scratched up my sister who has sensitive skin."
3,Not that sharp.Plastic edges scratched my face.
3,They work
3,I have noticed this pulls hair a little instead of just shaving smoothly off.
3,It works but I don’t see how it works any different than a razor!
3,They are sharp but I feel they should be shorter or maybe a different shape. I find it to be big for the areas on my face.
3,"The pump is sturdy and reliable. However, the container is top-heavy."
3,Not sharp enough. Not at all moisturizing. I had to go over several times the areas I needed done. Cheap enough that I didn’t return.
3,I didnt like that it was hard to maneuver around my eyebrows. It left my skin a little irritated because there is just a blade.  I did like that it came in a 3 pack. I liked the price.
3,These are ok! I bought temporarily because I can’t get my eye brows waxed right now and they needed shaping.
3,My face is still sensitive after using. It got the hair off but didn’t really exfoliate. My face is raw.
3,"The blades will easily cut you. They are very irritating on delicate skin. But it works well,so be careful when you use it."
3,"Product is easy to use and helps my skin to look great. Would give 5 stars, but one of the three razors arrived broken."
3,I really nicked myself with these.  I don't with other brands.
3,These are ok. They do the job but do not last.
3,For face use only. Don’t use these on the coochie.
3,V.denger
3,Wasn’t what I expected
3,"The product seemed a little cheap in my experience with it, however it still did what I wanted I just only got one or 2 uses out of each blade."
3,This is my second and doesn’t work as good as the original.
3,Heats up after a short time.
3,"I'm going to keep it, but it still left enough behind that I still had to use tweezers."
3,Hair comes back a few days later
3,Worked one time
3,this was purchased for Mom
3,However…. It doesn’t really work!!! Don’t buy!
3,The product simply quit working despite a new battery.
3,It takes some work to actually remove the hair. I have to go over my face a couple of times to really see results.
3,it did not work
3,"So it works for the most part, misses some hairs here and there, but I mean its way easier than a razor  and you can safely travel with it. Problem is I have severely sensitive skin and it did make me break out, so overall I won’t be using it very much."
3,"OK, but anything to write home about."
3,Leaves visible stubble for darker hair
3,"This seemed to dull really quickly and I do have to go over the same spot a lot.  Although when I clean it there is always a ton of baby hairs, so it has to be working. It just has a harder time on course hair."
3,Do not waste your moneyIt is not what it says it isYou use it to cut off hair which it does but it grows right back in two daysIt says the hairs stay away for a week or two but that is false
3,It’s ok. Have to use it 3 times a day. Makes hair grow back fast  Not very smooth.
3,Loved this product a lot but it has recently stopped working despite new batteries. Purchased less than a year ago
3,Chin up
3,Need to got over a few times before it actually works
3,Was not what I expected.
3,"it does the job but it will stop on you, it doesn't work steady it gets caught on the hair and stings, overall it does the job you just have to be patient with it, battery is tricky you think your battery is running out all the time, for the price its good enough"
3,Not for everyone. The sharpest go away essay.
3,"I can't figure out why this works on some hairs and areas and not others. I had some dark hairs removed and some that it skipped over many times. Same with light hairs. I needed several passes to get most of the hairs that it was able to get and others I had to just use something else to remove. It was very gentle on my skin at least. The battery life seemed ok but I have no idea if it's working at full capacity or not? If your skin is so sensitive that you can't use anything else, maybe try this. Otherwise I would maybe pass on it."
3,"This is basically a shaver, and does not give a very close shave."
3,"Does not take off the hairs,  after using it, stil able to pluck off single hairs."
3,"Used it for my chin. It worked. But 2 days later, there alot was stubble."
3,"It was great while it lasted. (About a month) It slipped from my hand and fell into my sink. From that point on, it seemed to work, it sounded and vibrated like it worked but didn’t.  So I’d say it’s worth the money as long as you aren’t prone to dropping things. Once you drop it, it’s broken."
3,Didn’t really get the hair as it claims .
3,"Maybe I do not have enough facial hair, but it seemed like I had to leave on my face longer than the demo videos I found. Somewhat worked but I still can see some hairs, waxing ends up being better/faster in my opinion. The only downside is its more painful to wax. Glad this was not too expensive, will use it but will still be waxing when I can."
3,Does not remove hair
3,Works but cheaply made. I dropped it and it feel apart.
3,Works OK.
3,Burns your skin doesn't work
3,Smell
3,Did the job but was STINKYYYYY
3,"It worked only ok. I had to open up windows, light candles, turn on the vent in an attempt to get rid of the smell. I just left that side of the house for a while. It lingered for so long. I will not be doing that again."
3,"Pros:Smooth skin, hair removed, and no burning sensation.Affordable.Cons:Sulfur from the pits of hell have invaded your bathroom - this smell is like a trash bag full of rotten eggs bursting onto the floor - and likely your whole house; it permeates for hours and lingers in your nose canals. It has a god awful smell, but it works.Otherwise:I prefer veet, it's more expensive, but the smell is subtle in comparison; instead it has a slight chemical smell which is nothing compared to the overpowering sulfur smell.Not for everyone, but if you can stand the smell, then it'll save you some money."
3,"If you have thick, course hair, then it doesn’t work as well. I left it on over the time amount recommended and it still did I not take off the hair on my legs."
3,Can't really get past the smell. Also it burns if you have sensitive skin.
3,See above. Use for facial moisturizer.
3,I feel some burning when applying salicylic acid beforehand.
3,It was not as expected. It is very watery and does not moisturize.
3,My product didn't come sealed shut. How do I know it wasn't used?
3,It was ok. Not as motorizing as I thought!
3,An average moisturizer.
3,If I didn't open the product I would have sent it back
3,It not have a seal on it when I opened it it looked used
3,"At first this felt a little sticky on my skin, then after 3 days, my skin seemed extremely dry!It doesn’t work for me. Not for every day use in my opinion."
3,Not as much moisture as I thought!
3,I bought it in April 2021 and it expires in July 2021 ...
3,Made me break out more
3,"for my skin, It's not as moisturizing as described"
3,Moisture did not last long. Skin was very dry after it dried up. The scent was a little much I wasn’t aware it had a scent that’s on me. Umm smooth Nd light
3,"The product seems to be really thin, and left my skin sort of dry and a little sticky. Could be better formulated in my opinion. Guess I’ll stick with Cerave"
3,Product was not sealed!!!
3,I’ve used this for about 30 days and haven’t noticed any difference. May e it’s just me.
3,"Bought this product in July, no scent, used it all, and loved it. Recently I bought another however now it has a scent? It’s the same exact product which is strange. Not a fan of the scent."
3,It burns my skin n it has to many chemicals
3,I will never order another product that uses so much disposable plastic that has so little product. Cone on people!
3,"Item seems correct, but is from another country- I cant read  the labels or confirm authenticity."
3,"The box came kinda beat up, the shrink wrap was ripped and the lid wasn't closed tightly. Possibly a return?But I looked at unboxing videos and saw that there wasn't a paper/plastic lining to seal the opening of the jar and it looked the correct quantity."
3,Dried my skin out
3,Why is it called a moisturizer ? My skin does not feel it . It gets dried up fast and then i need to put more on !
3,It makes my skin soft but it burns.
3,I did not receive what I was expecting. This product has fragrance in it.
3,Only gave 3 stars as when i had recieved this the lid wasnt on right so half of it was in the box and unusable
3,I can't really tell any difference
3,Skin still feels too dry after application. Not that moisturizing.
3,This gel formed clot. Wasn’t very smooth for my skin.
3,"I dont see any results, even after 2 months"
3,Didn't do anything but stain clothes and cause acne
3,Actually I don’t see any thing different on my skin. I have use it for many years
3,Waiting to see results
3,"It was an okay product, I used it nightly. Didn’t cause a reaction which is great, but also didn’t necessarily improve my skin in any way."
3,Different color/smell than Walmart bought bottle.
3,It hasn’t helped prevent stretch marks during my pregnancy
3,I have been using this product on my belly area for stretch marks since I was pregnant and now I felt a little bit different than the one I used to use.
3,I wanted to like this product but the scent is just gross. Like an old woman's perfume. Used it for a week and switched to Dove.
3,"used it for 2 months , don't see much of a difference"
3,First time trying it
3,Still got stretch marksUsed it everyday
3,I haven’t noticed any change in appearance of three different scars I have (two on knees and one on arm)
3,"I used this for months and I do not think it made a difference in any of my stretch marks or scars. Keep in mind they are all barely noticeable as is, but i really thought that since they were so light there would be a drastic difference. I don't know if i would buy this again. I also did not enjoy the smell - its weird and strong"
3,I have been using it for my leg scars and haven’t really seen a difference. I’ve been using the product for a month
3,I used this product while pregnant and still got stretch marks. I used it twice a day and felt moisturized but still got some stretch marks.
3,This is not the real bio oil.
3,"I have yet to notice any difference on my stretch marks, been using everyday morning and night for about 2 months"
3,It seems to break me out a little.
3,Returned
3,It might cause allergy
3,Still waiting for final three months of use to provide full detailed review.
3,Not have used it much
3,Still waiting for results.
3,The product box seal was already ripped open when I recieved it. Other than that the wrap on the bottle itself was still on
3,"I don’t know if it’s actually diminishing my stretch marks, but it feels very luxurious."
3,I don’t see a change yet and have been using a few times a week and putting on with socks and sleeping with them...
3,Need to use them for couple days to see results and not working on all acnes.
3,"For pimples,etc"
3,Acne Pimple Patch does not cure face Pimple after using it.
3,I have used the product only for 2 days and don’t have enough time/usage to rate it.
3,Didn't work as expected.
3,Didn't work for me
3,"Not the earth shattering product I expected. It works well for some things. A pimple beneath the skin - it will usually bring it to the surface. It did not do much for white heads or blackheads. Very limited use, in my opinion"
3,"It helped a little. If you get pimples every once in awhile I can see purchasing them, but if it’s more than that, I don’t see why."
3,As I have sensitive skin this acne pimple product did not work for me
3,Some worked but most of the time they didn’t do anything. I’d suggest a different brand
3,I wore many acne patches before but these don’t seem to do much. They really dry out my acne and if you wear make up then you’ll have a lot of dry patches on your skin.
3,Used it on acne in different areas.  It did not work at all.  I also found the same product at our local Dollar Tree.
3,"It didn’t work for me didn’t do anything for my acne, may have just not worked for me but may work for someone else"
3,Worked as needed
3,Didn’t work out for my skin.
3,The product worked to cover the zit but minimal absorption
3,"Feels small and flimsy..... doesn't slide well.....and ""right clicks"" in the middle of it all...."
3,I need to take my mouse around with me for work and it’s an auto shut off. It ends up staying on in my bag for a long time. I’m just going to use it at home.
3,Didn't look the same as in the picture.
3,It will do for what I need to do
3,I thought it would be more flat.Good price
3,I bought 4 of these mice.  One malfunctioned 1 week after the return date expired.
3,Lasted a few months then it became useless. You get what you pay for.. price wise.
3,Much smaller than I thought it would be
3,Does not have on and off button
3,Cant find the off switch and have burned through multiple batteries.
3,I wanted something pink but this was a bit toyish for me.
3,Bigger then expected. Very light in weight
3,does the job
3,The scrolling is eradicate
3,Did not connect to my windows laptop but works with my sons. I didn’t have the time to figure out why I wouldn’t work.
3,"When not in use for a while, it doesn’t “wake up” very quickly."
3,works.
3,The middle roller doesn’t scroll the page up or down
3,I needed an adapter - mouse is not readily made for Apple devices.
3,Does not have a on/off switch
3,The mouse is quiet - clicks and scroll - but the accuracy is a bit lacking (which is expected for a device of this price).  My only pet peeves (aside from the accuracy) is that it goes into auto-sleep mode when not in use (I prefer to have a on/off button) and the plastic battery compartment opening piece is slightly loosely fitted so it makes some noises whenever you move your mouse.
3,You need batteries for this.
3,The mouse moved too slow.
3,Basic mouse. Nothing fancy about it.
3,Works but cheap looking.
3,The mouse pointer moves uncontrollablely.
3,"I like the quiet click, but it doesn't have an on/off button. And, sometimes it is hard to get it to click on something especially after it hasn't been used for an hour or so."
3,"it works as a mouse, but it cannot be turned off without manually taking out the battery."
3,"Apparently it is for ""lefties"".  I have to do all functions backwards, left clicks are right clicks and vice versa."
3,Gets the job done considering I don’t need it much but feels very cheaply made. I’ve only had mine for about a week so we will see how long it will last.
3,Quieter then my regular mouse but not completely silent.
3,"It does not have an on/off switch. I tried letting it sit & close the computer, but the mouse stayed on. You have to remove the battery each time"
3,It works. Cheaply made but for a cheap price
3,The little cap on the thing u plug into the computer fell off so it reviled the chip card thing and it never worked again and we had this for only two weeks.
3,Decided on wireless
3,This product does not work with my IOS devices.
3,"The mouse kept messing up on me.  After 3 months, I had to replace it.  I will not buy this name brand again."
3,Got this for my sons Chromebook and it is often glitchy.
3,Cheaply made - uncomfortable fit
3,These are way bigger on the face than I excepted . My face looks so tiny with these on.
3,Little cheap look
3,I am sensitive to light and easily get headaches/migraines. These did not improve that for me and I can't tell that they are actually anti-glare or not.
3,Watching tv at night and computer work at night
3,Light weight
3,they’re smudged and the smudges won’t come off
3,I didn’t notice a difference even with the blue light testing tool that they sent with it ..I may use these frames for my real glasses
3,"Sleep quality? Why is that a review category?Otherwise, I don't see/feel a difference wearing these. Also they a little tight on my face"
3,"Bought it cheap, and it look cheap but works for what it suppose to do."
3,I couldn't wear them for long periods of time.
3,The product didn’t do what it said it would do
3,One of my pairs are really loose. One sides won't stay sturdy and I never had any damage to them.
3,I just don’t notice a difference when I wear these glasses.  They seem very lightweight and cheap.
3,"They do what they say, I just personally can't stand the look of them."
3,It was more of just a fashion item
3,I don't find that it gives me much glare protection.
3,"If you have a narrow face, these are huge.Super cute-just entirely too big for my face."
3,I put the test paper up to my computer screen and it never changed the paper to that purple color. I guess my screens are already equipped with the blocker and I didn't need to buy these glasses after all.
3,Can't really tell if it's making any difference
3,Too heavy continuously wearing it.
3,Nothing else to say
3,The mouse often just moves by itself.
3,"Not nearly enough RAM, slows up with just basic web browsing"
3,"Laptop is decent, I’ve had it for just under a year and the mouse doesn’t work"
3,"It’s ok, it crashed chrome as soon as I downloaded it"
3,"This is really great laptop but by design it is meant to slow down performance when on battery power which is normal for many laptops, however either Acer or AMD makes it WAY too slow for that and unlike some laptops there is no setting provided that allows you to change this."
3,it is a cheaper computer that does its job.But the mouse pad thing doesn't work anymore. so I have to use a external mouse
3,Returned laptop. The baccklit keyboard keeps turning off. Droveme nutz
3,Within 6 months of purchase the monitors hinge has pulled away from the screen.
3,"I actually like this computer. It's lite, fast enough to meet my needs, and the touchpad works as well as a Macbook.The reason I'm only giving it 3 stars is due to the fact there is no CAP lock indication of any kind. No light on the key itself, nothing on the screen, no warning when you start to enter a password that the cap are on, nothing.I'm sick of entering password incorrectly because I don't know if the caps are locked on. This may not be an issue for some, so if it isn't go ahead and purchase this one. However, I would caution you that it really is a pain and with almost everything you do being online and all the different requirements for password from simple to complex, it really is quite cumbersome."
3,Bought this and had a question about the computer was told it was out of warranty. How can that be?  Three day warranty what the heck. I would look elsewhere for a computer.
3,Charging cord is shot and I haven’t been had it 3 months.
3,Overheats
3,It will not stay connected to WiFi - I constantly have to reconnect to wifi even after just a few minutes of inactivity.
3,built in camera and mic not working
3,"This is a very basic computer, it really shouldn't be used for streaming or gaming, because it just frankly cannot keep up. And now my touch pad doesn't work so I have to contact ACER to have them fix it. I haven't even had the computer a year yet."
3,"The batter life is trash, and heats up fast"
3,Battery time is about 1.5 hrs
3,Bought it in June now August and is already slow to load and I haven’t even downloaded anything to it
3,Nothing fancy but does what I need.
3,Slowww.
3,I live everything about it except the battery lifeI constantly has to recharge it to appoint i just kept it plugged most of the time
3,Chrome OS doesn’t work for many software apps etc.  could not connect to many programs. Going back to a PC. Probably works for kids but not for “grown up “ who needs more than YouTube or social media.
3,"Was to small for what I wanted it for, returned and got a bigger one."
3,Great buy - we needed a Laptop for simple projects.We both found the computer NOT user friendly - not good for the our senior environment.Still learning.
3,Screen was smaller then I expected. Touch pad not touch screen !!!!!!
3,I need a book that explains to me how to use it!
3,"False advertising in reference to the backlit keyboard. It does NOT have that. Speakers are not loud at all so if you dont have headphones or a quiet space, it can be inconvenient.Good for the basic computer needs."
3,"Functional laptop, but not as described."
3,What I expected
3,THE PROCESSOR IS NOT 2.8GHZ IT IS ONLT 1.3-1.4 GHZ IT IS SLOW.....
3,"Works good.But the keyboard is not backlit.Good buy, if you don't need a backlit keyboard."
3,"its to long for touch screen to recognize touch... needs bluetooth mouse or keyboard for instant reaction, unless it can be reprogrammed for sensitivity,  would be 5 star all around, nerve wrecking.."
3,"I can’t install apps for my LG home appliances even though they are available for Samsung Phones, but not the tablet."
3,"It keeps taking me to other places, puts spaces between letters, jumps around, etc. Returning."
3,What do I do the screen  cracked inside
3,"So far, not impressed...tablet has updated at least 3 times since I received it less than 24 hours ago."
3,"Very slow, press an app and go make a cocktail. By the time you return it will most likely have loaded."
3,"This is my second Galaxy and I found this one to be alot slower, the screen is not nearly as sensitive to touch and the color and screen quality are not the same. I got this one because my first one wouldn't charge after 14 months but I have terrible luck with electronics anyway."
3,It is slow
3,Unless you are only looking to do some light internet browsing and document preparation I suggest that you get something other than a chromebook.
3,Cant really do much with this... if you only need to use the internet then that works.... cant download anything.
3,Too small
3,"This product is not 2.64lbs, it is 2.9lbs"
3,Very sensitive a pad. Impossible to use. Have to get the mouse to work with this laptop...
3,Like the touch screen except for scrollingCame with ZERO instructions.  Which did not make it easy.
3,After 6 Months some keys are not working. I am searching on Amazon to see if there are any replacements sold but I cant find any. I don't see any where I can connect to the manufacturer to buy a replacement. Also there is a glitchy look when watching movies from Netflix. I don't have that issue when I am watching the same movie on my phone which is a low end ZTE. That means that the quality sucks when watching netflix. I don't know how to fix that. Another issue which I have noted is that after the first two months the response time for turn on has slowed significantly. So normally when I open the Chromebook its takes about a second to come on but now it take like 20 seconds to power on. Apart from those three issues (which are somewhat major) the Chromebook seems to work fine.
3,I  do not recommend this chromebook. sometimes it works as it should other times it does not. The front size is smalland when you increase the size then it runs off the page.  I am going to go back to an HP product.This is just to unreliable.
3,Its kinda wack its just a tablet with a key pad
3,Was fast at first. Two months later it’s slowing down a lot.
3,I have to learn too many new things in operating this system.
3,Slow and far away from being a laptop!
3,This is my first Chromebook....I found the screen too smallIt does simple simple to navigate
3,"I absolutely love my surface pro 7, but its been a year an a half since I've bough it and the battery doesn't last more than three hours (on battery saver mode). For me, this is a problem because I move around a lot and it gets very annoying having to carry the charger everywhere I go. Part of the reason I decided to go with the surface was because of its portability and ""long lasting"" battery. If it wasn't for this issue id be giving it a five star review because of its amazing performance, but sadly, this is not the case."
3,Flash drive is not read when connected using usb c. It works when I use a usb c adapter with usb.
3,very small size and high storage but there is not click to lock in the usb slider so when inserting into a computer the usb a or c port will often retract back into the drive instead of going into the female end
3,Does not work if u have a case on your phone.
3,Needs a key ring.
3,Made for windows only
3,I have to take the case off my phone to use it.  It should have a smaller profile so it works with a case on the phone. Also it gets hot.  Why?
3,this USB gets hot after transfer 3-4 video files
3,It gets really hot when in use.
3,Its little flimsy. Actually mobiles that have usb c comes with an adapter themselves and kinda make this product redundant.
3,The only downfall to this is the hole to clip to is right in the center so it is not streamline as it hangs on my keychain.
3,5GB write 60MB/s with 3.1 Type-C.Type-A? ∱∪ↅϏ..
3,feels cheap and overheats all the time
3,write speed is 20mb/s maximum
3,The second one I purchased is marked 64GB but it is only 32 GB. It is marked 64 GB.
3,"Little expensive compared to other metal/rugged ones in Cost/GB. Bought regardless because it had Type-C connector. Its a average flash drive, as connectors look and feel little flimsy as if it would fall apart soon."
3,"most of the time. Frequently has issues with the standard USB side, but none on he USB-C side, which I use more frequently."
3,"I like this flash with the added USB-C port.  It is perfect for moving data between the kids' Macs and other PCs.  Unfortunately the material/workmanship is cheap.  The slider used to extend the connector fails regularly.  Once snapped into place, it will fail and the exposed connector will collapse when inserting into the receiving USB port.  So you must hold the the slider while inserting--a minor annoyance.  The entire flash drive feels a little cheap--not bad but not what I was expecting from SanDisk.  Otherwise, the drive functions well is is a fair deal."
3,Decent product does wat it is intended to do
3,Feels cheap
3,Considerably slower than the 32gb version I already owned.  Not sure if it is due to increased capacity or not.
3,A 3 star because it has a very small & impossible  space to attach to your key ring
3,Decent for the price
3,The drive works as a transfer between my laptop and phone. My big issue is I need to remove the phone case to insert the drive into the phone.
3,"It is made really flimsy, and it does not stay in when it is placed in USB port.  Not what I expected from San Disk."
3,the switch know is not that smooth
3,Not much speed W\R
3,This device is heating very fast
3,Gets Heated
3,Storage capacity is less than whats written on it.It gets heatedup while transferring files
3,Very slow....I didn't expected this one...While copying 1gb file it's taking a lot of time in mobile.....
3,Gets really hot when in use. Starts a transfer quickly but gets slower and slower throughout
3,Practico
3,Transfer speed is veey lowwwww😣😣
3,Data tranfer speed is very slow takes more than  half an hour for 15 gb tranfer...
3,Heats up very early
3,Speed not as expected
3,"Device consistently disconnects from the Xbox, kicking me out of games downloaded to it."
3,Xbox doesn't always recognize it upon start up I have to unplug it and plug it back i
3,Was almost 2TB
3,Speeds are very slow
3,Literally only 1tb
3,"Good size, decent price, horrible speeds. Xbox one, Xbox One s, and Xbox One X, All tried with this HDD. All continuously disconnect randomly. And yes, I've tried changing start-up and power options, to no avail."
3,I recieved the seagate harddrive thinking that I would get 4 Terabytes but only to get 3.6 terabytes. Not what I paid for.
3,Was 1.81tb  Capacity.
3,Works as ordered.
3,I need to manually reconnect usb each time I turn on Xbox. It works but not without issues.
3,When plugged in has 1.8T instead of 2T that I was looking for
3,I could not connect to my Mac. But connects to my xbox
3,Na
3,"It works, wasn't 1TB though. Was really about 700Gb-ish"
3,Don't buy for a PlayStation 4 system. It's too old of a model. I need a 3.0 and this is not up to date.
3,I always have to unplug it and plug it back in for me to access my games
3,"When i ""backed"" up my pc and laptop all that is on the portable hard drive, are empty file folders. Granted, the names on the folders match both the pc and laptop"
3,"The side of the included USB cable that connects to the drive itself is incredibly wobbly, and if moved even slightly has a tendency to become unplugged and interrupt backups. It also writes quite slowly. It works well as a backup drive, but it's too slow to use as a functional external drive, and the inconsistent connection makes it impossible to use while on the go."
3,Only got 1tb and I paid the 2tb.
3,Needs a passcode. Regards Jim
3,It’s very slow but it came brand new.
3,"Arrived on may 15, 2020. worked well until 2 weeks later the drive stop lighting up. won't buy again. tried everything."
3,"I formatted it exFAT so I can use on pc and mac, though I use a macbook pro 2017 mostly. And this drive has been a nightmare. If the cord so much as gets bumped (which is often the case), it will come unplugged. You get the little pop up message saying it ejected without doing it officially. Normally, I just plug something back in. But no, not this dude. It's grayed out in DISK UTILITY. I can't mount or unmount it. It won't ""eject"" through THAT menu. Iiterally have to restart my computer over a dozen times...and try various things such as ... plugging it in first, then restarting. Then trying to wait to plug in until it's restarted. I do a handful of things, different each time, and when i'm about to chuck it, it will suddenly work. I'm so over it. I need to get a new drive now so I can copy everything off of this one (if it ever loads again)...as I'm on restart 14 this time.... the 5th time it's happened in the past month because my cat jumped up to lie down on the warm laptop. I'm over it. The last SeaGate drive I owned just stopped working--i tried everything. And then when I invested another $400 in a diff drive and spent a fortune trying to get all my files downloaded from my off-site server (BackBlaze, which is another cluster F of epic proportions)...after a month of tedious, time-consuming stuff, suddenly, it started working again. WHAT THE??? So back to toshiba or Western Digital I go."
3,"So I got it, I download my old game to it, I try to play it, and my system said it's no more space I have to delete something.  But it's on the portable drive though?"
3,its only 1.8 tb not 2 tb
3,Transfer speed is slower than a HDD I bought 5 years ago. My old HDD was a complete dinosaur....
3,I just recently purchased the 2TB one for my PS4 1TB. I received it within 2 days of my purchase and quickly connected it to my PS4 and followed the instructions. When it finally came out on my storage on PS4 it wasn’t 2TB. It shows only 918.4GB?????????
3,Very slow read and write speeds. USB 3.0 isn't even needed.
3,The package inside was already open.  I'm wondering if it's used.
3,For some reason Beyond drive I'm copying movies from is faster than the one I just bought and it's still a Seagate
3,Wont always stay connected/ seen by pc. I have to re connect usb sometimes for pc to see drive
3,Has 1.7 TB instead of the 2 TB seller claims to have.
3,"I bought this in december and when it arrived I read comments saying itll format when plugged in but it didnt for me it said ""cannot format this usb device as extended storage. "" I bought the 4tb one I had to do the exFAT to use the usb."
3,Making beeping sounds.. is that usual?
3,beeps and clicks a lot. it's SMR.avoid.
3,quality ad price
3,This item was open package and used.
3,It works but It isn't silent
3,Didn’t come with any cable’s
3,I am a big fan of Seagate and their various HDDs which are still the most practical and least expensive for large storage.  Unfortunately this drive seems slow and choppy in performance and didn't benchmark well over older WD Black or WD Blue drives - will keep it all the same for the price but not happy with the purchase.
3,I could not load it on my computer and returned it
3,"No cable, no instructions. Youtube install how to do videos.  But item is as described and stores data."
3,"Not that fast, and takes long time to wake up.. about 10 seconds. while my nas drive 2 seconds"
3,DOES NOT COME WITH A SATA CABLE. Set my build back about a day due to this.
3,"I ordered 4 of these drives for 4 different systems. These drives are loud in terms of spindle noise, its almost like these are refurbished devices. I also noticed a power issue with them during restarts, the drives don't seem to want to restart properly and hang. I would expect this in a Video system or server environment however a desktop environment is completely different. I would not advise that this be used as a primary drive. These would be questionable as even back up drives.I had an issue where one of these drives was reported as completely failed after only the third time being used.I used this as a secondary drive in the system partnered with a primary SSD drive and still experienced diminished operation.Do yourself a favor and avoid the headache that I had and save up for an SSD."
3,slightly smaller storage than advertised but its under 20gbs which for the amount of space I use its not noticeable atm
3,"Didnt give me all 3 tb, only gave me 2"
3,No installation information.. not even the usual screws that come with a new hardrive.. no mounting bracket.. glad I know how to install components.. next time will purchase local or from Newegg so it comes in original packaging with hardware.
3,I ordered it assuming it had a cable but silly me never assume
3,Just use it for Backup.
3,Bios recognizes it but software won't Sent back first one to try again.
3,so so
3,The corners of the case cracked for some reason after trying to put them on my computer...hope they did not scratch my computer.
3,keyboard thing keeps slipping off and case started to break after a couple of months
3,Does not show Apple logo
3,A few days of use and had a lot of scratches..bad material
3,The cover is fine and all but the rest of the products are trash except the little bag. The keyboard cover isn't perfect since you can't even see the lights for the letters and its doesn't align with them. The screen protector was hard to put on since one of the tags to remove the plastic didn't even work and it was very easy to get bubbles in. Would just the cover tbh.
3,"The case is okay, but my main issue is that the keyboard cover doesn’t line up. I got the correct one, but the letters don’t match up with the backlit ones on the cover. I have double vision trying to type. The symbols on the cover also dont match the ones on the keyboard. I had to buy another one :/"
3,"Is very flimsy, you get what you paid for."
3,when i got this case the bottom piece was very easy to put on but the top piece was more difficult. i’m not sure what was wrong but i think a piece was broken off and that’s why it wasn’t attaching to the top of my computer. overall i think it’s worth it but you can definitely find better cases
3,The keypad cover images do not match the actual keyboard images
3,shows fingerprints
3,mine cracked after a few weeks
3,Unfortunately doesn’t fit the laptop. It does look cool and the other versions of it worked well.
3,"Overall the keyboard and top cover fits like a glove. It is very durable, however the base section just did not work with the top cover. It restricted the Screen from opening beyond 90 degrees. The issue is both the upper cover and lower (left hand corner), cover touches and creates resistance in opening. This could eventually cause structural damage to the computer screen. Unfortunately I had to return the product. Good cover, but conflict in the back must be resolved."
3,It cracked
3,The top cover catches all of the fingerprints and is hard to wipe off so now I have fingerprint stains all over the top so it doesn’t look clean.
3,not what I expected
3,screen protector broken but the rest was fine
3,"This was a replacement because there was a scratch on the cover on the original order. Unfortunately, the replacement one also had visible marks on the cover. Have to return and try another brand or type of cover."
3,"Used it for a while. Easy to snap in the cover and also like the color. But it shows the fingerprints everywhere on the cover, which I don’t like."
3,This is called Serenity Blue but it is purple.
3,3 tiny little fans barely move air past the surface...I expected that kind of performance from a $10 pad with fewer reviews than this one...
3,Little bulky and needs some type of gripping material otherwise laptop slides off.
3,"So today marks 6 months exactly since I got this product, and during that time I have used it almost every day. It works great for the most part, but the USB connectors have now broken twice. I was able to repair it the first time, but the second time one of the components straight up broke. So yeah, that's what happens after 6 months of use I guess..."
3,"After 6 months, the noise started and it’s loud."
3,not really work to my laptop
3,It's very light but I can barely feel the air blowing
3,"It's really quiet, but doesn't do a great job at actually keeping my laptop cool (i7 CPU, nvidia1050 graphics card) with heavy use. The backlight is bright enough to see your keyboard well.Also, the pad itself needs one of its USB ports to connect to the laptop, so you only get one extra. And the included USB port doesn't work too well with devices with a high bitrate, like storage drives, monitors, or sound drivers—I ended up just connecting the pad itself to a new usb hub and not using its extra port.Ok for casual use, not great for gaming."
3,the smell makes me feel headache
3,After a month and a half one of the fans started getting slow and making too much noise.
3,"This product has a nice design, but it is noisy due to the fan motors' obsolete technology. Those fans use single-phase brushless DC motors, and they have rough commutation processes. So the fans make ticking noises as they turn due to the commutations the motors make. This product should use three-phase brushless motors for the fans, which run smoother and generate a lot less noise during commutation processes."
3,One of the fans didn't work when I plugged it in but it is still doing the job for now
3,Estandar.
3,The heat dissipation is minimal
3,"So everyone is aware; one of the pics has ""On/Off switchable LED light""; which is why i bought this; the on off button is for the light AND the fans...i really wanted to run the fans without the lights."
3,"My laptop would not stay in place on the surface, it kept sliding down.  You have to have the feet extended to lift it up for air circulation but the slant then causes the laptop to keep sliding.  I had to buy some ""sticky"" buttons and put them on the cooling pad to keep the computer in place."
3,Laptop overheats as though it's not there
3,"Have had this for a little over a year now, since then two of the fans have gone out.. expected it to last longer than that..."
3,"It's big for a 2020 MacBook pro 13, you'll feel the MacBook sliding and moving inside the case."
3,"I order a 14"" and It's 4 finger bigger than my computer:/"
3,"Bought 13.3"" . It is way too big for late 2020 m1 macbook air."
3,"The quality seems ok, but the color wine red doesn't correspond to the photo."
3,Color was not as pictured it’s more of a light and soft red
3,It’s more pink than red in color. Not what I imagined the color being.
3,I returned this one and kept the one I ordered with a handle.  The material is a bit thin also on this one.
3,Color i picked was way off what i got.
3,"Material was not what I expected, feels a little cheap but overall does the job. Water resistant, soft insides, and enough room for my iPad Air and keyboard plus some accessories in the front pouch."
3,“Wine red “ isnt red its a pink raspberry colour
3,It is big in size for 13 inch MacBook Pro
3,Came so dented and with a stain on it
3,I purchased this in wine- it come in and it is pink almost fuchsia colored.
3,way too big
3,Its much larger than my brand new mac book pro.
3,Muy grande para la Mac Air 2019Too big for a Mac Air 2019
3,"It didn’t last for too long, the zipper tore down"
3,Not as sturdy
3,"I bought the 13-inch case for my 13-inch MacBook and it was way too big. There’s so much more room then I was wanting, at least a couple inches, if not more. My computer slides around in the case, even with my ipad in the case along with it."
3,Bigger than expected
3,"Wine red color isn’t accurate, it’s pink"
3,The WiFi signal doesn’t reach very far at all.  A lot less than advertised
3,Extended Wifi  signalNo feedback from personSo unable to rate
3,Didn't reach as far as I wanted.
3,I still have it but don’t see a difference in the area I placed it for my WiFi
3,Did not magnify my Wi-Fi signal that much; can't really tell the difference before I got this extender.
3,"Works ok, signal goes in and out,  it all depends where you put it"
3,See rating
3,I can't tell if helped with the speed
3,Does not live up to its advertisement
3,It would not work with my camera
3,Don't think it helped at all... maybe a tad
3,It’s works when it wants to.
3,"I bought two of these and placed them around a two story house using the Tether App to locate the best positions. Using the OneMesh service with an Archer A7 router, there is now full signal nearly everywhere in the house.However, this comes at the cost of half bandwidth. 200mbps down from the main router, but if a device connects to the extender, it cuts the speed in half to about 70-120mbps. Tested using speedofme and speedtest by ookla. I feel this should be something stated clearly. Mildly annoyed there aren't many reviews mentioning this and I had to go to reddit to find other people noticing this. For the relatively cheap price, I wasn't expecting a seamless extension of the network, but half speed?It's a choice between a stable connection with slower speeds or keep low signal at higher speeds."
3,Back and forward always.
3,You have to make an online account with the manufacturer to set it up.  What kind of garbage is that?
3,Spotty wifi
3,This does not work thru Stine walls.
3,Doesn’t work
3,"It's just ok, nothing to write home about. Maybe my router is too far or I'm expecting more from this wifi booster then I should, but it disconnects fairly often and it's main purpose is to provide wifi to one room with a smart TV which it intermittently fails to do. When it does work, it's a toss up between slow or nothing."
3,"Returned because I couldn't get it to work, it may have just been me."
3,Doesn’t work as expected.
3,It does not work for games on internet
3,WiFi Signal
3,i have Gigabyte internet but the extender only pushes out 100mbps speed.
3,Not sure it is working as well as expected right outside the bedrooms and my kids need to come out into the hall to get a connection
3,"Didn't do much, if anything."
3,"The extender works for the most part if you are one person using it. I live in a house with other college students and the extender provides really weak signal once there's 2 or more people needing to do online class or watching tv. The extender has a ""location helper"" and it says it's in an optimal location in respect to its distance from the router. The extender also simply stops working multiple times a day. I have to unplug it and plug it back in for it to start working again. I'm disappointed because of the high reviews and thousands of purchases and I've been let down."
3,Did not see much difference
3,I don’t think spectrum cable is compatible with this product.
3,"The signal is not that great.Every day I enter the area and look at the device plugged into the wall, all of the lights are off.  I have to unplug it and plug it back in.  It will reconnect to the router and will work for the remainder of the day.Strange behavior.  I think I will be buying something else today to replace the device."
3,"It's an wifi extender for cheap. it's ok, but my 5G channel that is 500 Mbps download on the main router only get 50 Mbps on the extender ... so it only ok."
3,Why do they need to get on your phone?
3,Did not do what I expected.
3,COULDNT GET IT TO WORK FOR ME.
3,Goes on and off constantly
3,It only helped my tv by about 30 percent more. So I still went many nights without wifi in my room.  Our home is about 1900 square ft and the modem is at the middle and the plug was in between.
3,couldn't get it to work.
3,Won’t connect at 1gb with xfinity XB7 gateway using 80 foot cat 5e cable. Cat 5e should work up to 100 meters (300+ feet).The 8 port version works ok.
3,"Hi bought this to use with a Voip phone at work that doesn't have a direct power cable to the phone, (i.e. it uses power from the internet connection to operate) and found that it didn't supply the power needed to operate the phone."
3,"inside the manufacturers box was a plastic bag with someone's used, old, dry chewing gum.so, now i don't know what was supposed to be in the plastic bag, if anything.other than that, the product seems to work as advertised."
3,All ports do not work
3,"Needed to replace it after 7 months. Just quit, went down and could even ping or access it."
3,I bought this thinking it would have wan port in back but it works for what its needed for
3,It has lots of features nut no SNMP.  Bummer.
3,Had to return no longer needed. Have this item already in use. It works extremely well.
3,Tecnically is a 4 port switch because you have to use one port to connect it to the router.
3,Does its job
3,Functions
3,Keeps having to reset.
3,Works as expected but seems to stall to slow speeds at times.  Spent a  little time analyzing the issue but found nothing to indicate why.  It was a bargain price and I would buy it again
3,This is European Branded power. Beware when buying.
3,Fast service and Works as described
3,"It works, couple of issues with the web interface and the fact that the unit wants to be on the same subnet as the router."
3,"I have internet issues sometimes, and I think the switch just needs to be power-cycled.  Other than that it is a standard switch and ""just works"".  Although I needed to configure it the first time I used it."
3,"Not sure whats going on with this device..  My games start messing up and having issues when I plugged both my computers and modem into it. I ended up taking my computer out and hooking directly up to the modem again.. Only use it when I need to copy data between computers as my computers are both in a room far away from the single run I have to the modem. it works fine for simple internet and transfers, but my games had all kinds of issues with it."
3,Beware! You can manage it only via Windows machine!
3,"The ports are on one side - the power goes in the other. Had I investigated further, I would have selected a different configuration."
3,It needs a manual
3,"The switch works fine, but it has a very high pitch whine / noise at about 9500 hertz that occurs especially loudly when under load.  I've had to find another place to put it that wasn't close to where I was working, because it was giving me a headache.  Others have confirmed the problem on some units in the Amazon review section as well."
3,"It will cause noise while data is traveling. Especially, more data more noise."
3,"So far, it's exactly as advertised."
3,Gave this away.  I thought it was something else.
3,Functions decently. Windows based GUI (Java) is the only way to manage the switch.  802.1q setup seems purposely over-complicated. Had to submit port settings multiple times until I see the traffic work properly on PVID interfacs.
3,Gut
3,普通
3,It is not a router.
3,What can I say. Plugged it in and it worked. Haven't tried the port monitor yet.
3,"​Hard to connect, in the end, did not used it."
3,Did what it was required for however I need to buy a larger unit so will be using the same seller again for an 8way unit
3,Version 1
3,This has 4 USB slots but you will probably pnly be able to use 2 or 3 at a time. The slots are too close to plug to flash drives next to each other. You can only use all four slots if you are using only the new tiny flash drives.
3,Works for everything else.
3,I bought this to eliminate the need for multiple cubes. It DOES NOT WORK with iphones.
3,It did not work in my car
3,"I used the product to charge headphones, AA battery and Apple Watch. I guess it knew that I didn’t need the fourth port because it was not working when I got it."
3,It dose what it was made for
3,I had to return it. It didn't work.
3,Works intermittently.
3,My mouse and keypad don't work when I first turn on my computer. I have to re-plug the extension in before they will come back on.
3,The LED lights are slightly too bright making it annoying
3,Very cheaply made but works.
3,Takes my devices FOREVERRR to charge when plugged into this splitter
3,My Son requested this.
3,Laptop wouldn’t recognize my microphone when connected through this
3,It’s a decent product not the best in the world but worth the money
3,Need more USB get more USB
3,"Needs updates, longer cord"
3,It doesn’t feel sturdy
3,Won't work with our stuff
3,Did not work
3,Not a very long cord
3,We used it in the car for a road trip. We plugged it in in the back seat port and could not reach it from the front seat. When I used the front seat port it would not recognize the apps on my phone. All 4 ports would not charge at the same time.
3,"Beware, the ad doesn't say but this unit is directional.  It's 1 in 4 out ONLY.  It is not simply a bus. You cannot split 1 device to 2 or more computers."
3,We’re not charging my phone or any other equipment except my flashlight
3,I should have read more into the description/functionality of product didn't put out enough power to do what I needed it to do.
3,"looks nice,like quality material but I bought this after reading the reviews and thought it would work with my computer but it does not.I will be returning."
3,"3 out of 4 of the ports work, but the 4th one won't turn on."
3,Not reliable. One port works all the time the others work intermittently
3,works as advertized
3,Doesn’t work with iPhones
3,DOES NOT CHARGE. This won't charge your things. Its JUST a hub. So i can't say anything about. Except the cord is short.
3,"This is slow charger and doesn’t work on certain items, wish that would have been more clear in description. In addition, the buttons are easy to hit so you accidentally turn it off. Now I have to buy new product that actually charges so this was a waste"
3,"It did not work with my apple products, I ordered 2 of them and tried many different cables to charge my Apple Watch and Phone but it did work for my non apple products."
3,Should have purchased 3.0 version
3,It's what you would expect from a cheap hub.
3,"I’ve used this for a long time now, this is a good concept but from time to time it stops being recognized by my computer causing me to restart maybe 1-2x per month."
3,Loose/inconsistent connections with the female ports.
3,bought  2 one fell apart
3,"I purchased a new comput that had just one 2UBS PORT.  I have a mouse plugged in and that's about all this decice will charge.. Cannot plug printer into it, cannot plug iPhone into it and other things. I sure didn't get my monies worth.I would NOT recommend to buy."
3,To small a picture
3,This system quits recording even while motion is detected
3,"I got this camera to see which one of my cats was peeing on my bed. The motion detection has caught my cat leaving the room but never them coming in- even thought the camera was pointed to cover the whole entrance. It did not catch any motion of the cat peeing on my bed, even though it was 100% included in the selected film range. Overall a decent camera. It’s always caught me and my family walking around, but if your intention is for pets I would chose a different camera."
3,Don't always work
3,Our internet is 5G only and this camera only works with a 2.4G.  I couldn't set it up because of our internet.  I am returning the camera.
3,Only works for motion and can only record 10 seconds
3,The camera is a little substandard versus The outdoor but the thing that gets me is the subscription rates when you add a second camera
3,Makes too much noise  purpose of cameras is to be unnoticeable
3,I just contacted Customer Service by chat. The sound does not work in the camera. I can hear sound on my phone but nothing comes out of the camera when I talk to it.
3,Cord not long enough.
3,The pictures upside down
3,Doesn’t hold connection
3,Camera kept disconnecting from module
3,Makes a static noise
3,Good quality when it works. Frequently stops recording at night and has to be woken by clicking live view. Customer service didn’t resolve issue.
3,Makes a loud clicking noise when in live mode
3,Doesn't work thru the windowAnd there is now a monthly fee
3,Goes off line frequently
3,"It does work and record, but if you need real-time notifications I'd look to something else. It does the recordings, but even after re-installing the app and reconnecting the camera several times I don't get the notifications."
3,It keep repeating the same video over an hour and make to much click noice.
3,As of now still unable to connect camera set up. Contacting Blink this week
3,It's OK. Doesn't always pick up motion.
3,These are not recording/alert if you don’t access the app !!
3,Does not wake up to catch early morning motion in the house
3,"Camera is good quality picture and easy set up. But the live view is extremely delayed. Also, you can’t watch live video for more than maybe 30 seconds without having to click out and back in."
3,If you use it in a room that is pitch black and someone turns on the lights it doesnt detect the motion. Total junk.
3,For the price it's a pretty decent product. Good picture quality sound is not so great. The major downfall of this product is the battery life. I used it for motorcycle commute. I was able to make it to work but on the commute home battery dies. They give you two batteries but you barely get one hour if that each battery charge. Sorry but I will be returning this product. If that's not a concern for you it's a decent product for the price. And cannot view recorded videos via app on my iPhone.
3,I used it in my car to capture the back roads and the battery life is a lot shorter than another action camera.  Used it once ride and returned it just because of battery life.
3,"Very very, complicated. It will take a while to figure out."
3,It will get you started but video quality and stability is ok.
3,This does not include a needed micro card.
3,Unfortunately wasn’t worth the buy.. my dad said the quality was good.. but never connected  to any device
3,Looks good.Need to try it.
3,The camera quality isn’t what I expected. Looks a little grainy. I have not yet tried it under water
3,"Bought for my grandson for Easter. Worked at first then would not let him power on. Very disappointing..called and they are sending a replacement , however it is taking a long time to get. So when we do get it im keeping my fingers crossed it works this time!"
3,normally
3,"Very light, feels cheaply made"
3,"I took the camera out for the first time yesterday and the latch on the waterproof case broke.  Upon inspection, it looks like the design is very flimsy.  You also need to buy an SD card reader if you want to be able to transfer images off the camera - it estimates that it will take 60-minutes to transfer photos from the camera to my iPhone via wifi and the camera isn't recognized by my computer when I try to connect it via USB."
3,"Haven't used the product yet, bought it to use on kayak. So far just learning about it by looking on internet."
3,Takes a decent picture. Will record about 1hr video in 1080p on battery.
3,Three stars
3,The battery only last 20 minutes
3,"Video is decent. Audio is terrible, even with no case on it. Battery life is sub par, but it does come with 2 batteries. Basically, if you use it for video only and don't need the audio, it will be fine. If you want audio that can heard, don't buy it. I have to turn the audio all the way to max and can still barely hear what was recorded."
3,"The camera did its job, but I needed more"
3,Haven't been able to get it to work yet.
3,Works as it should.
3,"I bought two of them. One of them works, but second one did not work."
3,So much for this brand name.
3,I expected the card to last more than 2 monthsGot corrupted and wouldn't work againWont buy evo brand again
3,"The reason I gave this card a middle rating is it cannot be formatted to FAT32, which is what my cameras take.  The firmware was changed from the first time I ordered one, to this one. So for me, it is a brick.IF you need FAT32  this will not format to that protocol."
3,Too expensive
3,First time in my life I have bought a sd card and it die within 30days of purchasing. Honestly I've never even heard of this dying but I sure got the dud.
3,First one didn't work. Second one did.
3,Solid reviews let me to my purchase of this have not had a chance to use time will tail
3,"Ordered 2 64 and 32, the 32 is not read, waiting for the exchange. The test speed of the 64 is decent."
3,It didn’t work with my dash-cam.
3,I experience some files or folders lost -> please go for SanDisk brand
3,Works
3,And cannot reformat
3,"Arrived on time. As soon as it was installed, the phone recognized it and made it available for storage."
3,"After placing this micro sd in my phone, it only shows that there's 119 gb available and 4.75mb are used. I paid for 128 gb not 120/119. What's the deal?"
3,The memory has shrunk a lot.  It doesn’t seem to run as fast as expected
3,119 GB not 128
3,only 59 gb instead of 64
3,⭐⭐⭐
3,"Average write speed is 51 MB/s, and read speed is 66 MB/s. Never came close to 100 MB/s as advertised. Going to do other testing to see if I am going to keep it."
3,I didn't get even 500gb with this card.
3,Product as described
3,must have for any phone BUT again does not cover entire screen
3,After a few weeks of being in my pocket with my keys some small cracks and scratches have begun to show. I have yet to replace it with the second protector that the pack came with. It gets the job done tho.
3,The wet cleaning wipes were dry as a bone
3,Fingerprints & smudges very apparent.  Cracked on first day when it fell less than 1 ft!
3,Did't like...does't cover all screen...
3,The product works well as far as protection but I have bought 2 packs and they have sent me a pack due to the issues I was having but all of the screen protectors bubble around the edges after a couple weeks making it hard to tap anything under it. I have to change them every couple weeks.
3,"Three came in the package. One came cracked, one was not sticky. Was able to use one of the three in the package."
3,They may as well not even include the alcohol wipes because there’s no alcohol on them
3,Very sturdy. Full body case for my Samsung S21 5G cell phone
3,They seemed of lesser quality than the one it was to replace
3,I’ve bought screen protectors in the past that last months without cracks but these are not at all durable and barely last a week. I went through all three in the pack in just under two weeks because of how often they crack / chip from minor occurrences
3,See title
3,It cracked with in a week
3,"I feel this will work to give my I phone 11 screen protection from scratches from all the junk I carry in my pockets.  The screen works, that is, it is pressure sensitive just as the original was, but there seems to be a small space (1/8-1/4"") all around the face that is not covered by the screen."
3,Not at all
3,If only I could find one of these that doesn't collect bubbles.
3,i’m sure other people got better batches than me or can just apply it better than i can but it has a lot of bubbles and wasn’t very easy to apply. i also only got 2 in the pack even though it’s advertised as 3
3,"Not a strong screen protector, drop one and it will crack. Installation and everything else was fine though. Good thing it comes with 3."
3,Works for screen protection but it cracks every time your phone hits the ground. I’ve used others that were more durable
3,Runs small
3,A little small but technically fits
3,Doesn’t cover all The screen
3,These are more for iPhone XR’s and not really fly the 11
3,Slightly too small for the screen
3,Brooke first time I dropped it.
3,not recomended
3,Most recent batch has hairline fractures after “normal” phone drops...  glass can splinter off if phone is dropped too.
3,"Ive dropped and thrown my phone, wit this screen protector my phone still didn’t crack... The screen protector itself has crack but it’s still protecting my phone from being cracked"
3,Too small
3,This did not work on my phone it was a tad longer than my actual screen
3,"somehow would crack while i was just holding it, never dropped it but the case would crack within 3 days of having it on my phone"
3,While trying to install this protector I didn’t get it right till I had only one left the side that’s supposed to stick dry way too fast
3,Hello
3,The glass didn’t feel quite right
3,Does not cover whole surface
3,Could have been a littlecheaper.
3,Everything  works with any provider
3,The battery is going down kinda quick when u turn it off the battery percentage goes up by it self
3,Home button non functional.
3,Item came without a charger
3,No way this battery is 80% of original capacity.
3,Battery is trashed have to carry a charger everywhere
3,"The battery lasted about 10 minutes on a full charge. Customer service made me purchase a new one, out of pocket, and return the old one before they would send a refund. The refund took several months."
3,The charger that came with the phone did not work at all. And the phone shuts down randomly.
3,The charger port wouldn’t hold my charger in place
3,Had it for one year and it overheated. The battery life was only 86% when I got it.
3,Shipped last minute from my predicted date paid for expedited shipping. Phone gets hot after extended use ( anything over two hours) touch stops working at random times but locking and unlocking clears that issue. Speakers are LOUD to that’s a pro.
3,i have to go to apple because i got this phone for verizon and it wont let me make calls or texts sooooo basically dont buy it
3,Cord does not work!
3,"The screen is tinier than my droid. It does not recognize my fingerprint a lot. The picture showed that little pen when I bought it, but it was not in the package, nor did it arrive later. I have to recharge the battery often."
3,Being a used phone watch out for battery life the batteries are not changed out on used phones so they won’t have the normal battery life.
3,One of the speaker on the phone do not work
3,Na
3,Battery drains from 100 to zero in 5 hours
3,Battery life is insufficient and less than expected.
3,This phone did not hold charge and is now not even turning on no matter how long you put it to charge. It shuts off. Only had it since April of 2020. I purchased another two one for my son and one for my daughter and hers is the one that won’t hold charge or do anything.
3,There was a screen protector  when removed it there was scratches on screen which makes me soo dissapointed😶
3,Clarification on unlocking to all services
3,"the volume on the ringer barely works and i cant use imessages, it will not connect"
3,not working smoothly
3,"Battery needed replaced immediately, Audio Chip in phone burned out in 6 months and now need to replace the phone."
3,Brought the phone and use it maybe 2 cases and couldnt use it
3,The phone was ok. I had a few issues but nothing major.
3,me
3,Could only hear on speaker phone.
3,"Phone has glitches. Appears up to date but things don't run properly. I purchased more storage for the phone but it still says I don't have enough storage. Screen freezes, turning the phone on and off only works temporarily if at all, among other things I am noticing more and more day by day and it's only been a week."
3,battery issues
3,Maximum capacity on battery is 81%
3,battery runs too... fast. Last less than a day.
3,A lot smaller than I thought or wanted
3,Battery life was at 72%
3,"Battery doesn’t hold power , phone dies a million times a day"
3,Camera couldn’t focus it was continually trying
3,Excelente
3,The phone was very 4.7 in size and the battery life was 78 percent and for a iPhone this size should be at least 80 percent.
3,Phone arrived without a sim tray making it unusable until I could purchase a replacement tray.
3,Came with a screen protector.
3,Phone  Charger didn't work
3,The battery does not last
3,"this product didnt make one year and tore up, now i have to take it to the apple store to have it fixed, dissadisfied  with this product,"
3,Screen came cracked smfh....
3,Battery doesn’t last long.
3,Bought this iPhone to use on tracfone it works but can’t use the WiFi calling feature.
3,This phone was sold to me with a battery that doesn’t charge all the way.  Servicing will cost substantially more money.
3,"The screen does have a long and visible scratch. It should be replaced before resale.The qualification ""renewed"" would not correct."
3,Not compatible with Verizon sim card
3,See above
3,A little heavy
3,a little smaller than i thought it would be taking pic.
3,"I can't turn off the alarm without turning off the phone. Three of us tried and you cannot cancel or snooze the alarm. In fact, you can't even turn down the volume. These are some interesting features for a phone.Amazon recommends that I return the item or I guess I could carry around an alarm clock and not use the alarm feature."
3,It's a so so phone. It works. A little laggy. I'd get the one plus nord instead.
3,Long run is not compatible
3,Late is slow
3,Doesn't last three days
3,"The screen size was adaquate. Pictures were decent. Font was too small for my liking, even at it's largest. The system froze up several times after having it only a few weeks. Sound quality wasn't impressive. I returned it. Motorola just isn't what it used to be back in the day."
3,... but otherwise a decent phone
3,even though it is unlocked phone but it wont let you turn on hot spot
3,I do not like this phone. It's preference leaves a lot to be desired. Battery life is incredible.
3,A bit complicated
3,"Not impressed for the money.  Felt very cheap.  Super lite watch, not impressed with the construction."
3,Battery doesn't last as long as advertised and gps location for time can be quirky where it changes by one hour periodically and I have to reset. This has happened 4 or 5 times this month. Without those issues it would be a 5.
3,One of the buttons gets stucks every once in a while causing it to skip music tracks twice or more in a row.
3,Battery runs out too fast
3,"Running, swimming"
3,"Would rate the tracker at a 5, if the text feature was more reliable. It works intermittently."
3,"The watch lost connection with my phone and I was not able to pair it again until my phone operating system updated. Quite possibly an issue with the phone, but still annoying. Otherwise good watch- seems well made and sturdy. Be aware that this is not a touch screen watch and can be a bit confusing to use the sequence of buttons."
3,"Have had for over two months now. Battery life isn’t as advertised, maybe 4 days and tracked miles while mountain biking is always less that what Strava indicates."
3,It works that all I can say.
3,bought this because my grandkids were misrouted by the school on an overflow bus with out them letting their parents know.  Wanted to know where they were at all times.  Then found once it was received that they couldn't afford the monthly subscription necessary to make it work.
3,Subscription is expensive
3,It would take long to refresh
3,The accuracy isn't quite right but it will tell you where they are just gotta get used of it it jumps around a lot
3,As expected
3,Will not pick up signal most of the time.
3,On several occasions device didn't show current location... when I needed it to. Other than that 5*
3,Small and works
3,Can't set it up.
3,location not accurate
3,"Device will not auto update. Customer ""support"" tells you to do the same thing over and over with no result. Email support is even worse the person saying they tried to call you (no) and they need more information and to call back then you get the same runaround."
3,Tracking is off after second day of using
3,Battery dies to quick. And notifications work when they want to (but I will see them whenever I login to the app)
3,Not very accurate device.
3,It technically worked. But I wouldn’t say “in real time.” Customer service did refund me for my 30-day subscription though. So there’s that.
3,Was not as accurate as I needed
3,The app had glitches !
3,Battery life was very short
3,Does not hold charge for very long.
3,"I was expecting the device to be tracked from my phone on an app, but not a monthly subscription fee that does not have an On/Off option. So even when not needed, it is still a fee."
3,Accuracy is not consistent
3,I live in a remote area in Alaska gps is slightly of and slow to respond. Battery life dosent last but a half day-one day and it need to be recharged nightly.
3,liam from billing was awsome per my requests !
3,Soso
3,vey slow update. Takes too long to find target and does not show live movement.
3,A bit complicated and does not always pop up on phone?
3,I just have for one day so can’t tell
3,The bathery doesnt even last 48 hrs after 10 hrs plugged to the outlet.
3,Seems to work
3,This was way to bulky for a key chain or my small dog’s collar
3,Location updates to slow. Shows not in range when standing in front of me. Location on map not same place tile is.
3,So far this works well but you have to pay over $30 for the app.
3,Long delays in receiving response and only available via email.  Very time consuming.
3,It’s small
3,"Gave one to my wife, and the other to my daughter.They really wanted to try them since they both are always searching for their keys (or phone).Took a while to get them working with their phones.  They had some issues with connectivity, and something else that I cannot remember.Eventually, they both have given up and do not now use them.  Apparently, it was too much trouble.I cannot say much from personal experience, because I was not involved in setting them up."
3,"My iPhone 7 can never find these. We put one on our cat who barely goes outside (the other roam the neighborhood.) He took it off some where in the house, and the app says it’s up the street and we can’t find it."
3,Nine months later it shows its location but the audio ring is only a momentary beep. Can’t find the tile without searching everything.  It just that it’s near.
3,"It works sometimes, but once a while it does't work. They did not mentioned it needs subscription."
3,The distance is not as advertised. It should be 400 feet but it can barely make it from one side to the other of my small apartment. Also it can never find my phone even when all the correct settings are on. It will be right next to my phone and will say it cannot detect it. Isn't serving me much use at the moment.
3,"The Tile Pro is much larger than necessary for any use I can imagine.  For those of us who carry keys in our pockets, the Tile is way too bulky especially if you also have a car fob on the same key ring .  The company needs to make them much smaller and thinner.  Separately, it goes without saying, the auto industry needs to build locators into their key fobs so we don't need to add Tiles to the key ring."
3,Daughter uses it all the time.
3,probably a google spy following your every move
3,I bought these to wear while I ride my quad. They aren’t very loud at all
3,When on the phone the other person can not hear you.  Too much noise
3,Just a little too big but they did have different cushion sizes and when you touch then they are very sensitive
3,They're big.
3,Not loud enoughHard to answer calls3rd pair of these series of head Tozos.
3,The charger case has to be recharged constantly. I only use them for maybe thirty minutes at a time and after about the second or third time of use I have to recharge the case. Seems excessive compared to other earbuds I've had in the past.
3,Doesnt work in water
3,They are not really that loud. Decent bass though.
3,Could be louder
3,"Mehhh. I researched these because I didn’t want to spend a crazy amount of money on ear buds. That was a mistake, just spend the money on good ones, you get what you pay for with these. I bought them mainly to mow lawn with, and I can barely hear the music over the mower. They’re absolute junk. Don’t waste your money."
3,Couldn’t get them to stay in my ears even doing simple tasks so returned.
3,You’ll know what I mean
3,They showed up late and without a charger 🤷🏼‍♀️
3,For some reason it repeatedly disconnects during calls.  Not when listening to music but consistently during phone calls.  (My main need for the ear pieces). I’ve tried unpairing and reconnecting several times but continues to be an issue.
3,The sound quality is good but they keep falling out of my ears
3,"These are very well made. The sound quality is incredible and it does block outside noise in the sense you can hear the person, however, the person on the other end of the phone can hear everything around you. Sometimes the things around you are even louder than you. If that issue could be fixed I would give these 5 stars. I like the adaptable earbud sizes, they ear buds fit well and don’t make your ears uncomfortable for quite some time. Over all very good but the noise issue made them almost useless."
3,Everyone say that they can hear everything else but me sometimes
3,Volume could be higher.
3,They looked brand new but I couldn't get the bud's to turn on so I returned for a refund.
3,"When I touch my ears because they itching, the tooth shuts off. I cannot simply tap the Bluetooth device to reconnect. If I have the phone charging,  I have to get up and hit the Bluetooth icon on the phone to continue my conversation"
3,"Prefer a generic Bluetooth,  without needing an app."
3,"Won't stay in ears, no matter size of ear rubber. Too heavy, so fall right out even just sitting at the computer..forget exercising with them. Why do cheap ones have battery life 3 x longer?"
3,I love them. But I can only use one. My left earbud suddenly won't play sound besides incredibly quiet. Resetting does nothing. Don't know how to contact the seller to find out what to do. They are good otherwise but only using the right earbud all the time is making my ear very uncomfortable.
3,Right earbud doesn't work properly. I guess that's what I get for buying used.
3,Music
3,"These earbuds are great at first. I started with the original Galaxy Buds, then one side died completely and never worked again. I attributed that to the silicon lottery, so I upgraded to the Buds+. Then, it happens again after about a year having this pair. I'm a Samsung fan, but I can't endorse the lifespan and overall quality of this product."
3,"Audio has a ""tinnie"" quality."
3,"If you move your jaw, these will loosen and fall out. If you sweat too much while wearing them, they will automatically skip songs, etc.Samsung really needs to introduce an anti-loss strap for these."
3,"Decent pair, don't work with other brand besides Samsung"
3,"After only having the earbuds for about a month, the right earbud started disconnecting and now it doesnt work Doesnt register, doesn't charge , just doesn't work at all."
3,Left earbud quit working after 6 months.
3,These weren't supposed to be refurbished but they are not the quality of the ones I had prior which were exact same.
3,The earbuds are too touch sensitive. I keep pausing or fast forwarding my music every time I try to adjust the earbud in my ear. The fit is not that great either. I've gotten better sound quality (and less annoyance) from Skullcandy or ME Buyz earbuds.
3,Don’t stay in ear
3,They randomly disconnect a lot. Get Bose.
3,They were just ok.Very little noise canceling
3,I can’t hear one side of it.
3,Not much of a difference or upgrade between this and the first gen pair.
3,Didn't like these. They kept falling out of my ear. I do have small ears & tried the different gaskets they came with..nothing worked. Admittedly they didn't sound too bad.
3,Useful at home during day.  Awful blue flashing at night renders themUseless.
3,Foam earpieces came off right away. Was able to slip them over but they continuous come off
3,"It didn’t come with a charger, the box was very beat up"
3,I Ordered a product that did not work for  my TV
3,Mic doesn't actually work
3,Regular quality
3,The sound is not loud
3,"The ear things fell off , dont last long"
3,They work! The soft thing fell off though. I had to tape/glue it back on.
3,"Absolutely no noise cancellation, which is a disappointment because that was the main reason for buying them. I’d give it 0 stars for that category if I could. Easy to setup though. Clear sound quality, but not a lot of bass."
3,The charger connection part in the headphone break within three months. I have to manually hold and push the charger cable in order for it to charge. I tried contacting the company and have not yet received a reply.
3,These work very well and are comfortable; however the volume is way too loud. Note this is per my 16 year old son who likes his music loud. This is also with the volume on the lowest setting. It is uncomfortable enough that we are ordering a different set because they hurt his ears.
3,Quality
3,"A little bit cheap feeling, but it does the job."
3,Disconnects when attached to the screen but works wirelessly
3,They still have phantom drift and connectivity issue.
3,These quit working within a 3 months of buying them. It was part of a Christmas gift for my kiddos. I ended up going to target and buying the gray set that have held up. I'll need to buy replacement parts to get this set up and working again.
3,The batteries drain way too fast for a new joycon.
3,"Brand new and started drifting soon after use. I can’t believe It, do I have to send away 2 sets now?"
3,Is the same as the ones your switch will come with. They are just as prone to drift
3,IIIV
3,The controllers are fine but the color in my opinion is not yellow. To me it looks more like neon green. I was disappointed.
3,"Someone had the genius idea to buy a set of these joycon for their switch, and swap the old ones they got, probably from launch day when they got the console. Grabbed their old ones and put them in the box then sent them back!"
3,"I thought this came with a center plastic holder, it does not"
3,"Way too expensive, but they work as expected."
3,Pricey!
3,The red controller is not working blue controller only working
3,"This is a very delicate procedure that can easily end in disaster & a $100 bill to replace your mistake. High quality and good instructions, the actual change out was above mine and my sons ability in the end. We succeeded on the first and failed on the second."
3,Ordered a pair of these joy cons and the green controller dial can’t point to the right. Didn’t notice until playing Just Dance and realized that I can move cursor to the right. Had to return them without the box and the new ones are so expensive ($160 plus fees and tax). Sad experience.
3,"After using these controllers for less than a month, the left controller disconnects for brief moments multiple times a gaming session.  I have hardly used them and this really hinders game play.  It's too late to exchange so it sucks for the consumer."
3,You don't even get then same amount of plastic as a Wii Remote. How am I supposed to sodomize anyone with this thing?
3,"Honestly, this has been a disappointing controller and I wanted to like it.  I have had the standard Xbox controller, the previous Elite controller and they have all had similar issues.  The bumper buttons fail and the thumb sticks either drift or do not press down any longer.  I know Microsoft has attempted to address these issues but so far no luck.  The controller feels better the the first elite, in other words, more solid and quality seems better if you ignore the repeating issues.  This controller lasted less than a year but I tried to deal with the issues thinking I had another month on the warranty.  Unfortunately I misremembered the date of purchase and missed the warranty window by days.I would recommend purchasing the less expensive, less well made and less featured version of the Xbox controller so replacement isn't as costly.  I would also purchase a extended warranty if available.  At the first sign of issue, contact Microsoft, DO NOT WAIT like I did."
3,Ordered new and got used for new price.
3,A button on my control doesn't work. What do I do?
3,3 stars because of the minimal drift to the left stick.
3,"For the $$$ that this controller costs, you would think they could at least throw a stick ""zeroing"" or calibration feature to the software. After only 3 months left stick drifted up and down directions. Had to go through the hassle of sending to Microsoft for warranty replacement."
3,Unit opened and used . Didn’t notice or use until after return time passed...
3,"In the description it said nothing was broken, but the right stick had a lot of stick drift that it affected other buttons"
3,Got my controller it's working fine no button sticking or thumbstick drift. It did come with a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate trial code that has been redeemed already which shouldn't be happening since it was SUPPOSED to be bought brand new. Something petty to review on still I paid $180 for this so I expect everything to be as new of course I shouldn't have expected much from whom ever who sold this.
3,Controller will randomly turn off even on a full charge. also having issues with controller drift that is starting to become more apparent
3,"For the money it costs, to purchase these type items, you would expect that they would work beyond 90 days.  I purchased mine in Dec of 2019 and received it in Jan.  No problem with anything, at first.  The charging cradle is great.  The reception gets a little flaky at times and says that it is no longer connected to the Xbox, when the light shows that it is clearly, on.  Of course, disconnections happen at the most inopportune times and last for about 10 to 15 seconds.  8 months in.............. the right bumper started to fail.  Of course, the standard warranty is for only 90 days.  It is unbelievable that, for the price, that the controllers are the weakest link in game play.  My first controller lasted 2 years.  I guess I was lucky.  Now, I am forced to buy another controller.  SMH........"
3,Bought it in February and already have stick drift
3,"Controller came very quickly but only had a single replacement paddle for the paddles on the back. Not one set of each, just one short paddle"
3,Left thumb stick started to drift about 5 months after purchasing
3,Item did not come with the USB C cable.
3,"I believed that I had ordered a new item, only to receive an item that had already been opened.  Seals had been removed and there were knife marks on the packaging.  Item was returned."
3,Dislike.-immediate driftLikes-weight-everything else
3,Has a 2 part plugin. USB is for the lights. And headphone jack for sound. More for laptop than using with controllers.
3,I can't use it in my laptop.
3,"I’m very picky, and the headset did not meet all my expectations. I wish it was wireless, the wires are too damn long, and also I wanted the volume to be a little louder."
3,Functional headphones but it looks really cheap.
3,"It's comfy, has decent volume and controls, but doesn't last a full year."
3,As the title says
3,Might just me my pc or Xbox but the mic was very quiet for everyone on the discord call and Xbox party
3,The microphones too quiet
3,Mic doesn’t work for my sons PS4
3,these are ok when i bought these i thought it would be perfect to tune out outer noise it doesnt its good to hear for music & if you play it others that are in your surroundings can hear just as much as you can.... phone calls can be heard thru these headphones... might send back but really dont like
3,They work
3,Had to buy the Adapter separately
3,The only time u cant hear anything is when u have it on full volume
3,They aren’t noise cancellation and have a very loose fit on my ears. Also the sound quality is pretty bad and delayedThey’re decent starter headphones though.
3,Everything’s good except the fact the mic doesn’t pick up anything so no one can hear you and the voice cancellation is 0%
3,My son uses these. This is the second time i bought it and he keeps saying the audio makes noises.
3,Eh
3,gets the job done
3,The headset was very good and sounded great but the wire broke two months after using them and now they aren’t able to be used.
3,Had to return because they quit working.  Got a new one immediately.  It quit working a few days later too.
3,Static sound while using.
3,Started having issues with miceophone shortly after purchase. Will not buy again.
3,External leds do not light up on my headset.
3,its not really good its ok
3,Thin. Wierd gray color
3,Not really soft at all. I have bought other towels which are much softer.
3,wasn`t as thick or soft as expected.
3,It gives off lots of lint after washing
3,Far too many misc threads and pulls were visible.
3,I used it after a shower and it leaves lint on my body. It's also starting to cover my bathroom in lint in places i rarely touch
3,Threads get caught and pulls the threads in the towels
3,These towels are not very absorbent and are uneven.
3,This is why you don’t order online
3,The only issue I have is the color of the towels. They are about 2 shades lighter than I expected.
3,Discoloration after first wash
3,"These towels are thick and soft, but the color faded to almost white in some spots after the first wash."
3,The color was not the same as pictured
3,It's on the thinner side
3,Just average.
3,Not as thick and as absorbent as I expected.
3,Kinda rough
3,These towels really aren't GOLDthey're between a brown  and a beige..they really aren't the color gold I was looking for but their just guest towels..disappointing
3,Extreme lint on first wash. Do not wash with anything else. Medium thickness and softness. Absorbency slightly above average. A sufficient set for the price.
3,"I received 2 towels , not the completed set ."
3,Gave slot of little fabric balls when washed.
3,Color. In the Bathroom. Some of the edging on the wash cloths started to fall apart after the 1st washing. Cheaply made.
3,"If you looking for a gold color no this is more like a tan call color , and the towels was not fluffy at all hard material."
3,"Washed three times, there is a hole in one of the towels!!!"
3,My package only included 2 washcloths instead of 4.Good quality though
3,Too much lint
3,What is to be expected. nothing special. not a great but ok deal.
3,"Decent product, they are absorbent but on the cheaper made side"
3,Thin
3,They are not durable at all. My towels are already unraveling on the side stitching after 3 washes. Cheap towels and cheap quality
3,towels did not have darker color trim as seen in the picture. also not as thick as video.
3,so
3,not soft at all
3,"I purchased these thinking they would match the beige in our guest bath. I did not wash them, I just hung them up out of the packaging for decoration only. They are not beige, they are a pale mustard yellow color. I do not know if they are absorbent or soft as they will not be used. The dye batches must have been separate as some are lighter and some are a shade darker."
3,Did not a year with my son .
3,Not soft or full
3,not as thick as i would have thought
3,Towels aren’t that thick guess the price is right
3,The smell before you wash it
3,I did not get one of my large towels.in the set.
3,"This towel could be softer, It feels little rough."
3,"The photo shows a deep purple color, which is what I wanted. However, the towels I received are 2 to 3 shades lighter. I am returning them. The towels are not as thick as I thought they were."
3,Washes poorly with shinkage
3,Does not stay in place. The toilet one does but not the rectangular one for the sink.
3,It was used for bathroom.
3,Too small
3,"Rugs beginning to pill. Soft, but they tend to slide around on tile floor.Will not buy again."
3,Really little
3,The color is deep and looks lux but the rug doesn’t grip onto the tile.
3,After 3 washes the backing comes off.
3,Does not stick to tile floors
3,"This rug is soft and the colors have never faded, even after washing. The problem is that it absorbs so well that it doesn’t dry out all the way and now smells musty, even after washing. I have this rug right outside the shower. I won’t purchase this again."
3,"They are soft and absorbent, but they slide. I adjust them 7,000 times a day. If you’re looking for a non slip rug, this is NOT it."
3,Some of the shag parts are coming outNot as thick as my last ones I boughtI’m think my first set came from a different company
3,Rug shed a lot
3,Replacement and match addition on other of the same brand. The only brand allowed in my bathrooms going forward.
3,Seeabove.
3,Color was not exactly what I wanted.
3,Doesn’t absorb water at all. Puddle underneath the mat
3,Was not the quality that I expected. For a room without a lot of traffic it would be ok.
3,Not enough rubber backing . Still slides
3,Not as much rubber backing as expected. They do slide on floor
3,The rug was very sift but not plush at all.  It was very thin.  I’m returning it.
3,Not as dense as pictures and color different from pictures.
3,"It flattens when stepped on. Gorilla grip does not keep rug in place.  It was the correct size and color, but ""luxurious"" is a stretch when describing the softness."
3,"Standard loop style bath mat.  It is soft and absorbent, however it does NOT stay put.  It moves around and I am constantly straightening it.  The gorilla grip backing is not as good as I thought.  It’s just ok"
3,Rug is a different color than the picture and the edges are freyed.
3,Returned product
3,Bought this for the fact it advertised softness/cushion which is a complete fabrication on the 17 x 24 size.
3,"Color was not as in photo. Rug was thin, lacking quality."
3,"I expected the rug to be thicker, softer, more plush.  I have not washed it yet.  I do not find it stays in place"
3,It wasn’t as dense as I had expected and you could see between the yarn. I will probably use it for a bath mat and get a different rug.
3,"Not as plush as it seems, very  thin"
3,Not what I expected
3,Overpriced for the quality.
3,Needs suction cups on bottom to hold in place. Mine moves
3,"I think it catches some hair, but the design reduces drainage. So now the shower floor is dirty with soap scum instead of hair. Product needs improvement."
3,Not reliable
3,I found that these hair catchers kept slipping out of the way and letting the hair into the drain but they were cheap and they may work for other shower configs for all I know.
3,Moves around a little too much so it doesn't catch all the hair
3,They catch hair ! But annoying to clean !
3,"According to the photo, I thought that they would be convex, but as it turned out, they are flat and not convenient to use. They can only be used for the kitchen sink."
3,They work well but it’s hard to get my long hair untangled from it
3,Stops hair from going down the drain but it gets tangled in the spikes and makes it a bit difficult to clean
3,"It wasn’t what I expected, it moves with the water, doesn’t have a suction system in the bottom ."
3,"Would not buy again, not something practical"
3,Do not stay in drain
3,These slip out of place
3,Slows down water drainage
3,These have no suction power they are always moving. I do like the color but the gabs are so big that it doesn't really retain any hair.
3,Does not catch hair.
3,"At first, I thought they seemed great. Comfy. They’re a great size. However, after just a week, they’re become pretty uncomfortable. I’m not sure what it is. They seem a little too firm for my liking. Hurts my back and neck. ): I really wanted to like these pillows, but it’s a little disappointing."
3,Seem to be just so so for the price.
3,Extremely firm
3,Decent quality but lacking in that “hotel fluffiness”
3,Too thin for comfort/sleep
3,The pills were good for a week and then they lost there shape and fullness. Not worth all the money we spent on buying 4 of them.
3,These pillows are fluffy and great to sleep on but not cool at all.
3,Not as firm as expected
3,not a cooling pillow
3,It is too soft!
3,The pillows don’t seem to be very cooling.
3,Pillow gets hot. Losing support after a few months
3,It was supposed to be a set of two pillows but was sent only one pillow 😒
3,Not enough filling.
3,"When you lay your head on it, it goes nearly flat."
3,Appeared soft and fluffy. However it was not very soft and was very lumpy. After three months we ditched them.
3,Pillows were not soft and were too hot for me.
3,One of the pillows came very flat and will not fluff up even after a week. Don’t think I would buy them again.
3,Pillow isOut .of shape already
3,"The support is terrible, they came rolled up so I let them sit out as directed for 24hrs and fluffed vigorously as directed... they only expanded a little bit and are still just as flat as my old pillows. King size pillow with very little stuffing inside."
3,not wat I expected
3,If I put 2 in one case it sort of works... way too soft for me.
3,It's a very ok pillow. Nothing special. Gets flat easily and doesn't pop back up. Waking up with neck hurting. Don't see what the hype is all about.
3,"Pillow is somewhat firm, which as side sleepers we were looking for, but I don't find it ""cooling"" whatsoever, and neither did my husband."
3,Not what I thought
3,Paid $50 and only received one pillow
3,Very thingDoes not deserve the price
3,Not thick enough. More stuffing needed.
3,It's Ok. It's a pillow.
3,There are the exact size of the standard pillows I am replacing.  I would rate them higher if they were larger.
3,"I can’t sleep on it. My husband uses it as his pillow that he holds while he sleeps, but he can’t sleep on it either."
3,They’re just ok.
3,Not exactly what I’m looking for. Very soft
3,Thought these pillows were cooling but they are not.  They do keep there shape and are extremely soft.
3,Not firm enough
3,Pillows is soft and has the cooling but falls short in expectation as it is very flat snd both have to be used.
3,Thinner than they appear in the picture
3,These pillows were supposed to be firm and they are not.
3,"The cover is okay, but the material is not as thick as some mattress covers.  Also, the cover ends at the top edges of the mattress.  The material that runs along the sides of the mattress is a thin elastic material to hold the cover in place, but it offers no protection from spills."
3,Makes the mattress feel much firmer than without it. Has a rough feel to it and is a hassle to dry after washing because it holds moisture.
3,Washed it a handful of times but still urine seeps they to new mattress.
3,"Product listing claims that this mattress protector is waterproof, but our puppy peed on bed & the urine penetrated the mattress protector & stained the mattress cover. So NOT 100% waterproof."
3,"This was one of the top items for King mattress pad search.  It arrived and it is a mattress protector.  My fault for not seeing that detail before purchase, but just want to make others aware."
3,Very thin yet to see if it is stain proof
3,Ripped after a week of using it
3,"It doesn’t stay on the bed, doesn’t offer full protection."
3,"Protective, but could be softer."
3,It made our mattress 10x hotter and we always wake up sweating even in the winter.
3,Not know.
3,Just ok. Nothing to write home about.
3,It will not tighten up to where all of the wrinkles come out of it.
3,It is little bit thin.
3,It makes me feel hot
3,Not the best product out there but for guest room is just fine.
3,It isn’t tight enough so it keeps slipping around the mattress.
3,lets 30% water thru the fabric
3,"Thinner than I expected, have not washed it yet, so maybe update this review"
3,Is NOT WATER RESISTANT! My son used the bathroom and it went right through. Would return but it’s all pissy
3,Water was still able to go through.
3,It’s not what I thought it would be. It doesn’t zip up at the bottom and it’s not stain resistant.
3,not very waterproof.
3,Not what I was expecting. It is much thinner than the other two I have purchased.
3,This product is okey for it’s price.
3,It’s quiet
3,Works.
3,Did not use for potty training
3,Caused too much sweating.
3,"Wasn’t a fan. The sheet being flannel is too warm, the plastic underside made it slippery on the mattress"
3,"It doesn’t “breathe,it caused me to have night sweats."
3,Protection of expensive mattress
3,Very thin but the size fits my king size mattress
3,Just realized that this was the reason I've been sleeping hot on my memory foam mattress.Memory foam sleeps hot in general and this makes my back burn when i sleep.
3,Move to much from the mattress
3,"Bought the king sized version of this for a memory foam mattress.  I was told that memory foam beds are much warmer/hotter than traditional mattresses.... they were right.  I was told that this protector adds to the ""hot"" experience...  it did.  I am now looking for a permeable protector...  one that breathes."
3,To early to make a comment
3,It slips off my mattress
3,It’s fits my twin xl.
3,Seems ok.
3,Na
3,To make these pillows plump I had to add quite a lot of addl filler.
3,Title
3,"These pillows are so thin! Even after running them in the dryer with a tennis ball, they barely fill out the pillowcase."
3,Not enough filling in the pillows. Too flat and cannot hold shape.
3,"Stock pictures showed its more plush and fully, but the real deal is very flat. I opened the bag so I have to keep it but will buy the different one soon."
3,"These are very thin and flimsy, don’t even fill up pillow shams"
3,I purchased these to use with decorative shams but they need to be a little more firm and not lumpy.
3,Too thin. Soft though.
3,This pillow is flat.
3,I anticipated a much more lofty pillow. These are soft….very soft.
3,They are right size for throw pillows an the covers u got separately.
3,Not fluffy.
3,"Not very full. Said that they would fluff up throughout the first week,  they didn't."
3,I thought it would be firmer
3,Didn’t fluff up much. Shipping box was big enough that it really wasn’t necessary to vacuum seal the pillows.
3,Made my pillows look extremely flat
3,Really smaller than I thought. Should have measured.
3,They don't stay fluffy the go flat after a few days of using them
3,"These inserts are actually kind of flat and not very firm. I ended up having to buy four and placed two in each pillow case before I had decent throw pillows. But they are priced cheap, so about what you can expect."
3,Not as large as advertised and not very full.
3,Doesn't puff out the cushion cover enough. For the price i thought they would be premium and they are not
3,Not blump enoughLike the softness
3,They are much thinner than expectedIt took two of these pillows to partially fill my cases.
3,Pillows are not full. Very thin and flimsy and never fluffed up.
3,Kinda cheap parts
3,This went crooked a couple months in and has had a little lean to the back right.  I have to spray lube into it every few months to get rid of the loud creaking that occurs whenever I shift weight.  I've just tolerated it for years but now that I'm working from home and in the thing all day I will be replacing it.  It has served its purpose.
3,Much much smaller than anticipated. But it’s a decent chair for the price.
3,It's cheap so don't expect too much.Pretty stiff. Cheaply made.
3,"Use this product at my home desk .Just not enough  in the seat,  you tend to sit in  a hole going downeard."
3,Fact that chair does not stay in locked in chosen heighth position!
3,Thin material with little padding. I couldnt imagine more than 1 hour in this chair.  Cheap.
3,Started to fall apart less than a year after purchase -at that time it has been used the equivalent of 8 month of 2/3 hours per day use.  Then it completely disintegrated when COVID-19 time came and it got subjected to daily use for a couple of months.
3,The chair is very small and basic
3,It was much smaller than I expected.
3,When I was shopping for a chair I read a review of how after a couple weeks this chair leaned to one side. Shoulda paid attention.
3,Not intended for obese people
3,After unboxing and assembling the chair is smaller than expected and it didn’t tilt backs
3,LOOKS CHEAP
3,"Maybe it's just me, but after a month one of the armrests got a crack, and a few months later it cracked completely apart."
3,The chair is not very comfortable. The seat is not very well padded. I put a chair pillow on the seat and it is tolerable now. My biggest complaint is I ordered a brown chair but they sent me a BLACK one. I needed the chair so I did not return it. This is a budget chair so it would surprise me if it is still functioning in a couple years but when you don't have much money you sort of have to make due.
3,"The magnetic wheels dont work,i kept fallint off the chair"
3,"If you are not broke, unlike me, spend more money and buy a better chair. This chair is uncomfortable to sit on. I regret buying it. I will force myself to use it I guess."
3,I should have well-noted the first Q&A.  The maximum height of the vertical-adjust makes the seat 21 inches off the ground.  That is not very high.
3,"Very thin padding, this won’t last long"
3,Smaller than expected and not sturdy
3,Very cheaply made. Dosent hold ot of weight.
3,Way smaller than expected
3,With a little tweaking the shelves can work out. I painted the backside of them to give them a seal because I'm made out of that material that can fall apart when it is close to moisture and I'm using this in my bathroom. So far they're staying together. They bow with a lot of weight.
3,Much smaller than I expected in height
3,Looks cheap but serves it's purpose.
3,"The plastic poles don't thread too well and this leads to some pretty flimsy shelves.  If it's in a low traffic area with no adventure-seeking cats it will serve its purpose just fine, but if you need something sturdier keep shopping."
3,Wood was chipped.
3,Too small for the price
3,The shelves are particle board.  That’s not visible in the photos.  Storing anything heavy on particle board causes it to sag.  These are decent light duty shelves.
3,Not sturdy enough
3,plants
3,It was scuffed up a bit
3,Despite tightening as much as possible the structure seems flimsy.
3,Decent product
3,Very cheaply made. Cracks and chips as if it was used. I use ot to hold my sons board games so it works. I wouldn't put too much weight on it!
3,it wobble
3,It was smaller than I expect and not sturdy.
3,Very wobbly
3,"Should have guessed based on the price, but these shelves are incredibly flimsy.  All made out of cheap plastic, don’t expect it to hold much weight"
3,Very small for the price
3,It was not as sturdy. But it worked for my need.
3,Not sturdy at all
3,I expected item to be bigger
3,Way smaller then i thought.
3,"Im using this in a basement storage, its very cheap, not very durable for heavier items, but it'll serve its purpose. I would not put this where others could see it. It looks cheap."
3,Not what I expected!  It looks cheap and doesn’t have the capacity I needed.
3,"cheap plastic, can't handle weight"
3,It arrived with two chipped edges.
3,Was putting it together and I had a long pole snap on me while I was twisting it in.
3,It looks bigger on site. It will do the job for now. We needed a utility shelf and this is a little smaller than expected. More of a livingroom or office shelf
3,"Very flimsy, but functional...."
3,Max weight per shelf is 15 lbs. Entire piece is made of compressed wood and plastic.
3,Its a little on the wobbly side. I wouldn’t buy it to place very much on the upper shelves or anything very heavy on it at all.
3,Wobbly
3,Small and a little fragile
3,"very wobbly. definately needs to be anchored to wall in several places. its lightweight, so dont plan on books or very many electronics,even while anchored."
3,It is made cheep. Didn’t expect plastic very unsteady
3,Check the dimension before purchasing.
3,Not very sturdy. Buy something else
3,"Not sturdy, but did it’s job for holding my makeup and perfume. I would not put anything heavy on it."
3,It is wobbly.
3,Product came cracked
3,when we moved it a part of the desk fell off
3,It will get the job done.......But don't expect this desk to hold up very long if your kid is doing home schooling.
3,was smaller than i thought it might be but it works!
3,It didn’t come with instructions
3,Cheap man made particle wood.
3,It was really sturdy after being out together
3,Smaller than I expected.
3,Not durable
3,Cheaply made. Desk is wobbly already and even when I tighten it it still loosens. Would not reccomend.
3,Much smaller than expected. This is more for a child than office furniture for an adult.
3,Small desk for small areas. It will serve its purpose but it isn't durable. Cheaply made.
3,It’s not water proof
3,"This very small, it is a kids size"
3,Not quite durable.
3,Paint peels off.
3,"The pre drilled holes were drilled out a little too big, so we had to get bigger screws than the ones provided. Other than that it seems to be okay."
3,Very small. Not very sturdy. I don’t think it’ll hold up when we move.
3,Had to return it. The desk has a weight limit and my Mac and printer exceeded the limit
3,I used I for school
3,"I returned this the next day. The desk arrived, and as soon as I opened it, it had visible scratches on every surface I could see."
3,"It was way smaller than i thought. Im only 5""1 and still feel stuffed when sitting."
3,Instructions for assembly were not sufficient.
3,Loud but for this price what you can expect .
3,Ya it functions and all but it don’t push much air at all.
3,See headline
3,This fan is great until it stopped working. We changed the fuse but it did not help.
3,"The older model might have been louder, but it blew a lot more air."
3,It does the job
3,"Not enough power, especially for a Honeywell product."
3,I gave it 3 stars because it doesn't blow very much air even on high. It is very quiet though!
3,I sleep with a fan year-round for the sound on high this thing barely makes a noise I don't like
3,"Not a lot of power even on the highest level,"
3,Not work as expected nor needed.
3,Bought 2 and they both died after 1+years. Other than that they’re fantastic!
3,Moves air but its loud.
3,Look at my profile pic
3,Doesn't angle down. Only forward to the facing up position.  We need the down direction as many would.
3,Hardly hear it
3,I was looking for more white noise...so quite.
3,If it blew harder on high would of been 5 stars
3,Loud noise
3,It’s too working anymore. Only had it for a couple of months
3,It is smaller than I thought.Buyer beware
3,"It does the job of heating a room, but I need something quiet as I wanted to use this in my office and I am on video/audio calls all day. This is loud enough that my system actually reminds me I'm on mute because it thinks I'm trying to say something. I'll return it but for some folks looking for something small and efficient where the noise is irrelevant it could work."
3,"Makes a lot of noise.  Much louder than the Lazlo heater, but Lazlo quit working after four months."
3,Heats the space but is much louder than other heaters of the same size.
3,"Really loud, gets hot though"
3,"Sometimes it does not turn off with thermostat, wake up to a hot room"
3,Too loud!
3,Does not put out that much heat unless you are very close to it. It really does not heat up the very small room I have.
3,I’ve had this heater for a year and two weeks. It quit working today. The warranty was for a year.  : (
3,Heats well but fan wasn't very powerful if I remember right. I did return it
3,"It says it has a thermostat, but it's just an up or down dial that leaves you to guess where to set it for a particular temp."
3,Not as big as I thought
3,I used this product for heat but it blows cold air from the back always
3,Doesn’t shut off automatically
3,Loud and heat control isn’t much to brag about.
3,"Nice size, gives off decent amount of heat... but control doesn’t seems to change much. Cannot use while teaching online  because it is noisy...:(  Cannot hear my kids."
3,Didn’t heat the room I think the room may have been too big for this output.
3,Test
3,"Takes a while to heat up room but it does end up heating the overall room in about 30 minutes! Heat is not directly felt, blast radius is not far! Need to be really close in order to feel!"
3,Gets hot enough but thermostat does not operate as described.  Also much louder than expected.
3,To small
3,Puts out much less heat than another heater I had with same rating.
3,The first heater broke so i ordered another one. It doesnt output much heat its good for a very small room.
3,will heat only small area.
3,It is very loud but heats the bathroom adequately
3,"Not as quiet as expected, but reasonable."
3,Had the return the heater after trying to get rid of the heavy chemical smell for two weeks.
3,"Although it works fine, it is quite noisy"
3,Very noise!!!
3,Doesn’t put out much air even on the highest speed
3,You can have quiet or a lot of air but not both.
3,"Good fan great price but not ""whisper"" quiet. It's not loud or anything and I'm a light sleeper firist part and can still fall asleep to it but it's not as quiet as I thought. I have to turn up my tv every time its on and unless its very hot I'll turn it off just to not listen to it anymore."
3,Noise level is higher than expected.
3,Loud. Even louder when on oscillation mode
3,Not a lot of power for Caribbean summer
3,"It’s louder than I thought it would be. Attaching the base wasn’t hard, but I did end up putting it on backwards despite reading the directions."
3,It doesn't take up much space but the highest setting feels like it would be the lowest on other Lasko fans
3,This fan was disappointing. it works but the level of air is laughable in comparison to other fans.
3,Only lasted 3 months
3,Mixed silicone by weight. Couldn't get it to weight the same equal size pour. Accuracy just isn't there.
3,"This scale is much smaller than I expected, including the buttons and display screen.  Feels rather cheap. It even gave me a reading of .4 grams,  Right out the box!  I reset it and it still did the same thing, so I returned it."
3,"Bought for the intention of weighing reptiles, but its a little too small for my animal container for weigh in times.Will have to use this for cat food instead."
3,To small comparing with the price I return
3,Works.
3,"This scale is ok. It is veryTemperamental, sometimes it works, sometimes it does not."
3,scale is not accurate tested it with a 5 gram weight it weighed 4 grams on this scale. off by about 20%
3,"It is not waterproof, small for kitchen use, accuracy is 3-5 grams minimum"
3,So light and cheaply made. Uses battery
3,I think I got a faulty item. Mine won’t turn on and I just received it today. (Yeah I have batteries)
3,The whole scale is to sensitive. And was about .5 off when I used it
3,"After 5 months, I can't use tare button. It's just not working."
3,NOT GETTINT THE READINGS I NEED HUM MAYBE I'M NOT QUITE FAMILARE WITH IT
3,Accurate scale but any normal plate or bowel covers the screen and you can't read the weight.
3,Not balance!
3,really small
3,🍑
3,I had to return this because it didnt weigh the small amounts i needed
3,"This scale is very slick looking in the stainless style, but the design makes it so you cannot see the reading. For instance even a small plate covers the reading, as it is a small flat square, with the read out on the square."
3,The numbers tend to jump around a lot and I can never quite zero it out. The numbers change all the time.
3,I’ve been doing candle making the past few months and have not been able to measure and get the scale to read exactly 16oz. It is always 16.01oz. Therefore I believe it is not 100% as accurate as it should be. Aside from that it measures and its small and portable.
3,Not accurate but not expensive maybe I didn’t know how to use it
3,"My scale is not accurate anymore after having it for 4 months. I have used it about 7 times. The numbers are jumpy. The last two times I have tried making soap, my calculations were off because without touching it or moving the scale, it goes from .00 oz to .05 oz back to .00oz repeatedly. It won't stop."
3,The accuracy is fluctuated
3,"The product worked fine for 2 years, but then stopped working, even after replacing the batteries. It stopped being responsive and was unable to zero out."
3,Doesn’t scale exactly right. It really only scales swell in increments of 2 grams (not odd numbers for some reason). Gets the job done though for a low price.
3,feels cheap.
3,Very inconsistent
3,So so
3,Not accurate.
3,Malfunction shortly after I got it. I got it for recipes.
3,"Sometimes doesn’t work as expected, gives different measurements for the same thing with the same weight"
3,The product works ok， but the quality is just so so
3,The button is so stiff and sometimes you need to press a few times to get the selection.
3,It's not perfect. It's convenient though. It's good for the price and size.
3,Always round up as it's not always accurate
3,Lacks more instructions
3,"Tried to figure out why all using this, still had to cook and then put in crock, why then??"
3,1
3,Not working as advertised. The slow cooker is not working on it
3,The right size is complicated to operate
3,Complicated understand and use.Not as simple as I had imagined.
3,Did not get the condensation with my 3QT Nova.
3,It keeps signaling that my food is burning
3,"Every time I cook with it, it always has water spilled all over."
3,"I loved my instant pot so much, but I’ve had it a month and it stopped working."
3,"I would not buy this particular appliance again because the company wrote awful instructions or lack of instructions.I had to call friends and watch youtube videos to get any idea why it works the way it does.  I am not sure I will keep it as it seems to be inconsistent with its operation.  They  must be putting out new models allot because nobody I talked to, a couple of friends who did not have the model I did and all of us are fairly new to Instapot."
3,The product came without a user manual and condensation collector
3,"As an avid user of a conventional pressure cooker, I was hoping this would be a solution when I have extended stays in hotels.  Unfortunately, the 3 qt is just as large as my conventional pressure cooker (10 qt), and slower to pressurize.  I also noticed it takes approximately 30% longer to cook the same meals.  Sadly,  it DOES NOT come with a steaming basket for veggies (cheapest functional steam basket I found was $12) so add that into the price.  It is nice having the delay function, but if I knew then what I know now, I probably would have bought a hot plate instead."
3,👍🏾
3,"After 4 years, it lights on but can’t heat up. I don’t use it often, just once a week only."
3,I have to hold the liver to let the steam out. It is not coming out automatically.
3,I found this very complicated to use.
3,"when arrived, i found scratches on the inner container.As if it was used before."
3,More complex than crockpot
3,"I can cook rice faster on the stove. What was supposed to make life easier, made life more difficult."
3,"If you have time to cook, just get a regular kitchen.If you don't have time, but can plan, get a slow cooker instead."
3,Didn’t get measuring cup and spoon to serve
3,It does not have a brown rice setting.
3,"A lot of options, can do a lot, only issue is the pot is not very non-stick. The older pot I had was non stick, this one is not, and it’s an issue."
3,U have to know how to use this thing or it’s a different way of cooking
3,"Too small.  Too complicated.  Byvtge time it heats up, do it on the stove.  A crock pot is much simpler."
3,Cups are rather small. May work for others.
3,I did not use it for a while. It overheats quickly. Just burned today.Will try another product.
3,"Not all that , you’d be blending for a long while. And still not all the way blended"
3,Its works for the mean time but if your looking for something permanent you may have to invest in something more sustainable
3,Smaller than i thought
3,Smoothies only and had to replaced with a regular blender.
3,It was average . Thought would be used more. Just average
3,Smallest than it looks and cups are small; for this price you can get larger one at Walmart.
3,The blender tends to have a burning smell
3,"This is a very small Magic Bullet. Micro Bullet, I just was not expecting it to be so tiny."
3,I put frozen fruit and milk in my blendor and it takes a really long to actually blend I have to mix it often to get the job done
3,Too less for price
3,I've purchased this product twice and use it daily for a blended matcha drink. The first lasted three years the second lasted a year.
3,"It was said that in can do for example onions, but in reality, it can't at all, neither big chunks nor small ones, unless you add water or sth juicy to it!"
3,"I was scared the item was broke , because the box it came in was messed up.looks like someone had stepped on it, but it was ok"
3,Pockets are very tight money clip does not hold much cash
3,"A bit larger than expected, money clip is really tight, can only hold a few bills."
3,There is nothing slim about this wallet  at all.
3,Just feels cheap
3,I Too many cards NOT enough storage
3,it wasn't as slim as advertised
3,Be side the money clip I thought you would be able to use the regular way to put your money in the bill fold the regular way!!
3,כ
3,"When I went to register my purchase the QR code link they sent was out or date or discontinued. At any rate, it did not work. I am not sure I see this wallet as a long term solution but maybe my expectations were too high. It seems ok....we'll see how long it lasts."
3,I take my wallet out of my pocket at least 30 times in one shift at work to scan my badge. The corners quickly wore down allowing the outer material to peal.
3,"If you fill the wallet up, it doesn't stay flat.  It opens up into a v, taking up more space.  If you actually use the money clip, the adjacent card slots are very tight, making it difficult to insert or remove cards.  I wanted a small wallet that was easily accessible. This was neither."
3,Way bigger than I expected.
3,I knew it only held 12 cards but I thought it would be a little more flexible instead it’s tight and hard to get more then 1 card in a slot. The money holder was very tight and I had a hard time getting a card in behind the money clip.
3,"For the last several years ive had a very small, almost unnoticeable wallet. I thought thats what this was going to be. But it is much larger than I thought. Its basically a normal size wallet."
3,"It is ""slim"" primarily because you can only carry a few items in it."
3,It’s average quality
3,Already fell apart
3,It was bigger than I anticipated
3,To bulky
3,Not exactly what I expected
3,Wallet was smaller then advertised !
3,"After reloading all stuff from current wallet, it was still a bit too bulky for me."
3,Na
3,There's just not enough room for everything. and it's tight where your cards go.

3,"too early to tell yet, need a new wallet, just have to see if this one fits the bill, so far, maybe not."

3,Too small nothing fits inside
3,I did not like the quality of the material. It was hard to determine in the pictures what the quality would feel like.
3,Great craftsmanship but I bought it for its supposedly sleek and minimalist design.  It failed on both aspects.  It is the same size as a regular wallet but is thinner.  Very well made but not what I was looking for.

3,Very tight and small order a size up
3,"The design on these really is not comfortable.  They feel like you're on the edge of a water slide at the top of a drop. Do not feel like a snug fit, more like a  plastic wrap. Because of this, wicking in key areas is crap too, as is cooling since there's a layer of air between the fabric and skin.Definitely won't be buying any more of this model / type."
3,Had to throw away a pair already because of holes
3,"Overall, the only issue with this is that they're very snug in the leg."

As far as been breathable I’m not sure there is much difference with the non-breathable ones. Also, maybe it’s my impression but the fabric seems to be a little thinner than usual.  I ordered the assorted colors package and didn’t get the colors I chose at the time of the purchase. So I guess “assorted colors” means you get what they send you..."
3,I need my boxer briefs to stay up high so my thighs don't rub together. These did not do that. They keep sliding down my thighs.

3,They don't breathe at all and will cause sweaty feet.
3,I wanted Swede but I couldn’t find it
3,"I’ve been wearing these trainers for about 20 years having bought ~25 pair. The last few pair seem to be breaking down faster with the plastic outsole areas caving in the side rear sections. Also, the soles have been separating. Additionally, this new pair came in a completely obliterated box but they appear to be ‘new’. It might be time for a new shoe and Amazon alternative."
3,"My previous NB shoes lasted over 5 years.  These ones just 1 year, the soles came apart at the heal."
3,I ordered 9 1/2 wide and when I tried them on they looked exactly the same but then I noticed one was made by Nike and the other one by new balance and of course the Nike was a little higher so I returned them both so as not to affect my hip
3,Too slippery too walk on
3,Buy the 626 instead
3,"There seems to be an issue with ""wide"" ND ""xw"" in New Balance shoes. I sent these back and ordered same pair in white. White pair is NOT wide either. Compared to other NB shoes; 411, 608, wide and they are ALL about 1/4 inch wider! Had the 481 XW and these are NOT wide either. Just received a pair of 840 V2 XW and these ARE NOT wide!! Seems that NB thinks 2E is wider than 4E!?"
3,"They advertise these as leather. When we hear that we have visions of soft baseball gloves, cozy couches, top of the line car seats, etc. There is just one thing wrong with the descriptions of these shoes. The leather is not that kind of leather. It is bonded.Bonded leather is the lowest grade of leather, because it is not really leather – just shredded leather scraps and bits reconstituted with a filler and backed with an embossed polyurethane coating. It’s very cheap, but falls apart quickly. Bonded leather is found in low-end furniture and accessories, and sometimes book binding. You may also see this referred to as reconstituted or blended leather.Because these are cheap leather, I do not expect them to last long. In fact, they refuse to break in and get soft at all. Not bad to look at, but if you're expecting the full grain leather or even something soft and malleable, look elsewhere."
3,Made in a different country than the pair previously purchased. Toe is narrow and restrictive.
3,"The pair I got seemed to be factory seconds, but stores were closed due to Covid 19. So had to use"
3,Not near enough cushion in bottm of shoe for me..went from air monarchs to these and going back to monarchs
3,Too tight across the toes
3,Item received as promised.  Unfortunately the model is not as the one advertised.
3,This product wears out too quickly for me. I expect more from New Balance.
3,The New Balance cross trainer is a bit tight for a wide cross trainer. I decided to keep them and will use them at times.
3,"One shoe had a pointed toe, the other has the expected rounded toe. It was too much trouble to return them. Lesson learned. Clearly this pair was not quality checked."
3,Could be wider
3,Shoe was too marrow
3,Sole separates from shoe after about 6 months
3,Feet can’t handle the dress shoes today.I have moved to tennis shoes
3,Very wide!! Would have returned them but through out the box
3,Ordered brown received black. Need brown.
3,Not that durable.  Only lasted 5 months before the stitching started coming undone.
3,They were bought for someone else
3,Shoe ripped at seams after six months of wear.
3,The ad info indicated the 12w was = to a 12 - 4. The shoes that arrived were 12w but the tag has the w = 2. They may loosen a bit with more wear but require a shoehorn to get feet into the shoes.
3,Basic shoes for a basic price
3,Too wide
3,I wear New Balance shoes all of the time and always wear a 10D shoe. I ordered these and the are too narrow. Returning.
3,"Looked for wide shoe, but this was not wide enough."
3,The size was very large
3,recomended
3,"They just seem to run about a half size to big. Besides that, they were ok."
3,Does not have the expected quality.  It is little bit hard as well. I have used for less than a year and it is starting to show signs of aging very quickly. Would not recommend this product for anything other than causal use.
3,Too long in toe area
3,"They're ok, the heel should be tighter."
3,"Not my favorite NB shoe because it is noisy. Comfortable, but I hear every step,"
3,somewhat small
3,Too heavy and inflexible--I use them now (not intended) as work boots.
3,"The shoe is on the small size, and is not comfortable to wear for extended time. Hoping the shoe can stretch enough, so that I am able to wear for extended periods of time."
3,O.K.
3,Size runs big. Had to return and reorder a size smaller
3,"Sent a mens shoe and a womens shoe, so my son cant wear them."
3,These crocs are smaller than the crocs I got from the store
3,Second pair I’ve bought but this time the shoes was larger than actual size
3,Ran a little small! Another trip to the UPS store!
3,The length of time it took to be returned. And the next price went down 5$. n Not again
3,Bigger than expected
3,To big
3,Should have went a size smaller.
3,Size runs big
3,Really need to produce 1/2 sizes!
3,"I ordered the same size as my other crocs expecting these to fit the same. Well I was wrong, they ran significantly smaller and since I assumed they would be fine tossed the packaging etc so I can’t return. I’d recommend sizing up from your normal croc size."
3,"They are so wide for Med, I can't keep them on.Love the look of them, will give them away."
3,I bought these for my son who wears a size 14. They were 2 sizes too big! He didn’t wanna go through the hassle of a return and decided to keep them because he only wears them around the house. Who measures these shoes?? Are these European sizes or what?
3,Wider than i expected but very comfy
3,Just a tad big
3,"Size up! If you are a 7, get a size 8."
3,The size is way too large for the size I bought.
3,The product was not the color I assumed it would be. I thought it would be a bit darker
3,I read the reviews where it said that they run large and to order a size down. My toes are rubbing on the front of the shoes
3,Size up or youl be returning
3,Watch arrived scuffed.
3,"Wore it one time, and the black is already rubbing off of the band. Not the quality I'm used to with Fossil."
3,Too big of a face. Very clunky.
3,"First watched showed up all scratched, ordered a replacement also showed up scratched!"
3,the date timer doesn't work
3,It’s an ok watch nothing special
3,The strap started to peel after a few months of use.
3,Eu kdk
3,Watch is very heavy.
3,Way bigger than all other watches i saw at the store.
3,band came off
3,I received with little scratches
3,"The inside gradient wasn't what I expected, I thought it'd be more ""refine"" looking... the rest is just as the picture"
3,its bigger and heavier than i was expected
3,"Has a little mark in one side, this mark is not for a scratched"
3,This is a very nicely designed watch. The reason for the 3-star review is for the stainless steel wristband. The quality and workmanship of the wristband is poor and that takes away from the watch.
3,it is too large
3,Didn't like. Face was huge. Returned it
3,"The watch came shoved into a metal fossil box.  The band was kinked , and where the kink was it scratched off the surface coating on the band."
3,There are white scratches on the watch.
3,"Nice looking watch. Tired of digital watches, I wanted an old school analog watch. This however doesn't have a backlight and the hands are not lumenescent. At this price, that is unforgivable. The date display is also tiny. Overpriced for what you get."
3,Betrry is not working and glass is some scracth
3,Some scratch are there!!
3,I got this product from Ethos watches. The case of the watch was an old one with few scratches on it. Also the watch didn't look to be a brand new. There were few patches. I wanted to return the product but I had to use that product so couldn't.
3,Looks cheap
3,"The dial is great but the band is very bad, doesnt look or feel as nice in person."
3,SAA
3,It wasn't the color I wanted
3,So far so good....dates needs be shown with contrast color. And all dials should glow at night.
3,Product received good but the packing from amazon is not good as expected.
3,"The pictures depict the face with all silver details.  However, there is actually quite a bit of gold rather than silver.  I thought it looked cheezy and a bit cheap.Returned."
3,Too big
3,The leather band color is a bit off.
3,The watch didnt come with the tags!!B
3,Smaller than i thought. Felt cheap too
3,Not expected quality
3,I didn't get warranty card with proper stamp and also any bill with this 😑
3,The product delivered is not working. Replacement made.
3,"Very large face, takes some getting used to"
3,Strap color is different and looks cheap.
3,Avg
3,Watch looks great but the sharp edges where strap attaches to the face cut into wrist
3,Looking not branded
3,"Average product from fossil,Returned"
3,The leather changed color quickly
3,Watch is very classic.. but back panel is very sharp
3,I got another model instead of it.
3,Dial is not blue..It's black
3,Color was totally different from the picture
3,"Not a bad looking watch. My only complaint is, that if i dont wear it everyday the watch stops. Its meant to be an everyday wear."
3,"The actual watch is fine and is performing well at this time ,There is nothing wrong with the band ,but it fdoes dig into my wrist sometimes ,prefer leather bands anyway which makes no sense on a diver watch"
3,The cyclops is off a hair.
3,Returned. It was too small for my husband. Next time I must pull out the measureing tape.
3,Does not keep accurate time. I have had to reset time several times.
3,"Keeps time 1 or 2 minutes fast each day. In a week where it started on time,  it will be 10 to 15 minutes at end of that week."
3,Pin fell out of the clasp after wearing for a month. Bracelet is not covered under warranty.
3,They looks to cheap even for 90$ .
3,"Keeps time well. Perfect size for my wrist, doesn't look like I'm carrying a spare tire on my wrist likey last watch.Edit: after almost 2 months the glass starting fogging up real bad and it doesn't tell time anymore."
3,It's smaller than I thought it would be.
3,The bracelet feel cheap
3,cheap crystal should be sapphire
3,Very large band. Had to remove to links.
3,The watch is very accurate. The luminous dial doesn't last more than a few minutes after  being placed in direct sunlight for a few hours.
3,dont expect too much....the needles and dial quality is ...hm.....it just looks cheap.....very cheap...
3,"This watch is a little slow at first, but after two years it is so slow you can not rely on it.  It is in my sock drawer and I dont wear it anymore.  Went and bought a Casio."
3,"I ordered this and another Invicta at the same time (8926), this was not what I got. What I got was a 8926A and a 8926. I can't even find the 8926A on Ivicta's web site. The only difference I can find in the 2 is the coin edge on one, both are 40MM"
3,I have to reset time and date several times
3,Quite heavy!
3,"I bought this watch for swimming and diving in the Caribbean where I spend 6 months of the year.This is the 3rd watch I am trying.The first 2 had faults, the 1st was losing time over a few days. The 2nd also was losing time but over a week.I  now on my 3rd which is working very well so far. I haven't been in water with it yet because of the pandemic I can't leave for my Caribbean swim to test it."
3,But not the big and heavy we use to see in invicta
3,It’s quite small for me
3,it is o.k
3,Lasted about 2 years
3,"doesn't keep the time, you sleep and it sleeps with you"
3,"Pretty simple, however it kinda irritates my worst a little bit, however for the price it’s a good watch"
3,Plastic junk
3,Cheap locks. Probably won’t deter theft. You can’t set a combo
3,not very theft proof
3,"Can't reset combination, have to use the one it comes with."
3,Set combination that cant be customized. You must rememer the combination that came with yhe lock.
3,"Description said we could change the combination, but you can’t."
3,It’s ok. Kinda thin.  I can’t choose to change the combination either.
3,Smaller than they looked on the website. Couldn't set a combo and bought 4 of them so sent them back and upgraded.
3,cannot change the lock code
3,Very picky lock mechanism
3,"Perhaps I should’ve read the description more closely, but the numbers go from 1 to 6. Makes it much harder to come up with a combo that I can remember"
3,"Works fine,but way shorter than I thought"
3,It works
3,"It is much smaller than I expected, but then much lighter than the second one I bought from a store."
3,"cheap lock, can kick open"
3,Too small.
3,as expected
3,"Cheaply built , but does what it is supposed to do !"
3,As advertised and able to lock up 4bikes side by side. Lock mechanism seems rather cheap though.
3,This lock is mostly just a visual deterrent. It's not very high quality and is very basic in functionality (you can't choose your combination) but it will keep someone from walking off without your bike without any effort.
3,The product I received had its insulation starting to come off on one end.
3,ssomewhat small
3,Decent lock but seems to stick sometimes
3,Does not seem very high quality.
3,"this is way smaller than I expected, its about as thin as a pencil however I gave it three stars because of price and shipping"
3,"You can tell why its cheap. The lock looks fragile and the parts seem to be a bit loosen, but it does the job"
3,Too small
3,this is a really small bike lock
3,Haven't used it.  Instructions are in Chinese.
3,I thought this would have a clip to fasten it to my scooter as did the one I had before.
3,the locking mechanism is a little flimsy.
3,Got this and another brand- this one is thinner and can't be reprogrammed with your own code. It will do the job but I'd spend a bit more to not have to remember a code and for the added deterrent of a thicker cable.
3,Okey.
3,Works for a quick pickup.
3,Caliber is too thin.
3,the chain is not very long
3,It is less weight than I expectef
3,would not real buy it
3,Does the job.
3,Cheap deterrent
3,it is very wound as in it coils up way 2 much but it will serve its purpose
3,Standard master
3,"It's cheap, don't expect much"
3,"I’d describe these as the base model. They get the job done, but do not have features that other similar lanterns have like magnets or a hanging clip. Also, these are not as bright as others I’ve seen."
3,It was actually smaller then I thought.  I didn’t think to too at the measurements..just looking t what it could possible deliver.
3,One of the light doesn't close which causes it to stay on.
3,Thought it would be bigger
3,These are very small
3,Batteries were corroded
3,One would not shut off. The other worked as it should
3,Uses batteries instead of rechargeable
3,To small
3,Way smaller than mine thought
3,Output is about a 40 watt bulb.
3,These lanterns are comically small
3,"These little light's are wonderfully bright and easy to use but, when I opened the packagenone lamp worked and the other did not. I tried using other batteries than the one's sent with the light's but it still wouldn't work. 😟 sadly I have only one that works. Probably wont buy again knowing they are faulty before use."
3,One doesn’t work
3,"Came in a pack of 2.  One lantern turns off as advertised, the other does not."
3,One works great!......the other not so much it won’t shut off when you close it so you have to take the batteries out.
3,One of the lanterns works as designed. The other one will not close properly and the light never shuts off. Had to take the batteries out to shut it off.
3,I didn’t realize these were so small
3,"Ordered two 2-packs for Christmas Presents.  Three of four lanterns worked.  One wouldn't turn off when closed.Amazon sent a replacement.  But, returns are a nuisance.  So, I subtract hassle points."
3,One of the lamps I recieved was flawed. When batteries are inserted the lamp remains on and does not turn off.The other one recieved works flawlessly and lights up the area really well.
3,It works and will probably only work for a short time before it becomes landfill.
3,Bought two and they came with batteries. Each light has three banks of white LEDs. Each bank has two rows. The batteries go in the bottom.One of the lamps had one bank inserted poorly in the internal frame. Ten minutes to take it apart and fix it.
3,One of the lights did not work. A section of the lED did not work. Had to return item
3,Ordered 4 lights and 2 came cracked on the bottom door that unscrew to install batteries. Need them for night fishing and had to tape them up to keep battery cover on.
3,Much smaller than anticipated
3,"Only when starting directly at it.  For the number of LED's, really does not fill a small area very well.  Will be sufficient in my medium size tent, but if hung near the top, there is no light going down.  Should have 4 rows of lights instead of 3, light patterns do not overlap.  So OK, and good for the cost, just was a bit disappointing."
3,Used once
3,"Handles are too sorry,needs to be thicker or padded."
3,Don’t know about the battery life yet.  I use them around my smoker at this time of year due to not having as long sunlight.
3,"They're nice little lights but I do find the LED far too bright, it hurt the eyes."
3,"I would have given 5 stars but one whole light strip on of the lanterns doesn't work, so only two of the three sides lights up."
3,1 works 1 doesn't
3,"I thought they were going to be a little bit larger in size, and put out a little bit more light. But all in all they are convenient & will do the job."
3,too led rbight
3,"Really liked the product, however, by the time we got the chance to use the lights, we noticed that one of them was shipped to us broken. The internal switch that turns off the light when it is closed was broke off and you could hear it rattling around inside the light. The only way to turn it off now is to remove the batteries. By the time we used the lights, we were outside of the return window.Just make sure that when you get these, you check them out first thing. Lesson learned the hard way for us."
3,The bag strap tore the first time I used it
3,Had to return it due to its weight. I could not carry it.
3,The armrests side down in back when you text your arms.  Bag ripped when we tried to put the chair back in the bag.
3,Didn't even last a day and the thing fell apart
3,Sturdy but a little heavy to carry around.
3,The color was closer to a pink
3,As above. Returned it
3,STARTED TO GIVE OUT ON ME @ 210 LBS.
3,"It is not comfortable if you have normal sized legs. The seat is angled up, cinches the hamstrings above the knee and cuts circulation. I can’t sit in this chair for more than 5 mins without my legs falling asleep (due to circulation being restricted).The front support pieces for the arm rests reduce the available seating space as well, further constricting the body. This chair might sturdy and durable, but in terms of ergonomics it’s poorly designed."
3,The fabric on the chair arm ripped after just 2 uses
3,i only used the chair once. It was too heavy for me to carry as well as awkward.In order to store it in my small apartment I had to tie rope around it in two locations in order to get it back into its storage sleeve.I am 81 years of age and live alone in a small apartment.
3,Weighs a ton!
3,"I would give it 5 but it was late by three days and i needed for a camping trip but couldn't bring them because they weren't at my house in time, the day  i got home from camping that was the day it was delivered but i will just use them anyway for car shows"
3,Impossible to get back into bag.  Not bd chairs otherwise.
3,I guess it's not sturdy enough for bigger people. The frame is bending on me fairly quick...
3,Rivet that holds the material to the back rest pole fell off after only two months.
3,Almost impossible to get entire chair back into the bag!
3,"I have used this chair at my daughter's swim meets.I think it was used 30 times at most, last week one of the corners ripped and it was unusable.I will not buy this product again."
3,Kinda small.
3,"The chair is very comfortable, but the bag ripped the first day. It ripped in the seam. It is a very thin flimsy bag. I will have to return unless the seller will send me a new bag. Not sure how to contact Coleman."
3,Wearing out quickly
3,This chair fell apart after the first year I had it.
3,"When you adjust The arms on the chair,they keep sliding down. It will not stay in place"
3,Not what I expected
3,Carpel tunnel syndrome
3,Meh...it was ok.
3,Go try things on before you eyeball the product that you're thinking about.  This gapped and wasn't as described.
3,Bulkier than anticipated
3,I'm an average sized woman and these were way too big for me.
3,Difficult to make a tight fit. Need assistance to hold it while tightening.
3,It is difficult to secure the Velcro without assistance
3,Shop around
3,Sweat smell😷
3,Too big for my small wrist. Will be returning.
3,only receive one brace
3,Didn’t work as expected.
3,Too big for my hand/wrist.
3,The fabric starts to rip under heavy use after a while.
3,Need two hands to put it on properly
3,Velcro doesn't stay fastened after a couple of months usage.
3,"The thumb hole is small, making it very uncomfortable to wear. My hands are very small, and it's still uncomfortable for me. Other than that, it provides good wrist support."
3,Easy to adjust. However it’s a little bit too thick so it’s not comfortable at all.
3,Only use during warm weather. Our zippers keeps getting stuck halfway and coming off track. In addition the zipper fabric is deteriorating after a few days of use.
3,Very large vents on 2 sides that are not closable make this unusable in temps below 40degrees.
3,returned
3,Used when it lightly rained and inside got completely wet!
3,The tent sticks were very brittle.
3,There one I got was damaged and used. Think it can be a reality good one if I got a new one
3,it only fits one person not two
3,I got this last year for $53. Hmm PRICE GOUGE?
3,A little flimsy but it works.
3,The elastic cord inside the support rod broke.
3,"Had a year in it.when we set it up we seen, where the window mesh meets the tent meterial , it wasn't seen together"
3,"Water did get in. It was a thunder storm but I seen it coming through the seam. But for the price, I expected it."
3,"If using inflatable mattress, only fits one single. Perhaps one twin."
3,"While it is the right size and brand, I was really looking for a tent where all of the windows zipped closed instead of relying on the rain cover.  It will work, but not what I thought that I was buying."
3,Walls of mesh
3,Tent arrived in one piece - barely. The box was completely opened and dismantled. The tape holding the box together was stripped halfway off.
3,"average quality, poles seem very fragile."
3,Not rain proof
3,haven't
3,Not waterproof!!! In a rainstorm you must use a tarp!
3,Tent leaks when rain gets heavy
3,Lid leaks a little and perspiration gets on lid making it wet if there’s ice inside.
3,"One band, very little resistance"
3,That were smaller than I thought
3,The loops are too small.
3,3 of the bands have always busted within weeks of using them.
3,Excercise
3,My husband has been using the yellow band and it busted on him during a workout last week.
3,These are not for thick thighs. They start above my knees end up mid-calf in seconds. But they work in every other way.
3,Not right wnough
3,Durability could be better- the first band broke after 1 use
3,"Not what I was looking for, the resistance give way about halfway through pulling it."
3,"These are fine. They are good for the price (4.99) but if you are a serious band user and exercise regularly you'll quickly discover these have limited use. They need to be more snug for exercises that require placement on the thighs - they slide down constantly because they are cut too wide. Plus while it claims to offer a range of resistance by providing so many bands, they are all more or less light to medium. I ended up giving these away and buying the brand I used before but is three times the price."
3,The bands are pretty narrow and flimsy and easily roll up making them more annoying than useful.  I spent half my workout trying to keep them from rolling.  The heaviest bands were better but not what I needed for some PT foe hip issues.
3,Inexpensive but didn't last long.
3,Didn't last long
3,Regular
3,Too flimsy
3,"They work decently, but they roll"
3,These rolls with your work out. They're a little flimsy. But they work.
3,"The product is ok, but not what I’d hoped for.  They are much smaller in size than I had anticipated.  I thought they’d have been bigger.  I am using two of the bands regularly to strengthen my foot."
3,The bands are too thin and too small (circumference). But...better than some out there.
3,"I like the quick delivery. I don't like that the bands are thin and stretch too much. I expected to get the type that I used at my former fitness gym. Instead, I'm using only the black one, which is the heaviest weight. The other color bands lack resistance."
3,They roll up on your legd
3,They cause me to itch and the rubber stinkd..
3,The bands are to thin and aren’t durable
3,Bands are very small
3,"There is not a whole lot of stretch to these bands, but they get the job done for the basics."
3,They rolled around quite a bit
3,I'm using them to keep my ankle weights on
3,Very small and cheap.
3,As expected
3,These are not like most bands very thin and okay if you have never used bands
3,Not made for big thighs at all
3,Rolls Up
3,I bought these and I realized that with time they ripped apart I didn't even use them a lot. Invest in thicker bands.
3,Exercise!
3,This product was too weak compare to the others ones that I have tried.Although it comes in all different sizes and colors which makes easy to differentiate.
3,I thought the heavier bands would have more resistance
3,Too thin!!!Rolls down
3,They roll down constantly
3,I had to buy a different set from another shop. These ones kept rolling up on me. Indo have thick thighs. Just didn't work for me
3,Bands tend to roll up while completing a work out. Gets the job done but lots of time spent repositioning.
3,"I thought they would be a bit longer, but I would make them work."
3,Bands often slip and do not stay in place
3,"I think the bands are a little to large and not tight enough.  I am a big person (6'3"") and I find the bands to be too loose and too weak.  I wish they were stronger and tighter."
3,Waiting to hear if there is a replacement coming.....
3,"I have these for about 6 months now. I only use the red and black. Occasionally I use the yellow for arms. I, so far had no issues. Yes, the lightweight ones do roll up. The heavier ones less and it really depends on the exercise. To avoid rolling as well as to improve some excercises I use different heavy bands for legs. None of them snapped on me yet. I do make sure to put some baby powder on them so they don’t stick. Be careful of asbestos in baby powder. Try getting those based on cornstarch rather than talc"
3,Slips up automatically after i put it on.
3,I purchased these in April. I only use two or three for simple upper body exercises three times a week. Two of them split and one split completely apart while in use. I have sent emails to the company and have not gotten a response .
3,Keeps sliding off my legs. But other than that it does the job.
3,These will work if you're new to working out but they don't provide the same amount of resistance as some other brands.
3,It ain't too shabby
3,One size does not fit all.  The brace is not made for larger people.  Probably works well for a smaller body type.
3,Doesn’t seem to make a change in standing tall as expected.  Because u have it on it is a reminder to stand tall but doesn’t make a difference for me
3,I am not able to get this on.
3,It works but not that great. I thought that it would be a little more strong I guess.
3,It does not stay in place
3,"Positive, is I could feel a slight pull to straighten my back. But negative is it is not comfortable the Velcro rubs right under the armpits and it would be better for a strap support across chest."
3,No pain relief.
3,This brace basically just pull your shoulders back. It don’t really help slouching. You will still slouch just with your shoulders pulled back. If the brace ran down a bit lower on the back to give some support to the back it would be gr8. Felt uncomfortable as the straps run under the armpits
3,The Velcro straps did not slipped off underneath the straps below and dug in to both armpits.
3,The product was exactly what I expected to be. Not dissapointed at all. Stick with it and you will see results!!!
3,Was a little too small for me but would work if you were shorter
3,"I've been using this for about a week for various amounts of time each day.  It does seem to help correct your posture but the straps that go under your arms make it uncomfortable to wear for me.  I was hoping to be able to wear this under a top, unnoticed, but the wide straps make that impossible.  I will still try to use it since my posture is in need of help, I'm just disappointed that this isn't ""comfy"" like the name."
3,Under Brest uncomfortable need to be more supports
3,Can wear about an hour before it gets to me..
3,It doesn't give the support I needed.I ended up giving it to someone else & they have since passed it on for the same reason.
3,Itches my back but works
3,item was kind of small. Somewhat hard to get on by myself
3,So so.
3,"I am a bigger man. Some muscle and broad shoulders. After expanding it as far as it will go it still digs in at the armpits, even if I move my scapula close together. I can see it working for more petite people, but if your shoulders are wide it is going to be rough."
3,I just received the product and it seems to work fine.  My complaint is that the it sits to high up on your neck so if wearing a t shirt it's very visible.  I want to wear under my clothes so it's not viable to others.  I'm sending this back and ordering anther style.
3,Not that soft. I ordered a softer one after.
3,"I’m 58 years old and have been playing volleyball sines the age of 12. Indoor and outdoor (beach) this ball is very slippery, and quality very low. It feels like plastic cover. It’s not soft at all, but vey plastic feeling in my fingers. Don’t buy, look for a better quality. I believe it will be cracking after been used for while. Still really bad."
3,Not that soft enough for beginners
3,It did not hold up to outdoor use
3,First one I received had a hole in it.
3,"While the volleyball is exactly as pictured, it is not soft at all."
3,Not soft at all
3,"The name ""Softplay"" is incredibly misleading. This ball is harder than most. It's a shame, because the color was really beautiful. At least they accepted my return and refunded me promptly."
3,Not as soft as described. Leaves marks on arms.
3,The ball popped the first week.
3,Deflated way to fast
3,The ball came very flat
3,It had a scratch on it
3,👍🏼
3,Advertised as soft but just the opposite
3,"Peeling after a few uses.  If you can find a ball in the same price-range (and you can), get that instead."
3,"Its a volleyball, found the exact ball in walmart cheaper"
3,It's called soft play but it is actually hard on the hands
3,Not particularly soft compared to other volleyballs.
3,Not that soft! It really stings our forearms!
3,not really round
3,it is not elasticity
3,I ordered 12 of these volleyballs and 2 of them are always going flat.  I have to pump them up every other day to be able to use them in practice.
3,"I got the ball with in two business days. It was what I ordered, the only thing was it was advertised to glow in the dark and it doesn't. I wouldn't have paid so much for it if I had known ahead of time it doesn't glow in the dark."
3,"I bought it for the price but is has a ""cheap"" feel to it.  I just needed to have a volleyball in the camper so this will do the job."
3,Light weighedNot my favourite
3,Socks shredded after one wash
3,"I ordered size 8-9, however, the heel of the socks are actually very visible. When they arrived, the band they were wrapped in was marked L.  Anyone who orders these needs to think small."
3,"I followed the size guide, but these socks are way to small."
3,too hot for Miami!
3,Thin
3,Size 8-12 is too tight for 12 size feet. I bought the larger size and will see how they work.
3,Size and quality was not as much as I expected
3,"Bought for husband but it was so tight and small, I kept them since I had smaller feet. Also the back part of the sock slides down."
3,Ok nothing special
3,"Would have given more stars but, it arrived 2 days late. Two days past the delivery day that I was told to expect it."
3,Shorter lifespan than other socks I've purchased. But initially they are comfy.
3,Too short in the back
3,They are socks.
3,Pretty disappointed - socks tend to roll off the back of my heel. They're also on the thicker end of running socks.
3,"The socks are made of quality material and are very soft, however they are too small for my feet (size 12) and I bought size 13-15."
3,Website says sizes are 8 to 12. They are actually 9 - 12.
3,They are too thin.
3,"Because of the writing on the sock, it appears you have two right feet."
3,"very short, not suitable for washer."
3,"Reviewing these based on what I received. Did not get what what in the product picture nor do I feel these are ""black fashion"""
3,Very thin
3,they shrink so much after 1st washing
3,The description said size 8-12 but when it arrived it was size 9.5-11.5. Too big.
3,I have a pair of  Saucony socks my father gave me. What a difference from my regular socks! These must be a different type. I would say they are in between the two.
3,I thought I was getting 12 pairs for $25. I got 6 pairs. I got 12 individual socks. Who labels sock counts individually?  12 pairs for $25 is reasonable. 12 socks for $25 is a rip off.
3,Material is very thin.
3,these run small.  I am a mens 10.5 and these are slipping off of my heel.
3,"I found them to slide down the heel when walking, they are not really stitched in a way to keep form."
3,"kinda thin, kinda slick, not for distance running"
3,They are on the small side.
3,"Decent socks, but they shrink a LOT.Get the next size up from your shoe size."
3,There were holes in these socks after only a few (heavy duty) wearing.
3,Sweaty...
3,"I wear size 11 and they are slightly small. I will wear them, but I wouldn't buy them again."
3,There was a thread pull in each sock. Makes me wonder if they are seconds.
3,Just got them.  Sock size is standard large 10-13.  I took the 9.5-11.5 reported sock size literally and tried to convert shoe size.  The 9.5-11.5 is men's shoe size.  I wear an 8-8.5 and they are a bit big.  Wearable like others that say 10-13 is 8-12.5.  Look at reviews.  Some on both ends of the spectrum complain about size.  So if you aren't 9-12 shoe size you will probably mind a bit thinking the sizing is off the mark one way or another.
3,A bit small below just below the ankle for my size 10 men's foot.
3,Not perfect due to the sewn toe.  If that doesn't bother you then they wear well.
3,Too small and they haven't been washed.  I'm a size 9 men's sneaker.
3,I would rate them as ok.. A little on the thin side.
3,a little big
3,see above
3,Doesn’t count steps accurately
3,"For this price, I expected faster UI, more accurate pulse measuring. It costs a lot but gives you the same what you can get from cheaper device."
3,The Fitbit charge 2 lasted almost 3 years. My FB 3’s lasted about a year This Charge relentlessly asks to track my location no matter what I do in settings. It awards “zone minutes” that are not the amount of time spent exercising.  Accuracy has not improved from my experience but there is an onboard GPS for running.  I always get the protection plan in case it lasts more than a year and buy on sale because these are basically disposable.
3,"Unable to read while in the sun, it doesn’t always read sleep"
3,I only gave this fitbit 4  3 stars because even after charging battery to 100% you still can't see the screen. Not happy with this fitbit. The fitbit 2 was much better.
3,"I like this device overall.  It's simple, easy to use, and the whole FitBit ecosystem is great.  But I just can't get over the poor GPS connectivity.  Regularly, I get about halfway through a walk or run, and the GPS will randomly stop working and a message saying that the GPS signal couldn't be reached pops up and then GPS turns off for the remainder of the workout.  Also, apparently trying to start a GPS-enabled workout right after a previous one, will not allow GPS to work either.Sure, I understand that this happens sometimes.  But when it becomes a regular thing, it's enough of a pain-point that makes me want to get a different tracker.  Hopefully they can fix this with a firmware update or something in the future."
3,Like the product but hard to charge.
3,My third Fitbit. Can’t seem to get this one working correctly. Spent an hour with customer service. Still not working correctly
3,"Too big, especially for smaller wrists and not enough options or styles to change bands. Wrist placement is very finicky for accuracy"
3,Very dark sometime you can’t even see it I don’t keep track right
3,Does not work
3,Battery does not last long.
3,My band cracked after 6 months and I filed a claim. Still waiting for a month to receive it.
3,This is my second Fitbit I like the app and the sleep tracker but the charge battery is a shame... now I can’t charge anymore and I can’t use it. Fitbit need to find another way for charge the battery because the actual that is like a Clío didn’t stay in place and not charge the battery. I am thinking to change model.
3,Harder to use than older versions
3,Doesn't count most residential flights of stairs.  Need to fix the cut-off on the altimeter
3,Sleep tracking is up and down
3,"We used to have fitbits ages ago, and wanted a simple way to track our activity again."
3,this watch was not compatible with my Kindle.  I returned it!
3,Battery does not last as long as my charge 3
3,"I used my Fitbit to track my walking and biking.  But, The straps will not attach anymore."
3,My second Fitbit. This one crapped out within two months.
3,Yoga
3,Quality reminds me of something I could get a walmart or dollar general. It's ok.
3,A bit harder than expected.
3,Moves too much and leaves indents after use
3,Did not include the advertised carrying strap
3,Used to workout
3,Not made for use with shoes
4,"I'm not sure that this cream will make my nails stronger but time will tell.  I will say this, I really like the scent and it definitely conditions my cuticles wonderfully!"
4,I like the way it moisturizes both cuticles and nails. My nails are healthier and the scent is amazing!
4,"I’ve been using this product for about three weeks now and see an improvement in the strength of my nails. Previously, my nails were so fragile that I could bend them backward but they feel strong now. I’m applying the cream to my fingernails and cuticles about four times per day even though the container says two. Definitely recommend."
4,"This smells and feels nice. It moisturizes very well. I don't think it's helped my nails get stronger though. I've been using it twice a day for 2 weeks. Overall, I would purchase again but this jar will last a long time. You don't need to use a lot."
4,Has helped strengthen my nails significantly.
4,This product is great I am seeing results and I’ve been only using it for a few days. You have to be consistent tho I apply it a few times a day to my cuticles.
4,"This cream is nice and emollient. I don't know if it's making a real difference in my nails. I probably don't use it consistently enough. The only thing I really don't care for is the scent. At first it's sort of coconutty, but then it turns to a kind of smell that reminds me of boxed cake mix. I know, weird description.  I probably would not buy this again.  Instead I would try the other nail cream that has the word hoof in the name (maybe Hoofer's Choice?), or just go back to a good cuticle oil followed by the SOS hand cream in the red and white tube at Lidl stores. That's really nice."
4,I’ve been using this product on bare nails for above 3 weeks.  My nails LOOK much more healthy and are lo longer peeling and splitting but they still seem weak.  I generally wear polish all the time but I thought I would give this product time to take hold.  Still waiting for it to strengthen the nails.  They still break but I haven’t given up yet.  I try to use it at least 3x daily.  Will update it progress continues.
4,Really helpful for spilt nails
4,"I’m astonished, but I think this product actually worked. My nails have been in terrible health for the last year and a half, which was a sudden change from my strong, healthy, easy to grow out nails. I started using this product, and within two weeks my nails stopped peeling and cracking…and within a month my nails had grown out long enough to file away all of the damaged portions. This really seems to be a miracle solution to poor nail growth. I don’t usually use any scented products, but I don’t mind the coconut smell of this product. Though, if the smell was any stronger, I wouldn’t like it."
4,"My nails were weak, peeling and slow growing. I started taking biotin, which helped, but wasn’t working as well as I’d like so I searched for something I could apply directly to my nails. Hard as Hoofs had good reviews so I ordered some. It smells yummy and no kidding, after using it 2-3 times daily, within a couple of days I could see a difference. Been using a few weeks now and my nails are much stronger. They have stopped peeling,  don’t bend and break easily anymore, plus they’re growing again. I highly recommend this product!"
4,"This is fine as a moisturizer. You can’t apply it before an actual strengthening coat, and if you apply it too soon after, it slows the drying. This does nothing that an average lotion won’t."
4,"I wanted to really like this product. It does moisturize your nails and I feel my nails are stronger and thicker. However, the artificial coconut smell is awful. I hate coconut to begin with, and this is such an artificial bad scent, it is beyond annoying. I've been using this product just about daily before I go to sleep. I don't think I would put it on in the office during the day- too greasy and the smell would be too noticeable. My nails are definitely stronger, but they still aren't growing long. Seems whenever they get beyond a certain point, I get a crack at the edge and have to trim them back. Overall, my nails are in much better shape then before I started using this product. I prefer CND RescueRxx, but CND is not as moisturizing. Using both products together seems to be the best option for me.  I will keep using Hard as Hoof, but keep looking for a similar product with a better scent."
4,Be nice if where in a pump. More convenient
4,"I'm 64 and have terrible nails, they split and are paper thin.  I've had gel nails for years. Since the Delta variant, I wasn't keen on going to the nail salon and decided to give this a try. After a week, my nails seem healthier. I've ordered a nail supplement vitamin and will see if I can finally have healthy, natural nails. I think this product has promise."
4,Not up to hype but feels good going on.
4,I have been using it faithfully and my nails are still peeling. But I will keep trying.
4,It seems to be working so far i believe I've tried it for 2 weeks now. And cuticles and nails seem stronger and less peeling by my cuticles as well.
4,"I haven’t used it long enough to tell whether it helps grow my nails stronger, but the scent is wonderful and it feels very nice on my fingertips."
4,"I don't if this products works or not. I have only been using it three days. It does soften my dry, cracked cuticles. Looking forward to see if it actually improves my nail quality. It does not really smell like coconut; smells chemical."
4,"The product arrived on time.  I have applied it daily for a week now, but too early to determine effectiveness on my brittle nails playing the guitar, which is why I bought it."
4,Smells amazing. Thick and creamy without being greasy.
4,I like the coconut oil so good fragrance and I like that it is helping.
4,Smells great! I have ridges on my nails and it seems to smooth them out. My nails just feel better and are a little stronger.
4,"Finally got to try this product and I'm not disappointed. For anyone who thinks this may be a miracle product, it's not. However it does work to moisturize and strengthen your nails and cuticles. When I was using it everyday (bare nails) my nails grew to the longest they have ever been (not that long personally because i have stubs lol.) When I stopped using it my nails started going back to being thin and flimsy. So. If you want to keep the nice healthy strong look, you'll have to use it forever! As I personally don't use it now, I still like the product a lot. It can help to strengthen your nail after you get acrylics or anything else damaging to your nails. 9/10 recommended 😁"
4,On day three of using my product and so far so good.
4,"It's a little too early to tell if this product will help my nails, which peel and then split perpendicular to my finger tip, but they do seem to be healthy.  It is definitely moisturizing and smells great.  The one drawback is that you are supposed to apply it three times a day.  I try to do this when I know I will not have to wash my hands for a while, or touch anything that could be affected by the lotion, such as a book.  This is because, although it can be rubbed into the cuticles, it doesn't absorb as easily into the nails, so they are a little greasy for a while after applying.  The instructions say you can use with nail polish as well."
4,Strengthen my nails
4,Keep in mind that I did not use it 3x a day like the directions say. I did not see as much moisturizing or nails getting harder. It smells great. Probably won’t buy again.
4,"I've used this for about 3 weeks, 3-4 times a day.  There is no change in my nails, but my cuticles and the general skin around my nails are soft and look good."
4,A little greasy but so far so good.
4,This product has improved the condition of my nails when used 3 times a day. I don’t think it has made them much stronger though. I will probably purchase again.
4,Love how easy it is to use. Over polished nails as well
4,I'm undecided on this cuticle/nail cream. It is not a bad product by any means. Some of my friends swear by it! It smells really good...very coconutty! Just don't know if it has helped my nails as much as I'd hoped. I'm sure it works...for some more than others. Worth a try!
4,"My nails were a total mess.  I didn't know what to do so I decided to try Hard as Hoof.  The most important thing this product did for me was it healed my nails. Consequently, my nails were able to grow.  They don't grow long because I don't have hard nails but I bought a second jar because the healing was so impressive.  I recommend this product."
4,Smells great. Seems to have helped my nails.
4,Just finishing up my first jar . Improves nail strength and appearance . Not yet correcting a vertical split . Still hoping .
4,"At first, I honestly thought it was a waste of my time and money. Buuutttttt, fast forward a couple weeks later, I noticed how long my nails are! They are strong and beautiful. I can really save so much money from nail salons. I always get long acrylics and they always damage my nails. But thanks to this product, I am able to keep my nails long and strong! Get it and try it for yourself!"
4,"It’s moisturizing and I liked how it absorbed quickly! However, I felt like it didn’t do anything for my nails. It felt like a cuticle cream and I didn’t notice any difference in the condition of my nails. It is a VERY good cuticle cream though so it’s not a waste of money! I was initially skeptical getting a cream for my nails thinking what is a cream going to do for my nails, wouldn’t a cream be too thick to help my nails out? I was looking for a cheaper alternative to Nailtiques formula 2plus and I know that the two products are very different. Nailtiques comes in a nail polish bottle and you put it on like nail polish. I guess I was hoping that this product could do the same thing, but in a cream form and cheaper. It’s a great cuticle cream though! I was just looking for something that could help repair damaged nails. Again, love it as a cuticle cream! The texture is sooooo luxurious and it smells lovely!"
4,I'm a guy and I don't quite yet see much difference. Some improvement. I'm learning to play classical guitar and need my nails to play correctly. One of my nails may just have a flaw in the way it grows and continues to split in the same area each time it gets any length. My wife has me now taking biotin along with the cream and it might be a few months before I see any further improvement. I think this cream makes sense if your nails are dry and brittle but this is really going to be a case by case basis to say whether it will help or not.
4,"I have not had the product long enough to say anything definitive about if my nails are stronger. Mine tend to peel in layers, and a break tends to damage the nail well beyond the actual break. I can say, when I got the jar, I trimmed my nails back and after less than a week the nail is now grown beyond the tip of my finger. And I love being able to open the jar, barely touch the tip of my nails to the cream and rub it in. Super easy and quick, and somehow more reassuring than a product that just gets brushed on."
4,Good stuff
4,Great stuff worked right away for all my hang nails & cuticles.
4,"Package received much earlier than expected. The outer pkg was partially opened, but the product box was still properly sealed. Product recently came, so I've only tried the product twice. The cream is thick and seems to moisturize well. I love the ""coconut cream"" scent. As for effectiveness... it is still way too soon to judge."
4,My cuticles healed in less than a week.My nails are thin and peel. They are stronger and growing. I'm so pleased!!
4,Very nice.
4,Seems to help after 2 weeks but need more time.
4,Love this stuff!!! I had really strengthened my nails!
4,It does strengthen my nails. I have brittle nails due to thyroid issues. After a few days I noticed a difference. The only issue I have is the smell of coconut is very strong and lingers. I wish it came unscented or a lighter fragrance. Over all I may purchase again but the scent might be a deal breaker for me. If the scent doesn’t bother you YES it does work
4,"I really like the scent it smells like coconut. It does a good job at making your nails grow quickly. BUT, It doesn’t make your nails strong. My nails grew quickly in just a week but they are weak. I had to put a nail protector polish on them. If I didn’t they would break. It cream didn’t provide any strength to my nails. I put it on twice a day morning and night. But, I wash my hands a lot also. I’ve used other nail growth creams and it didn’t matter that I washed my hands a lot. I’m a nurse so I’m constantly washing my hands and using hand sanitizer. I will used this jar up but I won’t buy it again. I just prefer to take biotin it helps my hair and nails grow. Now when I started taking the biotin with the nail cream my nails became stronger and grew faster. But, that’s a combination of both and not just the cream. So, that being said I would waste my money on the cream. It does moisturize your nails and soften your cuticles but that’s not what it’s made for specifically. Save your money and buy some biotin vitamins or hair and nail vitamins and call it a day. Or try it and see if it works better for you??? But, I’d advise you not to wash your hands a lot after you apply it. So just applying it before bedtime would work but it may take longer to work and like I said it doesn’t strengthen your nails at first when they are growing. You have to be careful not to break them before they get long enough to begin to strengthen. Mine always broke before they got to the strengthening part."
4,Not as watery as other products I use. Smells good too!
4,"That being said, I did notice a difference inn my nails over the course of using this for a few weeks. They still are brittle and peel, but not as bad. The picture they have posted is either after months of continuous use, or I've just horrible nail beds. But so far I've liked this stuff, I'll keep using it. Smells nice, although it does burn a tad when you've a ripped cuticle!"
4,Came way faster than I expected. Smells of playdoh which isn't horrible but all I can smell when I wear it.
4,"I like this nail care.  It helps to strengthen my flaking, split nails.  It smells like coconut.  It seems to moisturize adequately."
4,I so far like the product in time I will tell if it works or not.
4,I like the way that Hard as Hoofs hardens my nails compared to other products.  I apply it daily to my bare nails.
4,Makes my nails long and very healthy
4,Just received I read all the good reviews so I hope it does what it supposed to do.I only have a 4 star since I just started using this product.
4,Helps with eczema but didn’t do squat for my nails!Four stars for eczema only one star for nail care.
4,"I have been using this product for about 1 week. So far, my nails have been strong. The aroma of product is strong and smells like the suntan lotion that I use. It’s not a bad smell. The smell makes you feel like you’re on vacation! Product is working, so far."
4,"Makes nails stronger, would buy again"
4,"I have not used it as often as they tell you to, but even just once a day about five times a week, I have noticed a great improvement in my nail strength."
4,The smell is so good! The moisture it gives is noticeable and lasts for a while.
4,"Makes ur hands and Fingers feel like butter. Great scent, no greasy feeling!"
4,Seams to be helping after having acrylics...My nails are growing out faster..
4,I’ve had it about a week and it does seem to be improving my nails.
4,It works great if you can remember to use it often enough.  I would like a more long-term solution.
4,"This stuff is easy to use and non-greasy.  It only takes a little bit at a time for your nails so it's lasting me a long time.  The one thing I don't like about it, is that I think it's drying out my skin a little bit.  I just put good moisturizer on after I put this on and it's totally fine."
4,Seems to be working. The smell and texture are good too.
4,Smell nice and very moist.
4,This really works well...just be careful to only put it on your nail. I massaged it into my cuticles as well which led to hard cracked cuticles.
4,I'm on my second tub. It's amazing. My nail are very strong now and grow like crazy. I just use the before going to bed. It's amazing!
4,My nails were a mess from wearing acrylic and glue in nails for a long time.  My daughter suggested this cream for my nails after she had used it for similar reasons.  We have both seen our nails improve and strengthen from using this product.
4,I really think that this is helping my nails get thicker.  I've been using about 3 weeks and do feel like my nails are getting stronger!!!
4,It helps my nails  to grow.  I use it all the time.
4,"After a wedding in mid October 2020 I had troubles growing back strong nails. Decided to give this stuff a try and it definitely works! After 4 months of brittle nails I was able to grow beautiful, strong nails in just 3 weeks! Smells great, just like coconut and very moisturizing.  BUT  be aware this stuff is for nails and cuticles and it only takes a small finger full any more then that and it makes your hands feel a little greasy. Definitely be getting more, highly recommended!"
4,This is a nice moisturizing nail hardening product.  Seemed to help with dry cuticles and hardening of my nails.
4,"I liked what other users had to say about this product and was hoping it would help my dry, brittle nails.  The first jar proved to be amazing.  Nails grew and were strong enough that I cancelled acrylic nail appointment and kept my own nails.  This second jar though does not seem to being as good a job as the first.  But, it is winter here where I am and therefore house is dryer so am thinking this is what is contributing to my nail problem.  They are the pits right now but will continue using and hopefully they will get better."
4,Not a bad smell. I haven't noticed if it makes my nails grow as I get them professionally done. But it has kept my cuticles soft and I haven't gotten those pesky little pieces of dry hanging skin.
4,the smell is super nice. it has a shea butter aroma to it that’s really nice. my hands feel super soft after using it. i had acrylics on my nails for years and therefore my nails were very thin and broke easily. after using this my nails are getting white again and a lot thicker and longer. definitely worth trying!
4,It does seem to be helping my nails.
4,"Ave not had ‘tis productlong, but seems to really be helping my nails.Iwouldbuy this product agai."
4,This product seems very luxurious. The packaging is very pretty. The cuticle cream is very rich in texture. My only complaint is that the smell is a little strong. Originally I thought I wouldn’t be able to use it because it smelled so strong it gave me a headache. Thankfully the strong vanilla scent fades after it absorbs into the cuticle. This product would be absolutely perfect if they made a non-scented option.
4,My nails have been very brittle after a recent surgery and I thought this might help. So far I think it has helped! My nails definitely haven’t been breaking as easy as they were before using this cream. Do they still break occasionally? Yes. But do they break as often? No. Overall I think it’s worth the money.
4,Great for cuticles.
4,I liked this hand cream.  I think it really helps.  I usually give my nails a break between Colorstreet applications and I use this on those nights.  I do think it's helped my nails.  My one complaint is that I wish there were less scent.  I'm pretty sensitive to scent and have a habit of sleeping with my hands near my face so this smell really bothers me.
4,"I just got this a couple of weeks ago, and use it faithfully.  I see my big toe seems to be healing nicely.  It had a split in it and I couldn't get it to go away.  Seems as if the toenail has fused together now.  Very happy!"
4,"If you use it as recommended it will work! The only issue I had was that it didn't come with instructions, I had to google it."
4,Good quality and received exactly what I expected
4,"This does help,with cuticles and the strength of my nails.  I’ll purchase again"
4,"Made a huge difference in nail health. I'm a fingerstyle guitar player and nail health is critical. This product and the glass nail files I bought with it virtually ended nail splitting. A slight drawback is the odor (coconut) , which isn't horrible but not a scent I would seek out. I get around it by using smaller amounts once a day after bathing, washing and a little more before bedtime, being sure to rub it in well to nails and cuticles."
4,"A little goes a long way with this one. Smells great! Last a while, & I think it does what it does. Tbh I haven’t been using it consistently to see any big changes in my nails but they are definitely moisturized after using."
4,I have not had any visible results after weeks of use and the jar is half empty but I will continue to use and see if a miracle happens.It has a very strong scent so be prepared.I don’t even see any true moisturizing  benefits.
4,Very very nice smell if you like coconut.
4,Smells great and works overnight
4,"I used this product on my dry cracked nails just a few times, and now my nails are much much better.  So five stars for this miracle nail cure.  The only reason I deducted a star is for the bad smell."
4,"well you rub it on nail several times, it does absolutely nothing."
4,I enjoyed how easy it is to use. It absorbs in the nail quickly. I have noticed an improvement in the look of my nails in just 2 weeks.
4,"I think it's working pretty well.  I was using another product but found out recently it had formaldehyde so I started using this since it had better ingredients.My nails were breaking at first &still seemed thin but a month into using my nails are slowly growing, especially my thumb & pinky.I hope this starts working on all my nails evenly."
4,"This works! I have used tons of different lotions,creams oils for dry cuticles/nails. I work in dry and dusty environment. My nails are slowly starting to grow and my cuticles not dry staying moisturized. Great product and I have recommended it to several people."
4,"The smell is strong but not bad. I noticed it works really well to grow nails, I saw results within a few weeks instead of months with pills BUT my nails still break so I'm indifferent if I will buy the product again."
4,I try to put this on my nails daily but sometimes forget. They seem to be getting stronger.
4,I noticed an immediate change in my nails and it’s a GREAT moisturizer for cuticles!
4,"In a few days, I could already see an improvement in my nails. Glad I bought it."
4,Very good for strengthening nails. Mine were so thin from getting them done at the salon this helped bring them back to life!
4,Seems to be working to strengthen soft nails.
4,I haven’t seen great results on my. right hand but I have on my left hand so I am still waiting for better results on my right hand. I know it works because of my left hand nails being stronger and growing.
4,I’ve been having problems with peeling nails. I’ve definitely seen improvement since I started using this.
4,Smells nice and feels good.  Haven't used it long enough to tell if it works yet
4,"I was amazed at how fast I noticed results. I have been having a problem with weak nails lately, possibly because of the alcohol hand sanitizers we need to use these days. When I applied this for a few days I saw an almost immediate difference."
4,Softens cuticles nicely.  Smells great
4,I don’t know if it’s working but I love the smell!
4,"i apply it once a while so i cant say if it actually works but really good for hands, thick and moisturizing"
4,I purchased this product after removing my dip nails when nail salons closed due to COVID-19. My nails were thin and breaking. I noticed that within a week my nails felt stronger and were growing instead of breaking off. I began using the product on my feet as well since I wasn’t able to get pedicures. I recently purchased my 3rd one. My feet don’t even feel like I’ve been lacking a pedicure. They’re so soft! This stuff smells amazing too!
4,"Though I wish this product were a bit thicker/richer, I do think it has strengthened my nails in just the short time I've been using it.  The smell is wonderful...distinctly coconut, but mild enough to be enjoyable."
4,"I bit my nails for about 22 years, but recently I have been trying to grow them out. My issue is that I have really thin nails and they tend to rip and break really easily. I bought this to try to and strengthen my nails but I'm still not convinced this works super well. The instructions say to rub this into your nails 2-3 times a day. This is a cream, so it is really moisturizing, but that means you do have oil on your nails as they are drying, even when you wipe off the excess. As someone who is on their laptop frequently, it is difficult to do things without getting it all over my computer when I put this on. I do think it made my nails harder though after continued use, but I'm not entirely sure if it actually did or it was just wishful thinking on my part."
4,"Not super moisturizing or greasy like some nail creams, and absorbs quickly when applied. But I did notice an improvement in my nails (which aren’t great) after even one or two uses. Seems to strengthen well."
4,"I had acrylics for many years. Since the pandemic started, I have not been able to go get acrylics again. My natural nails are thin and were very dry. Notice that I used the past tense. They were dry. They are no longer dry. This product is very moisturizing and it softens my cuticles. My nails continue to be thin but they're starting to look healthy.This product has a very pleasant fragrance. It smells a little bit like coconut and a little bit like play dough, in my opinion.I plan to buy again."
4,I got this about a month ago.  I’m using it twice a day and my nails are definitely stronger and tougher.  But I’m still experiencing some peeling at the tips. So I’ve cut them down a bit to go be them another chance.  I would recommend this product to a friend.
4,"I got this a few weeks ago and have used it daily since then. I am already good at keeping my cuticles moisturized, so I bought this to strengthen my nails, which are super thin and split easily.  I apply it at least twice a day, as recommended.  It'll take awhile to see any improvement, but my hopes are high.  I will post an addition to this review if I see any improvements to my nails.  Fingers crossed..."
4,I use this almost every day! It smells great and my nails feel firm. I keep it on my desk and use it throughout the day. Will absolutely repurchase
4,"I've had brittle nails for all of my 24 years of life. I'm a constant peeler from my anxiety and the only thing that's only helped is the OPI Nail Strengthener. I looked into this and decided for the price and from reviews, I would give it a try. Only been using it for about a week and I already noticed a difference! My ends are so much whiter than usual and the nail itself seems more sturdy. Very moisturizing on my cuticles as well. Smell is mild coconut with like a body lotion smell? It says use 3x a day or as needed and I use it about 5 times or whenever I'm just lounging around lol. Excited to keep using it!"
4,Seems to help my nails quite a bit!!! I would definitely recommend trying it if your nails are weak / brittle
4,"I like that you only needed a little to cover finger nails, did not drip all over the place and will probably moisturize nails and nail beds adequately.  I do like the Coconut smell, but it was too strong for me and reminded me of the wooden floor polish from years ago (after they polished my Elementary School wooden floors).  Something in the formula made my nose run and I had to stop using it. I am allergic to tree pollens, rag weed and golden rod, etc."
4,Rich and creamy. Easy to apply
4,"Really helped my dry cuticle problems and is strengthening my dry, brittle nails."
4,I love the light coco/Shea butter smells. Great with softening cuticles.
4,"I love the smell and my hands feel super  moisturized after applying, however I didn’t see any change to the thickening and growth aspect. This is just my experience maybe it works for others, I’d buy again just because the smell and feeling my hands have after using."
4,Good moisturizer...  especially for nails and cuticles
4,"This cream is easier to apply and soaks in better than cuticle oils.  While my nails look much healthier, there isn't much change in the cuticles.  Nails are stronger and growing faster.  Much prefer the cream over oils."
4,It’s only been 2 weeks but my nails do seem to be stronger. Before I couldn’t even go with out nail polish to strengthen them. But now they are ok without polish. As they grow I’m sure the nails will get even stronger
4,"While it moisturizes my nails and cuticles, it is not some miracle cream After using it daily for four months, my nails are not long and glamorous, even though I take excellent care of them, keep my cuticles taken care of, and use high quality polish and top coat. I have natural nails."
4,"I have weak, dry nails that peel easily.  I was using a nail strengthening 'polish' but it's a bit of a hassle to apply and remove consistently so I wanted to try this.  I have experienced some chipping again without the 'polish' barrier, but I'm hoping it improves with time, as this is a very moisturizing cream and I do see improvement in appearance.  I was a little off-put by the texture of the 'cream', because it's somewhere between a cream and a paste.  I suppose that's the beeswax.  I'm surprised by those who say they apply it, wait a few hours and then remove?  The only reason I can think to do so is to apply polish.  I find no need to do so - the surface of my nails does have a bit of a residue like with lotion but it soaks in like lotion; I just rub the excess off my finger tips."
4,My nails are getting stronger after using for 3 weeks.
4,This product produces great results after two weeks of regular use.
4,It seems to be OK but I’m still waiting to see the results
4,"Very moisturizing and works on my stubborn rough thick cuticles, as well as just dry skin. You do have to regularly use it and it’s not the best smelling, like some others, but it’s not bad either… I actually like that, because I’d rather it be whatever it’s supposed to be, instead of masking it with perfumes and things that are detouring from treating the problem. (That’s not what I bought it for!) My cuticles seem to be pretty happy!"
4,"Uh, did not make my nails hard as hooves. Smells fantastic. Is moisturizing. Don't believe it affected my nail growth or strength whatsoever."
4,"Just happened on this product!  One of the better products on the market.  Easy to use, no scent and not greasy.  Had sculpted nails for yrs.  This is great.  Nails are strong and growing."
4,"I have weak, flexible nails and could rarely grow them much past the end of my fingers.  I now have much longer nails.  They must be stronger because I don't tear or break them as easily.  Would buy again, but it doesn't take much per application and I think it will last a long time."
4,"I have used Tough as Hoof one month to strengthen my nails during the Covid19 quarantine.  I was unable to get my acrylic nails so i removed them and used the nail strengthening cream for one month.  I can definitely feel and see an improvement in my nails and cuticles.  I will be getting acrylic nails again soon, and intend to keep using Tough as Hoof.  On the opening Amazon page for Tough as Hoof, it says one bottle $7.94 or three bottle for $43.40.  This needs to be corrected."
4,"Using this with a strengthener so not sure if it works 100% but smells great, I love putting it on after washing my hands!"
4,To soften up my cuticles and strengthen my nails
4,"Awesome scent. Very moisturizing if a little oily... but great. Have notice a difference, not much but thats because I don't use it as often as instructed. Overall satisfied:]"
4,"This really seems to work.  But oh my, it STINKS!  I’ve been using it for about a week and a half, and my nails are noticeably stronger. I use it before bed and usually in the morning (long before I go to work) because it smells like coconuts and vanilla and it takes forever for the smell to go away! Seriously, I came home from work today and after multiple applications of hand sanitizer today, thought I’d better apply some. Here I am an hour later and as I type (hands 15+ inches away), I can smell this stuff like I put it in my nose. If you wear nice perfume, this will overpower it (unless, of course, you are a coconut/vanilla perfume kind of person). Bottom line, it has been working great, but I’m looking for something else because of the fragrance."
4,"Seems to be helping dry areas around nails, will order again."
4,I really like the moisturizing. Hope it works as my nails are in tough shape following removal of gel/acrylic nails.
4,I like this product. It is very moisturizing. It has a nice scent and and I can tell that my nails are in a better condition.
4,Great product. Nails are stronger
4,"Great product for nails that are weak and peeling. Since I started using this, my nails and cuticles look so much better!"
4,I use this to soften my cuticles. Still a work in progress!!
4,"I just got this last week so I'm not sure yet how well it works, but it swells amazing! Rubs in easily. Will update after longer use."
4,"Just received yesterday, so can't really review.  Sadly, it is very sweet-smellyingto me.  Others may like the smell."
4,I’ve been using this stuff for 10+ years and it works so well! However I really liked the original cherry almond scent and wish they would change it back.
4,"Good product!  .. does what it says. Scent a bit strong for me,"
4,Definitely works but it's fairly small(like a small jar of moisturizer). I use about a fingernail sized dallop and apply to each nail bed and then massage it into each cuticle a few times a day when I remember.- so it does last a lil while. You may want to purchase two and keep one at work and one at home or that kind of thing.
4,It must be good... my wife took it on me and did not give it back
4,"Have only used this for about a week or so, using it because My nails can be fragile when they starting growing. So using this to see if they can keep grown without breaking. Its very moisturizing and has a light coconut smell which I love. So far so good!"
4,"This is a miracle cream for my nails. They were constantly breaking or chipping in the dry, higher altitude environment we live in. Trying various nail polish, creams and this is my go-to! Not really moisturizing for your cuticles but I'm happy my nails are stronger and not chipping!"
4,I only bought this product based on the reviews but I am so glad I did.  The smell is amazing!  I've only been using a few days but it seems to be very moisturizing.  It's very thick and a small amount goes a very long way.
4,"Well... after a month of use,  I haven’t really noticed a difference in my nails, but it sure softens my hands and it smells delicious!"
4,My nails were destroyed from just 2 powder dip manicures. I have used this daily for a week and already see improvement in my nails. They were peeling like onions. This product saved my nails. And shaped up my cuticles. Very moisturizing
4,"I'm 80 and had a nail that split as soon as the free edge got any length at all.  Nothing helped.  Tried this for two weeks and the free edge is 1/8"" wide and no split!  Maybe now I can let the nail grow longer and do a project without catching the split nail on something."
4,"This is really great as long as you use it for the recommended 3 times per day, if you use it sporadically it won’t work as well."
4,Love this line of nail products.  Goes on well and dries down smooth. Good value for the price.
4,Got the job done. Not bad at all .
4,Pretty good stuff. I use this instead of acrylic.
4,"The base coat never set properly unfortunately, but the top coat was great for a first time user. Great for the price and very easy to use!"
4,"I bought this because of a YouTube video. It is very simple and saves me a lot of money but did not last long at all by itself, but when I use a dab of nail glue with it, it lasts me about two week. Would definitely purchase again :)"
4,Let’s just say I’ve been testing this product for a month on different family members as I just started doing my nails. The base coat is AMAZING. Super strong and adheres to the gel polish. However the top coat is not my favorite it’s very nice but it doesn’t harden your nail like most top coats do and my nails feel very weak with this top coat. Also chips after couple of days 3+ days.
4,Was for a friend but no complaints.
4,Really like this duo! It helps my gel manicure last about a couple weeks. Ive had some rare instances where my gel seems to chip and it might be the top coat. Other than that pretty surprised at how good these are for the price!
4,"It’s thick, but works good once you get used to it!"
4,"So having such thin flimsy nails i always have a hard time keeping my gel nails on. If I get them professionally done it'll start peeling at week 3. If I do them at home I basically end up peeling the off the whole thing by day 5. Chipping at day 2. Dsonesnt help i work with my hands a lot! This though! It feels so much stronger compared to other brands of top coats! I definitely recommend start by putting it on the tips first and then working the rest of the nail. Also for the whole ""don't get it on your skin"" thing it just gets a little hot under the light. Definitely place nails under 120sec each coat. Hope y'all find this helpful!"
4,This is great for applying fake nails on just put under a uv light and your good to go❗️❗️
4,Love this
4,Great for beginners. Wish the bottle was bigger
4,Recommended! New fav no wipe gel base/top coat polish
4,It’s okay does the job. Definitely good for beginners.
4,Bought for a friend and she said it's the best she's used this far. I'll stick to the Beetles brand but it's good to know there's an alternative that works well if necessary.
4,"The base coat and top coat worked really well. However, on my uv machine, it takes about 4 or 5 times through to cure the base coat. I have tried to do a thinner coat, but it still takes a lot of repetitions before it stops being so tacky. This is not a problem for me as I am doing home manicures and not servicing clients."
4,This product works great on my nails! My only complaint is that the material coated on the outside of the bottle (the pink veneer/material) is starting to warp a bit at the top threads.
4,"I think this is the best top and base coat I've found on amazon. My only complaint is that the gel peels easily but if you're the type to not touch or mess with your nails at all, then this product would be great for you."
4,"So I used this product with the same brand black gel color. Im not sure if it's a weird batch I got or the way the colors showed through but... the top coat gave my black polish this weird navy blue hue when they are in the light. It's hard to notice for everyone else but I can tell. It's fine with every other color. The wear and last of it is good though, so I don't mind the slight issue in the color"
4,it’s alright
4,I am glad I bought these but the top coat has been leaking a bit out of the top so it won’t last as long as I’d like but I still am pretty glad I bought it! And the price isn’t bad either!
4,"Good quality, very shiny but to little of product"
4,"I did only once with these nails base and top. I can say it is not bad, last about one week."
4,I don't have to go to the nail salon anymore. These are great !!
4,Great product. Just wish they came in bigger sizes.
4,"I love this base & top coat. I bought my own lamp and gel polishes right before the pandemic cause I knew I wouldn’t be able to get my nails done anymore, I originally bought a different brand for my top & base coat and I kept getting this horrible bubbles in my nail polish, it only ever happened after I put my top coat on and it was quite frustrating. I tried doing extremely thin layers and googled/you tubed other ways to prevent getting the bubbles and nothing worked. I have this brand for a matte top coat and never had an issue so I decided to try the base & top coat. I didn’t experience any bubbles! No issues at all!!  I even noticed that my colors seemed more vibrant and I get more compliments then before. I’m definitely sticking to this brand."
4,ok so this top and base coat would be perfect for most people but my daughter has purple hair and she has a shampoo that boosts her purple hair. she put on a whitish pinkish polish (which is way more white on the nail then the color of polish in the picture) with the top and base coat. she went in the shower and comes out and her nails are purple!!! so if u have died hair beware that this polish does latch on to dye!! hope i could help!
4,Really smooth and shiny but it has a really strong smell
4,"So far it's a great product,  I will buy it again! Delivery was faster then expected."
4,Very easy to use and great with dip powder as you have time to clean cuticle line and sides. There really isn't much of a smell to them. The top coat is shinny which I like. The only down fall is the bottles are smaller.
4,Came in fast they are pretty small but  good
4,Top coat is amazing and base coat doesn’t really work
4,"It’s a little thicker than I’d like, but otherwise I love it! Lasts for a long time and works great!"
4,"I resorted to doing my gel nails at home since everything is shut down due to COVID.  This is the first time purchasing any base/top coat so I do not have anything to compare it to.  Overall, it works well.  It is quite thick, but dries OK. I was nervous about the top coat not working after it cured, because I am so used to having nails wiped with alcohol at the salon.  BUT - it did the job.  No problems.  I would purchase again."
4,Not bad for the price
4,Great! With this quarantine life and trying to get my nails to grow (only way I can do that is by getting them done with gel i had to get my own stuff) this product makes them last!! Longer than what my nail lady would use!!! 4 stars because they are a little small.
4,"This was great for the price. Only issue was it did chip in some nails but that may have been true to operator error, I may not have cured the polish long enough. All in all I’m happy with my purchase. Also, arrived a lot sooner than I had anticipated."
4,These two products work fairly well.
4,"I got these because I decided to start doing my own dip nails at home but wanted to have some shellac colors to put on top as well. I really like this product, but it can be clumpy at times/leave your nails uneven if you aren't being careful with how you're applying it/how much you're putting on. Make sure to close the caps tight after using, one of mine wasn't and the brush got super weird and now I can't use it.Great for doing your nails at home. Super easy to use. Very easy to remove. It doesn't always last very long (definitely hasn't lasted me up to two weeks) but it's so convenient to maintain that it doesn't really bother me."
4,Used one time. Worked pretty well for someone who had to resort to diy nails because of Corona virus! 👍
4,Love this product. Both bade and top coat.Top coat dries so good.
4,"This is the first set of gel polishes I've bought. I did so in order to use some holographic powder (Holo crack) that my guy gave me as a gift. I set it with UV flashlight originally bought to find scorpions. So don't think you have to buy one of those fancy UV lamps specifically for nails. Any UV lamp will do. I just let it shine for about a minute and a half and it's all good. The gel taco sets it with good shine and hardness. They last me about 2 weeks, and I have a tendency to be rough with my hands. Overall pretty good to me."
4,"The top coat is amazing! I love it. The base coat is weird (minus a star).  You have to put a super EVEN coat on the whole nail and it can’t be too thin of a layer because it becomes uneven. You have to use just the right amount. Anyway, it makes me wonder if the base coat is even necessary. Also, the base coat doesn’t dry hard after the lamp. It’s a bit sticky so don’t touch it. That’s supposedly normal though."
4,"I usually always order Gelish but my friend told me to try this for a fraction of the price. I'm glad I switched and I'll continue to use this. I was skeptical of the ""no wipe"" so I first tried one hand wipe and one hand not. Washed and dried hands. Both hands lasted equally as long. I will continue to wipe just for my peace of mind. Works just as well as Gelish, smaller bottle. Amazing price. Typically lasts about 2 weeks if I don't pick."
4,"A gift for the wife. She hesitated to try it, but after some pushing finally gave in. The end result was it is something she will try again. That's important because she doesn't like new gadgets and doesn't seem to be concerned about saving money on a salon trip. So, just getting her to attempt to try it on her own was a bit of a challenge. She admitted it wasn't too difficult to do herself and the results were very good. The polish dried hard and smooth, just as good as the salon. AND it didn't take a lot of time to do."
4,Love that it is no wipe. Does provide a decent shine. Doesn’t last as long as the salon but still way more convenient than going to the salon
4,Top coat does not wear well. Base coat works great!
4,EFFICIENT AND EASY TO USE
4,I love this product it’s very easy and it last for 14 days
4,Great product awesome shine
4,Excited to try
4,Good product. Does not leave sticky residue
4,Love it stays for 4weeks really good the price is great I would  recommend it
4,"make sure you are sober when you put it on the first. it's more difficult than regular polish, but it is 100% worth it,  very great colors and it last a lot longer."
4,"Good product, fast delivery"
4,I really like this base/ top coat but it does leave almost a blue tint to the polish sometimes or it can be streaky.
4,"Base coat is amazing, top coat has some bubble problems. However, better than any top coat I’ve found under 10"
4,Easy to apply with brush. Doesn’t smell as strong as other brands.
4,"A thin coat goes a long way, filing the nail bed before use is beneficial for best results, if not it will peel faster. Also, if you use one thick coat wipe the edges because once it dries it looks very thick and very difficult to fix."
4,This top coat didn’t work for my chrome powders. Melody Susie top coat works so much better. This brand does work just not for powders
4,It’s a great  deal for the price. Last just as long as OPI and other gel brands the salons use.
4,Pretty nice polish.
4,Lovely shine!!
4,"Great shine, wish it was a thicker consistency but all in all great quality nonetheless."
4,It works great I have no complaints
4,Really easy to use I love it
4,This product is one of the better once you can get for the price and great for beginners. It is definitely my go base and top coat right now.
4,Love it
4,Liked this product and the cost is fair. I have used name brands that have cost more and this brand is equivalent.
4,I love the topcoat. I stopped using the base coat because I thought it was so hard to remove. But I have been using the topcoat over both regular nail polish and gel polish and both turn out great!
4,Loving using this with my other polishes as fast as ease of removal I do use peel off base under the gel base.
4,I used this base and top coat with the Gellen polish brand. This stuff works great- top coat is very glossy and dries fast with the UV lamp. Like instantly dry. I’ve had these nails for 2 weeks and the gloss wore off a smidge but that’s expected after 2 weeks. Still hasn’t chipped or lost ALL glossiness. I recommended this brand to 2 friends. Overall great purchase! I will be buying the colors next.
4,"I spent hours reading reviews and decided to go with this base & top coat. I wanted to use a gel base and top coat for dipping powder. I love the glass shine and they are more durable than just using a dip powder system. I also enjoy that I DO NOT have to buff between coats of dipping powder.HOWEVER - there is clearly a quality control issue with packing. My first order arrived with 2 BASE coats and no top coat. I was able to return and get a new one through Amazon easily. I referred another friend who uses dipping gel to the product since I was so happy with it. However, today her order also arrived with 2 BASE coats and no top coat. This is frustrating as you have to wait again for a replacement product. Also - it clearly isn't just me."
4,Thanks it’s great
4,"The base coat and top coat apply easily and cured well under my UV/LED lamp. It's true, you don't need to wipe the top coat. However, the top cost isn't as shiny as I would like and it has a blueish undertone in it. For my first time doing my own gel nails, I think they look good. I just want an ultra-thin top cost to give it that professional appearance."
4,"My favorite no-wipe top coat so far! Super glossy, shiny finish. Easy to apply. My only gripe is that it started to leak after a few months or started to build up around the cap/top of the bottle. The base coat is great, too."
4,These are great however beware of certain gel colors. In natural nail both are great in some colors both are great shiny long lasting. On other colors that dont cure as well this is not protective enough. I would recommend but know the gel color can alter results
4,Love the way this works just wish the base would dry like the top coat instead it’s sticky but I still like it
4,"This does what it says it will do and the top coat is not sticky at all when it sets. The only complaint I have is that if you try to close the bottle when there is polish on the brush and the polish gets onto the mouth of the bottle, the cap will actually shrink wrap onto the mouth of the bottle making it very hard to open! This has happened to me several times so now I make sure there is no polish on the outside of the mouth of the bottle and I try to close it very gently not tightly. Please be aware of how you close this nail polish otherwise it will take FOREVER TO OPEN when you want to use it again."
4,This set is really nice and works well for acrylic nails. Be warned that on natural nails the top coat burns when cured. Otherwise this product is awesome.
4,"It gave me no issues at all and a very great product. I only wish it was more in the bottle, I’ve never almost run out of top coat and this one is going quick."
4,Top coat is amazing but base coat is not very good as an adhesive/won’t cure well
4,"This polish works as described, and lasts 2 weeks. Be sure to use it in a ventilated room, the smell is strong."
4,I have had some issues with top coat ontop of regular nail. But i think it may be because my nails my not be 100% dry cuz im impatient when it comes to nail polish dtying lmao😁😂
4,Excellent base & top coat. Makes my nails really shiny and hard and my polish last for 2+ weeks. But it does seem to dent if you push your nail or something sharp into it and for that I’m removing one start. Removal is easy too with a 180 grit file.
4,Works great.
4,Worked pretty good
4,"PROS:Goes on as well as any other brand of base and/or top coat I've tried (Gelish, Fingerpaints, ASP). It's thick, but I feel like that's to be expected.Excellent shine.Doesn't peel up at the cuticle as soon as other brands.Amazing price.CONS:Maybe it's just me, but once I was ready to remove my gel polish, I just peeled it all off in one piece. It was the best (not for the health of my nails, obviously) because it was so easy and I didn't have to soak in acetone or whatever. With this brand, it requires either a soak or peeling it off tiny chunk by tiny chunk."
4,The base coat is just ok but the top coat is pretty good. Impossible to get off without peeling it though. Tried acetone too and nope.
4,Great base and top coat. Just have to make sure you cure it right with your UV/LED light. Just wished it lasted longer.
4,Good product.
4,I like the top coat it’s nice and shiny. The base coat is a bit thicker than I would have liked. After your done with your gel manicure it can look a bit thick due to all the layering.. and I prefer a thinner gel manicure but for the price.. I mean you can’t go wrong.
4,"Overall this is a good set. It can be thick so be sure to wipe the brush on the side of the bottle before applying and when covering your nail. Make sure to use thinner coats and apply evenly or else you’ll see the lines/uneven levels after curing.For curing times, I have a UV LED lamp and wasn’t sure how long to cure for. Top coat 60 seconds is perfect. Cures hard and comes off easily when time to remove. For base coat I tried 60 seconds but was having a hard time when removing it, so I went down to 30 seconds and that seems to have helped."
4,Although I am no professional and just started doing gel nails at home I am pleased with this product and would buy again.
4,Be sure to order the right light with this product
4,Easy to apply
4,"SO, ive been in the at home gel nails game for like 5 years.that being said ive TRIED THEM ALL, and  this is the one top and base coat set i keep coming back for. I have purchased this twice already, and will continue to replace.my only down side to this is that it does cause SOME polishes to do the streaky line thing true gellers know what i mean.ive noticed it only with the brand, CHINA GLAZE gel polishes.Every body always compliments my nails, sometimes i just do a ""refresh"" of base and topcoat halfway through my manicure and someone always notices!buy it!"
4,works just like described. Had no issues when using these products. The top coat doesn't need to be wiped off. Once you cure it it's good to go. You do have to wipe off the base coat tacky layer though.  I will be buying again.
4,Very shiny but took long to cure. I think it's because my lamp is a low watt lamp. You might need a high watt lamp to cure. It's very pretty though leaves nails shiny.
4,I used this for the first time the other day. It works great my nails had the professional look and feel.Wish the bottles were a little bigger
4,"the product works great, the only reason i didn’t give five stars was because it smells TERRIBLE. like a skunk almost and it’s very strong. but it works, and works well."
4,Nice product. Gives good base and top coat coverage. Top coat is nice and shiny
4,Pretty good product. Holds up very good for being non-professional.
4,Just wonderful. Stay 3 weeks+ with nice shine.
4,Pretty good stuff.
4,Top coat is very good and i like it. But the base coat takes forever to come off when you soak. You need tocsoak twice to get it off. If you buy this be wary. I had to file off the base coat. So now I just use the top coat. The base coat is not worth the time to take it off.
4,Good polish just starting out with gel polish
4,"Good base and top coat on natural nails.Base coat is thin, which I like, and cures in about 30 seconds under a mid to higher powered led light.  The base coat is tacky when it cures, but doesn't move.  It seemed a little more sticky than most base coats, which worried me for a second, but after two coats of polish (same brand) and top coat it was gel hard and totally cured.Top coat goes on thick, which makes it a little hard to get a nice thin layer, but once cured it does its job.  It is super a glossy and works well with nail powders and the glitter polish from this brand.  I haven't tried the base ot top coat with any other brand, just nail powder.I cured the topcoat for 1 minute under my LED light, but 30 seconds seems to do just fine.I didn't get much of a heat spike on any of these on my hands and only a tiny tingle on my toes.Appears to wear well if you only use one layer of Top coat.  If you use two and it will peel just like other no wipe top coats.  The polish has been on my main hand for over a week and it looks mostly new even after some heavy duty house chores and moving an apliance without gloves.I didn't buff the top of my nail, just cleaned with acetone and then 91% isopropyl alcohol.  Note:  make sure the alcohol or acetone is 100% gone or it will bubble.  I have a small bubble on one nail probably from jumping the polish gun and putting on the base coat before all the nail prep had evaporated."
4,great product
4,Excellent
4,"Good gel base and top.  The base is hard to remove, I end up filing it off.  Base not really soak off."
4,"Honestly the base coat is a joke; It does nothing to help, but doesn't exactly hurt my nails either. I have to use alcohol to cure it even after using my lamp. LOVE the top coat though! Super shiny!"
4,"I was skeptic about the reviews and for the price, the reviews were too good to be true. But, trust me, this one got to be the best base coat/top coat ever for everyone on a budget.The instructions need to be improved but there were written instructions in the box so nothing to worry.As many suggested, I used a very thin layer of base coat, cured it and later, I wiped it off with alcohol. Painted it with gel polish and finished with top coat and wiped with alcohol.The base coat was sticky after curing so I had used the alcohol to clean it. But, it also works the same even if you don't wipe it off. All the sticky feeling will be gone with the help of the top coat and rubbing it off with alcohol as a final step."
4,perfect - thank you :)
4,"Not terrible, but I do feel this base and top coat make my gel polish peel a bit faster at the cuticles. It looks great for the first 5 days, then slowly starts to peel up. Not terrible for the price, not salon quality, but possibly might be better duos out there."
4,I love the no wipe too coat. Saves me some time.
4,"I was pleasantly surprised on the whole Aimeili gel polish line. I have also used one of their colored polishes, and get a good 2 weeks out of it, if I apply it carefully and correctly. I have experience peeling, but I put my nails through the ringer with cleaning and wearing cleaning gloves that basically soak the nails in moisture. I have to also mention the price is unbeatable!! I was so skeptical when I first purchased Aimeili and honestly did so as I was just going to ""try out"" no chip polish at home. Turns out to be a good product.I will add that doing your own no chip at home can me super time consuming. But, it beats the cost of going to the salon. I never really respected that fact until I started doing my own. However, at the salon, a good no chip session can last up to 4 weeks if you don't freak out over the nail growth coming in."
4,"I've been sandwhiching my my old polish with great success. Lasts over a week, I haven't waited for it to chip to remove.I don't notice any funky smell like other reviewers.I have to say though, the base coat is difficult to remove. I have to do a second round of buffing and soaking to get it off, and still have to buff of the remnants.PS. You have to let your nail polish dry before you put on the top coat or it will never dry!"
4,The top coat loses its shine and scratches pretty easily
4,"Very good , small bottles"
4,"only thing is that the colors are mostly what I don't wear, I would have liked more variety.  the product is good though, stays on if you follow directions."
4,These get the job done. The top coat isn't quite as shiny as I'd like but it covers well.
4,"I really liked this gel nail polish. It makes my nails so bright and shiny which I love! I have been using some brands in the past that didn’t meet my expectations until I found this one. The only problem that I had is that the base is almost empty and the top coat is half the bottle and I always use them together. So, now I have to buy the base in order to keep using the top coat. 😏"
4,Works satisfyingly well. the top coat needs about three coats to really secure everything and 3 coats make it easy when taking the gel off.
4,Really cool that I can do this at home. Just light and done!
4,Love the colors but peels off ez on natural nails
4,Great product wish it were a little more firm but overall good.
4,Like this brand works great
4,"Base coat is great, top coat tends to chip."
4,"I felt like this uv gel base and top coat were pretty good quality. They take a little longer to cure than some of the more expensive brands I use, but I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome. The only downside is that the base coat bottle arrived cracked and it eventually broke in Hal’s spilling all of the product from mearly setting it down."
4,Wife likes it
4,"I really like these except when you coat a nail you have to immediately put it under the light, otherwise the paint/coating will start pooling up and leave parts of your nail bare. Which can be a beast when going to take the gel off if you don't realized it's happened. My nails are still damaged from the first time I used this stuff and didn't realize what happened. ( and that was three months ago... they're still growing that part out) The top coat is especially shiny and my nails typically last 2-3 weeks. I usually do a touch up top coat for extra protection on the second week."
4,look nice but the nail polish only last like 4 days.
4,"Seems to be okay. I haven't much to compare to as this is my first venture into gel nails. I will say the base coat does not cure with  my lamp, but the top coat does."
4,"Pretty good.  Once dry there are no problems with chipping or peeling.  But need to take extra time under the UV lamp.  I've used two different brand lamps and both take a while to dry.  So, be patient and you have a great polish."
4,"1st- Fast shipping 2nd- Top cost makes my polish very shiny, loved it! But that chemical smell of both base and top coat is very very strong. IT STINKS! Makes me dizzy every time I open my nail bag!"
4,"Great base and top coat. However, eventually, the top coat bottle started leaking."
4,Works well! Shipped with some product on the bottle.
4,Still sticky untill after top coat even when cooked
4,good
4,"I do enjoy the Ameili products, but I am not quite sure about the No Wipe and Base.  I will keep using it until it is done and then render by decision if I love it or still just like it."
4,Not bad for the price point
4,"Has a very strong odor , I wouldn't know if that was normal or not..but still gets the job done does what it's supposed"
4,First base/top coat of gel uv polishes I've bought.  I followed the reviews.  The base coat I cured and it stays a little sticky.  Then put on your gel polish color and cure.  the top coat cures dry - you do not have to wipe off with alcohol after. I like the shine/gloss.  Will buy this again!
4,"Seriously, the base coat is so easy to peel off. But I guess this is good for me because I was looking for a peel off base coat LOL. So if you want a peel off base coat, this is great. After my first time trying it, my nails peeled right off unexpectedly. Sure,I do pick at my nails sometimes. But I didn’t expect it to just peel right off and create a perfect shell. Smh. The top coat is okay, super thick tho. Apply a small amount because it’s thick and will make your nails look like a nail mountain lol."
4,So far I have used the product once and it works! I am very happy with the results and this will save me a lot of money because I won't have to pay to go to the nail salon :) YAY
4,"I got this set some months ago. I only use the top coat, on top of my regular polish. I do Not use this base as it looks like oil puddles (reason for 4 stars) on top of my nails 😞!  Nails look like they were done at the salon after application of this top coat! 😍 I am buying another set since my 15yo is also using it more frequently. You must cure with UV/LED light!!!!! To the company separate this set as the base coat is a mess, top coat is a hit!"
4,Good product but very runny.
4,Very happy with the UV lamp and the base and no wipe top coat.
4,"These base and top coats work great for an at home gel mani-pedi. My only issue was when i tried to soak and scrape it off, it seemed like the base layer bonded almost TOO well with my nail, and part of my nail layers scraped off. I had to take a few months break between the next gel manicure because my nails were damaged. This could just be user error or the fact that my nails are extremely thin. They held up great though, and looked beautiful."
4,it's good
4,The top coat is amazing !!! The base coat tends to separate a bit ... it would be nice it was an it shiner
4,I wish bottled were a bit bigger. They're TINY
4,This is my first gel base and top coat so I really don't have anything to compare it to.
4,"Not sure if it was the polish or UV light I got but nails hurt while they were drying. That being said, the polish works great and is super smooth. Rather hard to get off."
4,This worked great for my nails but the bottle keeps leaking. I've bought two sets already and they both leak. I've made sure that the top is closed tightly so that isn't the problem. The leaking/sticky bottle is annoying but I would still buy this again.
4,I like how the top coat is not sticky at all after curing. Top coat does not stay for very long though and base coat is a bit difficult to remove. Overall good.
4,"So far so good. I've been using this for about a month now. However, I do feel a little sting or tingle when I use the topcoat. Maybe its me or something I should do differently. Other than that the product is fine. Gets the job done."
4,Funny smell. But they work.
4,Works pretty well. I found it to work better than the gelish brand. The top coat has a really bad smell to it but it gets the job done.
4,"works well, makes polish last about 10 days."
4,"I use gel polish that does not require a base coat, so I only use the top coat. It dries down nice and hard and does not have a sticky finish. My biggest complaint is that the top coat almost separates, and does not provide an even finish. Does the job, for the most part."
4,"This was my first ever at-home gel experience, and I bought this totally on faith.  I've found it easy to use, and my nails look great and super shiny for about 10 days, before one of them peels on a corner and then it's game over, they all need to be removed before I start peeling them myself.  Seems like some people have had problems, but I just followed the directions and it was all good. My only complaint, and I'm not 100% sure this is a problem with the product, is that if I use the top coat on a pale nail color, it gets a little milky or even slightly yellow after a few days.  if anyone knows why that is, I'd totally appreciate hearing about it."
4,"I was leary of the top coat but it works!  Shiny, shiny, shiny and holds up very well.  I'm tough on my nails and this stuff works."
4,love this nail gel lit! cheap and greAT
4,"Nice pair of clippers.  Have not had them as long as some reviewers, but so far they have done well.  They came in a little pouch for storage.  The only drawback that I noticed after purchase was that the nail clipper did not include a small swing out ""file / nail cleaner""  But, these WERE advertised as clippers and are very good at clipping/trimming.  Just would have been nice to have the little tool to also clean under the nail."
4,Excellent quality. But it needs a file that extends or pivots out.
4,"These are well made and sharp blade, even has a built in file but my old fingers have a hard time pinching down enough to make them cut. A longer handle area maybe would help. Nice set, just had for me to torque for the cut."
4,Only wish the large was a tad bigger. Their large is about the size of most regular clippers.
4,"sharp, well made"
4,"These clippers are amazing. Yes they are relatively more expensive compared to the other clippers on the market, but they have a really clean, easy and satisfying cut. I'm sure that investing in one set of these clippers is the same as buying a new pair of cheap clippers every year.You also have the added benefit of never having to spend more time looking for new clippers ever again. The brand and company itself is also very customer friendly and super nice. I mean, when was the last time you heard someone talk about how nice their mail clipper brand was."
4,The finger nail clippers are wonderful. Nice crisp cut. The toe nail clipper is hard to press on my thick nails.
4,Honestly these don’t give me a crisp clean cut like a was hoping for. Not sure I get all the glowing reviews. I’ll still use them but wish they cut more cleanly. Easy to grip and nice looking design.
4,Bought primarily for toe nails and it does the job well. The quality of the clips is excellent and a great value for the price. I wish the toe nail clipper was just a bit longer but this is a minor point.
4,These work great!
4,"I Like the width of levers, easier for larger hands"
4,They are okay.  Not as sharp as I thought they would be.  Left snags in nails.
4,Initially the smaller clippers didn’t clip at all - reached out to Harperton and they bent over backwards to make things right. Very impressed. Overall they’re good clippers. Pleased with my purchase.
4,"Great nail clippers all around. Sturdy, cuts well, convenient carrying pouch, built in file."
4,Yes great
4,These clippers are very sturdy but not real heavy. The design doesn’t hurt my thumb like most of them do. They cut well. I do wish they had a wider opening for the nail to go in. Good purchase.
4,Wish they would have had the built in file - would have made it 5 stars!
4,Makes a clean cut without damaging nails
4,Sharp & works well.
4,PRETTY GOOD BUT JUST A TAD FLIMSY BUT GETS THE JOB DONE!♡♡♡♡♡♡
4,"Super happy with these. They work very well. Only complaint is that the ""file"" part is right where you hold it and it kind of irritates it a bit. I just left the blue film that comes on it, on it and then you don't notice it."
4,They seem to be reasonably sharp. The directions said to use after a shower so the nail is soft not brittle.  Seems to work well under these conditions.
4,"Well built, sharp,blades align. Just 4 stars because they don’t have a nail file."
4,"Great clippers, easy to grip, no slipping out of your hand.  Clean cutting."
4,"Very sharp, work very well, thick nails are no problem. They also have a good weight balance to them."
4,Work like they should
4,They were nice and sharp and I like the case that came with the nail clippers!!!!
4,I don't think these are anything special but they do the job.
4,"They feels solid, cut the nails well. They simply works. Thats all you want in nail clippers. :)"
4,"Didn't have a chance to use on toenails.  It too small for my big toes and I'm an average sized guy (5'8"" and 155 lbs).  Was okay with the other toes but an ever bigger version would be better."
4,Better than most clippers sold in drug stores.
4,Cut great
4,Great clippers; just wished they had the attachment for cleaning one's nails.
4,"These clippers are sharp and heavy which is good but also kind of hard to use if you’re not used to it at first.I like the built in file, but the plastic covering the file part is really hard to remove.I have used them several times and have enjoyed the experience compared to some of my other clippers."
4,Not much to say but these work a lot better than my older nail clippers.
4,These clippers are definitely top-notch.  I would have rated 5 stars but they don't have the little piece that flips out to clean underneath the nails and I really like that.
4,They are nail clippers... I don’t know if they are worth the price...
4,Best finger nail clippers I ever used for now I just wish they weren't made in China! So we shall see?!
4,"These are much easier to hold than what I've been using, but they are a bit thicker behind the edge making them a little harder to use. All in all a good purchase."
4,"I don't know. We're talking nail clippers here. I have arthritis, and will say that these do the job better than than the cheapies you can get anywhere. I'm just not sure if I can justify $15 for nail clippers. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining about $15, I just use the price/value comparison on everything. If $$15 isn't an issue, but these. They do the trick, and are easy to use for people like me. My only ""real"" complaint is that these clippers do NOT have the little flip out ""pick"" to clean under the nails that most have. The file on the backside is adequate, but doesn't clean or help cuticles."
4,They are definitely easier to hold onto and really are ergonomic.  They look wider in the picture than they really arewhich is why I chose them but I'll forgive that :)
4,"My cheap clippers are better.I've had bad cheap clippers, and I've had good ones. And if you read these reviews, you'll see people have had good expensive clippers, and others have had ones that are misaligned or the blades don't meet evenly and they get a rough edge.In other words, expensive clippers are not better than cheap clippers.When using these on my toenails, I actually have to use *more* force than when I use my cheap La Cross clippers. The same is true for my fingernails, obviously, but fingernails are easier to clip, so the difference is less noticeable. As for the edge, while these give me an OK edge, the La Cross edge is actually smoother.Here's some stuff you might not think about: 1) These clippers have a taller blade than most. This is a problem for me, because I like to use the bottom of the clippers to push skin out of the way and wedge the clippers into corners or get close underneath the nail. But because these expensive clippers have a taller blade, it's difficult to maneuver that way, and sometimes impossible. 2) These clippers have a rougher finish. Normal nickel-plated clippers are shiny and smooth, which helps them glide against the skin when maneuvering. Again, the cheap clippers win. 3) Weight. These expensive clippers are hefty, whereas cheaper clippers barely weigh anything. Up to you how much that matters. 4) Maneuverability. Cheap clippers are smaller and lighter and less thick, so it's easier to get into corners or to be able to see to press the blades up against your skin if you're, for instance, cutting a cuticle snag or a hang nail. It's nearly impossible with these expensive clippers. On top of that, the cheaper clippers do a better job cutting through skin snags than the more expensive ones.Long story short, my two- or three-dollar clippers are better in every single way. I was excited to get a better edge and have an easier time with toenails and trimming bits of skin, but the cheaper clippers are many, many, many times better in all of these areas. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on these."
4,"Got these because I read an article saying they were the best. My son has nails that grow like crazy. He said they’re nice. Sharp, they don’t pull on his nails. Don’t need to file them after clipping."
4,"they worked well, as advertised."
4,"Who would have ever thought there would be an ""amazing"" set of nail clippers? Well, these fit the bill! The hype is accurate—you won't want to use the cheap ones ever again.  So why the ""but"" in my headline? The one thing missing from these is they don't have the little pick/file tool that swings out in order to dig under your nails.  Any old set of cheap clippers have this tool, and I don't see how eliminating it from the design improves anything.  So now I have these amazing clippers, but have to keep a cheap set with them in order to do a simple grooming task.  This is, in my view, a needless oversight."
4,They do not have the little fingernail cleaner thing that some have -that is the only disappointment.I am going to get two sets for my daughters to put in their stockings at Christmas.
4,The nail cutter set looked great but not what I needed for very thick toe nail. The toe nail cutter is longer and easy to hold but works for regular nails.
4,Hard to press to cut the nail.  My old set was easier to use.
4,The clippers are worth the money (you get two pairs). I’ve had several different types of clippers from cheap to expensive. These work well (better than the cheap ones and as good as the most expensive ones - but I wouldn’t say better.)
4,Amazing nail clippers!!
4,Easy to hold but a bit small not sure if an adult man could easily use them due to smaller size.
4,Don’t take a lot of room and come with their own pouch to keep them in. Well priced
4,"In addition to the two nail clippers which work very well, you will receive a product gift.  The clippers are well packaged and come with a very nice and usable plastic zip case. It is hard to beat the product, their packaging and the company's customer service."
4,"Blades are sharp. And open up farther than regular clippers. I have a couple thick nails that have been hard to cut, untill I got these. Great product."
4,"These work OK but if I had it to do over, I'd save my money for Mr Tweezerman."
4,Be careful.  These clippers are sharp.  A small piece  of my toe is missing.  Soo much better than my old clippers
4,"I really like these clippers. They are super thick and sharp. Because of the thickness they are a little hard to fit under your fingernail, but I still like them."
4,"Seem to be excellent clippers,.  Timely shipping and nice packaging..  has a little tote bag for them too!"
4,I liked how it came in a baggie
4,"The nail clippers work pretty well.  I like the smaller one the best for my toenails.  The large clipper feels too big and trimmed my toenails unevenly.  My toenails have become thicker and more brittle with age so I was having trouble with the ""dime store"" quality clipper.  This does the job adequately.  I use a glass nail file for my fingernails."
4,"The clippers themselves are great, but my word, the packaging.  So much plastic --- including a totally unnecessary PVC storage bag.  It's 2020 guys, please reconsider your packaging choices - it's just not ok anymore."
4,These are very high-quality nail clippers.  My only negative thing about them is that it is a little bulky to other high-quality ones I used.  It clips with ease and does a very clean job.
4,"I’ve only had them a few weeks, but so far, I love them!"
4,"They worked just as well as $1 clippers, so I decided to just stick to the $1 ones. I will say that I did notice the weight to them is significant to the $1 clippers I have, they are quite lightweight. The company is very invested in the customers satisfaction with the product. They were just a little pricey and that is why I returned them. If I didn't already have good clippers, I would have surely kept them. Great product and would recommend if you don't already have good clippers!"
4,Would have given it 5 stars if it had a separate nail file.  But overall probably the nicest clipper I’ve ever gotten.
4,"I was a little surprised at the size, especially the toenail clipper. They do seem to be good quality and I've used them some and have had not problems. They work fine however."
4,Liked the sharp cutting blades. Draw back opening should be wider.
4,"they are sharp and do a good job, I just wish they were a litter bigger"
4,does the job well
4,"They're good nail clippers, wish they had a bigger size for the toe nails though.  They send a cute pouch to store the nail clippers. They seem to be a company who cares about customer satisfaction."
4,So far so good.
4,I was hoping these would cut amazingly better than the cheap dollar store clippers I’ve always had. They cut a little better. They are way more comfortable than the cheap clippers. They seem really sharp and looks like they will last for awhile.
4,Great clippers. The file is to small tho and kind of hard to use. Thats my only complaint.
4,"These nail clippers are a step above the average, cheaper, products. They aren't perfect or completely free of flaws, but they ARE very good.  I have used these several times now, and I am satisfied with their performance.  This is a good product, at a fair price."
4,Good product. Sharpness makes clipping nails easier. Recommended.
4,It’s a quality product. Nails get trimmed pretty sharply without breaking the nail.
4,Good quality
4,"The finger nail clipper is not as sharp as I expected, but the toe nail clipper definitely does not disappoint.  Quality and material substantial and aesthetically pleasing."
4,"Nails get brittle as we age. As a senior I found these clippers give a smooth and easy clip to to fingernails. I would have given it 5 stars, but I take away 1 star for being made in China."
4,"These clippers are difficult for me to review. My daughter likes them, but I found them hard to press down. I am a senior citizen with arthritis. The clippers were sharp and cut well when I could get them down far enough.  I gave them to my daughter and granddaughter who likes them. The young granddaughter was thrilled to get the fingernail clippers and the daughter likes the toenail clippers."
4,Liked the sharpness of the clippers which made clean cuts...no tugging Extra value with both fingernail and toenail cutters.
4,"Initial perceived quality is very nice, only time will tell."
4,"I would have hoped they were sharper, but they work just fine. And the price is good."
4,Fast shipping and a good product !
4,Works well.
4,I have one hand and these clippers are the best I’ve been able to use. Very sharp and make a clean cut.
4,Very good product for the price. I would recommend it.
4,Solid pair of clippers. Good grip
4,I am old and have arthritis.I had trouble holding on to a standard one because they were to small.The larger one is easier to use and I can carry the small one in my pocket without any trouble
4,Product worked as described.  I would recommend this to others.
4,Finally spent a little more money and got a better quality clipper than drug store brands.
4,Like these clippers just fine.
4,Fragrance is good
4,"I bought a bottle and wished it would be bigger, like everyone I was skeptical at first but the fragrance smells nice  and I like to think since I started using I have seen a change in the way people look at me a little more liking to my persona …Pheromones are real and so is science invest into the results you want !!"
4,Product smells great for about 1-2 hours but only projects about 2 ft maybe 3 if just applied ..after about 2 hours some one will only smell this if giving you a hug ..love the scent but wish it lasted longer and the scent would project more than 2-ft
4,"It is a very pleasant smelling cologne.It is oil based, making it a true cologne.It is not an aftershave, there is no alcohol in it.The ""Pheromone"" aspect seems like a marketing ploy to get teenage boys to buy it.  I'm in my 30s and don't really want to be seen as juvenile.  I tried it anyway since people can only smell it, and not read the branding.  Glad I did too, one of the better smelling colognes I have.  I wouldn't recommend applying it like you're painting, the oil is very noticable on fine fabrics.  I've been treating it like perfume.  Spray it into the air, making an aerosolized cloud, then walk into the cloud.  That way it's not concentrated into one area but dispersed around the entire chest, arms and neck.  I've been spraying it ahead of me while I walk between rooms when getting ready.  It is not very strong and takes a few sprays to achieve a noticeable scent at intimate distances."
4,"Smells wonderful, almost intoxicating but not sure if the pheromones work. But who cares when the smell is so great still have people coming up and complimenting me"
4,I liked it cause it has pleasantly rusty smell. Idk how to explain but it's a good experiment.
4,good scent
4,Was skeptical about this product but seems to smel good and lasts a while. 1 or 2 sprays and your good for your entire date. Smell is not over whelming and the women seems to like it as well.
4,Seems like a decent cologne.  Slightly flowery to me.  But not too much.  Will Definitely use it and price was affordable.
4,Gr8t smell and I have noticed women smelling me and telling me I smell good . The rest is up to your character and game to draw the deal to get laid.
4,I get all the women 😎
4,"Great price, great product, lovely scent!"
4,"I like this cologne beczuse it's not overpowering. Plus I mix it with strong scented colognes, and I helps control the overall scent. This is my 2nd bottle, I'll definitely buy it again"
4,"Second purchase because the first one smelled stale and rather nauseous the longer I wore it. DO NOT waste even one hard earned dollar for something that I have tried twice thinking it was a bad batch the first time. Now I'm out a double order not fit for even a four legged squirrel. Im telling you guys, please get your $ back before their return policy expires and you are stuck with it.experience. Might work for our moms, because they think we are all cute ""boys""  anyway no matter what we smell like. While we do thank our moms for being sweet this stuff has no more allure than say any type of road kill. Just being honest gentleman."
4,Yea pay for what yea get but it smell pretty good I love it so does my girlfriend
4,Its a unique cologne that is very different from my other ones I own. I find the scent pleasant and long lasting but as the day wears on the musk smell of it makes me think I’m starting to have BO but I guess thats the pheromones. Also the cologne is very oily so be careful when you apply it. First time I put it on I didn’t realize it and I ended up with oil spots on my shirt. I was just looking for a different cologne from what’s currently on the market so this fits the bill. I have not noticed any difference of opposite sex noticing me wearing this cologne which also includes my wife so take that with a grain if salt. Also I do find the bottle to pretty small for what you pay so I will not using it very often.
4,"Smells good, packaged well, recommend buying"
4,Love the smell. Sometimes it will leave residue so best to apply to skin not clothes. Awesome scent!!
4,I like the smell and have received a few compliments. Bottle should last a long time because a little goes a long way.  Still haven’t had any advancements from women. 🥺
4,Good One
4,"It smells nice, I just wish it wasn’t a spray."
4,Awesome scent. Doesn’t last all day though. Didn’t “attract” anymore than a great scent cologne. Overall I was pleased because it smells great.
4,Smells great but doesn’t last long at all
4,Nice scent women do notice
4,"Got my haircut after wearing this, and the Lady spent extra time styling. No overpowering scent, great spray, perfect to keep in pocket. Great bang for buck."
4,Haven't showered in months. This helps.
4,"Have you ever smelled “fierce” by Abercrombie? It smells the same. The best way I can describe this scent is Abercrombie+a tiny bit of a peppery note. Not in a bad way, that’s just the only difference I can make of it. Also I know Abercrombie has like 6 “fierce” scents out now but the scent I’m referring to is the original scent. The one you smell walking past the store through the mall. Yeah you know which one I’m talking about."
4,Go ahead and buy it. The scent is very unique and doesn't seem to have a base note ingredient that I can put into words. Worth the money. Great to have for those subtle and sophisticated days. And definitely a winner for a night with the significant other especially if she doesn't like overpowering smells. My wife says 8/10.Single men: This aptly named pheromone is for AFTER you get the girl's attention. Or if you are in a smaller setting. Another guy might outshine you with with a traditional cologne if you are trying to compete in a public setting. It won't make the ladies come running to you UNLESS you have a bright personality or appearance.Hint: it actually enhances the smell of other colognes like a catalyst. I put a TINY HINT of another cologne after applying RawChemistry and it was very nice.
4,Smells really good havent gotten to test it yet.
4,It smells good and seems nice so far. I'll update later if things change.
4,Arrived quickly. I think it smells good. The scent has good longevity meaning I don’t have to re-apply all day.
4,Smells great. Haven’t noticed any difference on women around me but it does smells good. So if anything it smells great!
4,WONDERFUL
4,Great clean scent
4,Great smelling scent... highly recommended!
4,It’s last really long. I haven’t gotten the ‘wow’ factor yet but in the 1 week I’ve used it there has been positive feedback from women
4,Smells good and lasts longer than cheap cologne. But not going to be an all day thing.
4,Excellent scent. I have been using it for almost a year and my wife love it. I wish the scent would last longer.Francisco
4,First time user and so far I'm really liking it. It definitely has a bold scent that last all day! I'm I'm very eager to try more of their products such as their jaguar black! Definitely a great product and they value is incredible!
4,It's a good scent
4,It smells great!!
4,The bottle came half empty. it smells incredible and lasts a long time however id like to recieve a replacement or somehing along those lines
4,"Pretty Good, would like some more scent variety, but overrall positive so far"
4,I loved that the scent last a very long time and the women love it!
4,"Haven’t used it a whole lot yet, but it smells very good and it’s a good value. Can’t wait to try it out!"
4,"The scent does not last long and needs to be reapplied, but when the wife smelled it, she liked it. I would not say it generated any activities above what we normally do, but still enjoyed it."
4,"Received my product in about 2 days, super quick. I was super excited about trying this as my pheromone cologne I usually get got discontinued (Max Attract Hypnotic) so I'm super biased towards the Max Attract so don't take my word 100% and try it for yourself. That being said I thought it smelt pretty good (just a little bit more musky), and I like more of a citrus scent I guess (Versace Pour Homme, Nautica) so this is a little musky for me. But I really like it. I've had a few ladies say they really like it. The longevity is like 6-8 hours of solid smell and I still smell it on my clothes after that. I heard it's made in Oregon (which I've been born and raised) so I had to buy it and try it out. I was really happy and would buy more in the future and I really want to try their moisturizer/lotion now!"
4,"Fast shipping, smells good, just received it, will update later, after had time to try it it out. :)"
4,Trying to get my sample kit. We will see how good this is.
4,"I was looking for something that had a long lasting scent, this did it I can put it on in the morning and at night after work I still smell great, and it's a good price to"
4,I love the scent attracts woman not really but still amazing wish it came in a bigger bottle
4,Not overpowering.  Not overpriced.  I Like that it is  a small business and made by hand.
4,Great smell unsure what to expect from the pheromones part
4,Guys this is not no gimmick this actually works it drives my lady crazy she cant keep her hands off me i love it i can only imagine what ladys think when in public if i was you gents get a bottle and give a try cause rember it mixes with your pheromones and thats the chemistry behind all colonge mixing with you and produces a sent that triggers arousle in ladys
4,I expected woman to get butt naked as soon as I walked in the room while wearing this.... That did not happen but it still smells pretty good and last pretty long
4,"Great product. Even in a gross anatomy dissection, got girls commenting on how good the cologne smelled. Only problem is that it’s very strong when initially applied and after about 2 hours is much much weaker, so have to be careful around people with perfume allergies when trying to put it on to last for the day."
4,The scent is the reason women like it. Women enjoy smells of a more natural variety and this cologne sums of that smell quite well it's very good for the price also
4,Scent is okay. Lasts for a good while. I expected more.
4,Smells nice and works well. My wife loves when I wear it!
4,Love the smell! My partner loves it! Only issue i have is that i wish it was bigger for the price but its amazing!.
4,My girlfriend still doesn't love me anymore but I guess you can't bottle miracles. Atleast I like the way I smell! Worth the money.
4,Wish it lasted longer and was a bit less oily other than that I'm pleased with this purchase.👍
4,I'm not sure how well the pheromones work but it smells great.
4,This product is easy to apply snd smells like a million bucks.
4,Kinda oilySmells like petoulie oil from 1969
4,"I like it, i just wish the scent would last longer."
4,"Nice smell, seems effective, but way too small for the price!"
4,"Smells GREAT, package design ""Awesome"", Size okay for the price.. It doesn't last long unfortunately.. I am really hoping for the best with the item, as describe.. I know it's not a Genie in a bottle, but one can only hope.. It is oil base, so that's a plus"
4,"Great smell, and my lady loves it"
4,Fine
4,"This is no magic. I go on Tinder dates and I'm an average looking guy but also a great conversionalist. If you are not confident and don't have good talking skills to get the girl to like you in the first place, this perfume won't do it for you. Now, it is true that most girls get insanely crazy with the perfume. They sniff me and give me complementets about it. This is once she's in my couch already which means she already likes me a bit at least so the perfume just secures the night for me! It's like a closer pitcher in a baseball game. Only complain is that it doesn't last too long. I believe 3-4 hours maximum. (May attract the girl's pet as well). Could be cheaper too."
4,"Scent stimulates females subconsciously for their, and your benefit!"
4,I can feel the oil blend and not just overly diluted like some others.  Smells clean.  great looking packaging.I will adjust the stars based on my use.
4,"Everything so far, is great!"
4,"I don’t know anything about the ladies or any pheromone stuff, but it does smell good. It’s good to use as a mixer for less expensive fragrances. Noticeable and a couple good compliments but no more than I usually would get from other luxury brands."
4,Wife loves it. Could last longer. Watch getting it on your shirt/clothes... doesn't dissolve/dry easily.
4,Received it as a birthday gift. Very nice and attractive scent 👍
4,"So, I'm not saying it guarantees an edge in social interactions, but it's definitely helped me. Whether it's a placebo effect or the scent is truly enticing to everyone, I'm not sure..."
4,Don't for one second think that this will mentally lure women. This may get there attention as it's a very good masculine sent. But your not going to be fighting women off if you use this marketing ploy.HOWEVER: This does smell great and I would buy it again because of that.On the down side it does not have a long lasting aroma.Also even keeping this bottle in the good packaging it came in the bottle ended up leaking and wasting 1/4 of the bottle.
4,"Girl I wanted to impress said it smelled great !  I also think it smells great !!  Can't wait to try it on others . It's GOTTA  help this old , fat , white guy .I also agree with another reviewer , nothing is as good as Funky Cold Medina  !!!"
4,No one ever comments about it but when asked I’ve been told it smells like that famous mall store private label brand Ambercromby & Finch. I get much more compliments by using creed but that’s a more expensive boutique brand by several hundreds of dollars for the real stuff.
4,I like this product a lot. Has a very good scent. Not overbearing but subtle. Wish it was in a larger size though.
4,Couldn’t see much of a difference thought. It’s all in your mind I guess. Being honest. You have to be looking to find.
4,Smells like a mix between chrome and cool water with a warmer side to it.
4,"Didn't tell my wife I switched cologne and waited for her reaction.  While she said I smelled good, there was no out of the ordinary attraction.  The scent is very pleasant and not overwhelming but does not last very long.  Overall, nice smelling cologne for a fair price vs. Department store brands."
4,"I like this product very much, I just wish the scent would last !!"
4,Good smell and last long time as well.
4,I like it a lot. I personally haven’t seen any differences in my interactions with women but it’s definitely something I will buy in the future.
4,"Not positive it turned me into the kitty slayer it implies but, I really like the scent myself. A little goes a long way. Pricey. Have purchased three bottles so far. Have gotten positive comments about it from a few women."
4,Smells very good and seems to last. Will see if there’s any truth the effects on other people with the whole pheromone thing.
4,Smells nice. Haven’t used it yet to determine if it truly works. I’ll let you know how the wife reacts to it when I do decide to wear it.
4,"So, I looked up best colognes for 2020. This popped out as number one and with a link directly to Amazon. It was cheap, so I said why and ordered it. Did know it was ""pheromones"" lol but it last long and smells nice. Don't know bout the ""pheromones"" though."
4,"Smells amazing to me and the price was right, just wished it lasted a little longer."
4,"this product smells good, but I notice zero difference in attraction with or without it.  Better to stick with simply exercising, eating right, sleeping properly, and using the money you would have spent on this for a gym membership to be physically in better shape and thereby more attractive and healthier."
4,Gr8 4 laying up wit yo boo thang
4,A little to oily but it smells very nice...
4,Liked fresh scent
4,"Just bought this one for a special surprise to my wife. My loves it when I wear a nice perfume everytime we go out on a date. Decided to buy this because its all natural, not crazy checmical mixes or what not. I tried it first snd smelled it myself, smells good. Some of the reviews suggest to put or mixe some other perfume to make smell more appealing. But for me itself is enough and doesnt need to mix with anything else. Right now the wife is out of town when this arrived, will using it when I get to pick her and see her reaction when she smells this. Thank you RawChemistry for a wonderful product, I will be looking forward in doing another order from you soon."
4,Good stuff. Smells great. Thanks!
4,Price and size. Smell nice and pimpish.
4,"I love the smell, but it seems like it fades pretty fast throughout the day. I'd say it's longevity is about 3 hours, which is good for dates, bad for full days."
4,Overall I think this a good product for guys who want to enhance their natural scent. The scent lasts for a few hours at a time.  I would recommend putting in on in the morning and again in the evening if you're going out.
4,Smells nice. Scent remains longer than expected.
4,"This product has a fresh soap like aroma. It lasts all day. It's a great scent and a great value. So far, i have not had large groups of women try to make out with me, but i still like to smell good."
4,"I enjoy the scent, as far as it attracting more attention from women goes, I seem to get hit on a lot more lately. I’m not sure if it’s the cologne or I’m just more aware of flirtatious acts when I am wearing it. In any case, I’m going to keep using it. I will report back when I have a definitive answer."
4,Lots of compliments
4,"In all honesty it has a nice smell... there is nothing about this product I dislike, atleast not yet, I'm only 3 days in"
4,"Overall it is a great smelling cologne.. I work in an office and service serval clients on a day to day basis, what I would call a perfect testing ground for this product. So here’s the scoop:I don’t know if it is more of a boost in confidence which may lead to favoritism amongst clients Of opposite sex or the pheromones but  I did notice on a couple of occasions where a friendlier more playful mood was evoked which sometimes a playful touch or two was noticed.It doesn’t seem to work with all women but the ones it did work with I noticed an almost hypnotic like state where the smell seemed to capture the subject and send them to the moon and back.I wish it came in a larger size.. 2 applications a day for longevity..it is oil based so watch out for oils stains (which wash out).I’m most likely going to buy again."
4,"I like it, my Wife loves it."
4,well i like it. smells like soap or simular smells clean and manly at the same time. it has a more notacable smell than another product. i like it too. but it fades fast
4,"Good value, great scent"
4,The smell is great I usually add a little to skin and it will last awhile. Some compliments. It has worked to a degree.
4,Smells great and long lasting
4,"First things first- This is not some magic potion that will make women swarm on you, ok? Want to attract women?Shower, wear nice clothes and nice shoes when you go out(NOT sneakers no matter how ""expensive"" they are), spritz on a little of this cologne, keep your head up, shoulders back, don't brag about anything, listen to people when they talk so you hear WHAT they are saying and not for what you can say next, be confident but not arrogant!Now on to the cologne- It's got a very nice scent. Imagine that Cool Water has a laid back cousin that lives in the forest. It's not a sharp scent like Cool Water but instead has a smooth, sweet, light musky, woodsy/forest smell. But that doesn't mean the scent is weak, it is a strong scent, just smoother on the nose. I think that is part of what makes it so good because it is strong yet smooth and noticeable but not overpowering.A couple of squirts will go a long way and last all night. Since it is oil based DO NOT squirt it on your clothing! What I do is squirt it on my palms and then dab/rub it on my neck and then finish wiping the rest on my arms and wrists. If you squirt it directly on yourself I'd recommend doing it before you put a shirt on and because it's oil based I'd also recommend rubbing it in with your hands to help spread it out and help it to absorb so there's no oily spots on your skin that may transfer to your shirt.All in all, it's a great cologne and women really do love the scent but that doesn't mean they'll undress for you."
4,"To atrack more women, be noticed more and it did seem to work. Had compliments on the nice scent."
4,"smells great, but I’ve owned much better. Just a standard cologne. I also noticed it only lasted about 2-3 hours meaning you run out quickly. I would say the reviews overhyped it."
4,"Smell is appealing for my tastes, decent price. As far as the pheromone portion of it didn't seem to do anything; but the fragrance and price make it a good buy"
4,"All together a pretty good product, was a little oily if you're not careful"
4,"Smells good, lasts about 2 hours"
4,Very nice scent only thing I didn't care for was how oily it is
4,My wife likes this.  A lot!
4,Second order. This scent has had a strange effect around the office. And it’s an effect that makes me very happy. Sorry. Not going to explain further. Just know that it an be used as a tactical tool.
4,Smells very similar to Cool Water by Davidoff.
4,Like the smell
4,Very good
4,Nice smelling but doesn't last.
4,"Great and potent scent, but I assumed that it will stay a bit longer!"
4,Smells nice?
4,Smells great biggest question is does it work? well. Used it a whole weekend goes on oily so after shower type of cologne. Smells fresh so it can be mixed. Wife didn’t know I was wearing it. But I did see a spike in her arousal easier to get going. Does it attract maybe to soon to tell but is it making her more into me yes but you gotta have them close
4,"Smells great, good for casual or formal wear. I'd say for me it differently gives me a confidence boost! Great purchase."
4,Eh. Smells good but I can say for sure idk about the “pheromones” in it. Smells really good just I’d advertise it more or less as a regular cologne
4,Smelled nice. A bit strong... but I probably sprayed too mich
4,Got compliments
4,"I'd definitely say people are more ""open"" with me when I wear this. I did notice more interaction with women and men (which was weird). Who knows! There could be something to it! Scent is 'okay'. I'd like it to be something a little different. Just kinda smells like a clean shower smell. Nothing like a premium cologne. It's not offensive but could be better."
4,"This cologne smells awesome! It doesn’t give off a overly strong scent, rather it’s pleasant. It has a slight musky scent to it, but just the right amount. Since it is not infused with strong scented chemicals, the longevity of it may not be as long as those that are. Nevertheless, I believe to have made a great decision for someone who rarely applies cologne!"
4,Loved the scent but faded faster than I’m use to.
4,"Great smelling product, just wish it lasted a little longer!"
4,Pretty good Attack....Haha
4,"The product lies insofar as claiming to magically attract women. This is incorrect. Humans do not excrete or recognize sex pheromones. This is a complete lie. However, the cologne is cheap, subtle, and smells decent. If you want cheap cologne, this is a great option. If you want to magically attract women, go to the gym, take a shower, and lower your standards."
4,smells very good just wish it would project out more and last longer. But I believe they have a stronger version of it overall pretty good.
4,Unprovable effects or results. Smelled nice like a good quality aftershave lotion.
4,everybody liked it... but.... it lie putting on baby oil
4,"I received several compliments. It is an oil so t leaves an oily film on you, but not bad. I recommend it"
4,"Listen, honest review. I dont know where all these other reviews came from but its not a magic potion. Got it and wore around the house for a while and waited for the wife to notice. 1 day later she said hey is that a new cologne? It smells good. Thats it lol. She wasn't jumping on me, i didnt see an extra twinkle in her eye lol. Overall, it does smell nice. Something i cant put my finger on. Another cologne iv had in the past. Almost like Armani-Mania. It is oily. I dont use the spray i just unscrew and put a dab behind my ears, under arms and sometimes behind the knees. Mixes well with my other cologne without being overwhelming. Does not last long tho and i never sprayed on clothes due to other reviews stating it ruined them. Bottom line. Its a nice, clean smelling cologne. If you want girls. Just start with a hi my name is....confidence is key. Dont think you need a smart pick up line. Just be respectful."
4,Be careful how much you put on the formula is very strong. I work in retail and it helps keep customers happy. since I have been using this product my bosses have been nicer and so have the customers. people are more excepting of your opinion you become the Alpha.
4,"Easy to apply by the drop, resulting in no waste."
4,Good product smells good.
4,"No complaints.  Not sure about any 'extra' side effects, but smells pretty good and women have mentioned it a few times."
4,nice product nothing overpowering
4,I liked it
4,Scent is good.
4,"It's a great product. It wont attract any of the female species just like that, only women who are already interested in you, who normally would get close to you, then they would love the smell. It's attractive to them.So it's upto to you get the women to talk to you and move closer.Hope you get the hunch.I liked the product and I have ordered another one."
4,I like this product it smells nice idk about the attraction thing but I would like to think it it helps. Spray it on after a shower girlfriend says she likes it.
4,Large bottle should last a while.  Great scent.  I like it.
4,My wife hates when I wear cologne but for some reason this does not make her gag.  She likes the way it smells on me.  She said it reminds he of the ocean.  I like the crisp smell and it also reminds me of the beach.
4,"Nautica Voyage is a classic summertime scent.  Fresh and aquatic, Voyage is great deal for its price point.  Great sillage and longevity for what you pay.  Not a dress up scent but great for casual summertime days."
4,The product arrived with a Crack down the side of the cap. It wouldn't seal to the top at all so was able to get a total refund. The cologne is great for work or just everyday use.
4,"This is one of the best aquatic cologne I have come across. It's cheap and you can wear it on daily basis, especially in summers. I would definitely recommend it."
4,"I liked the smell and the scent, but it did not last as long as I thought it would"
4,"Simple enough. A lot of green apple and a little cedar up front, fading to spicier tones over the course of a few hours. I like it well enough for casual wear."
4,"I don’t like scent on myself, but everyone else likes very much, longevity is good"
4,Love it! BUT it is spraying in a straight line.
4,It really impressed me for that small amount of money compared to sume that cause more and not smelling like this one or even close like this
4,Great scent for the low price compared to other brands
4,"Good scent, could last a bit longer. For the price I'd buy it again if I run out."
4,"I personally thought it would smell a bit different, but it doesn't smell bad at all. It has a quite masculine scent for summer. Doesn't last long though. But it's so cheap that I personally decided to use it while at home to make myself smell better and feel a bit refreshed. for $12 it costs, I think it's a really good fragrance to abuse at home."
4,"Smell is very fresh, young, but should be a bit more rich"
4,The scent is definitely what you get for what you payed. and you get a lot more than what i thought it would be. all in all if your on a budget it’s a great cologne
4,Scent is amazing. Doesn't last that long but the scent makes up for that
4,Its a fresh sent.Stays awhile
4,Great scent and value for the money
4,This was a gift for my significant other.  I was pleased at the large size for the price!  The fragrance was nice not very over powering.  Recommend for the value!
4,"It's a good deal, it has a good and sweet smell. Girls Love it.🥰"
4,Really love the scent. Only downside is that the perfume scent only lasts for 2 to 3 hours. Still good value for the money.
4,"This is one of my favorite scents and i definitely recommend it, however especially on here the price has gone up. I used to buy it in store and on here between 10 - 14 bucks anything more than that well your over paying for it."
4,no bad
4,Very nice scent that last.
4,"This smells amazing. I just wish it was stronger. For the price, it’s a buy!"
4,"This stuff is STRONG. I purchased it for my son and he used his typical amount and about knocked me over. I told him to use much less next time and when I wasn't being bowled over by such strong scent, I could smell the layers of it which is actually very nice. I guess the plus is that it will last longer than others. Not bad."
4,"The scent of this cologne is fresh all season wear. It does last a bit maybe around 5 hours, depending how you spray and where you spray. It’s really good  for what you pay for, so if you’re in doubt I say to go for it:)"
4,Bought this for my husband and I love the fresh clean scent.Have read other reviews where people though they got a knock off product but don't think that mine was because it smells great and lasts a good few hours.
4,"Nice scent, doesn’t last that long though."
4,"Another of the classic Nautica scents that is timeless. I have several of the Nautica sprays including this one and I enjoy all of them. I oten receive complement or inquiry on what it is.....Could be the Nautica.....could be I'm 6'3"" and chizzled......could be both......You decide what works for you!"
4,Excellent product and a good price. Smells nice and an overall solid cologne.My only problem is that it doesn't last very long. Other than that this is a pretty damn good cologne. 4/5
4,Update:Not sure what happened when I initially sprayed this a few days ago but since then it smells exactly like the one I bought previously. I don't know if the truck ride did something and it needed to settle but its fine now.
4,I like. First time buying this. Just give it a try. But it’s really turned out good will buy again
4,great
4,But it is somewhat overhyped. Just raised your budget to $40 to $50.00 and you will have tones of options available to you which will far superior to this one.
4,I like the smell and so does my girl.
4,Sent fresh
4,Nice scent good price
4,It has a fresh smell
4,It smells nice i just thought it would last a bit longer. Other then that for the price I think this fragrance is definitely worth it.
4,"I took a chance on this after seeing some ppl say it wasn't authentic but as it was sold and shipped by amazon themselves, I gave it a try.and I absolutely love it. my girl commented right away that she liked it.I put it on after showering and it was still kicking 3-4 hours later.great for the price. nice fruit/sea scent. good size for the value.I would suggest you give it a go too."
4,"I bought it for a friend. He says he loves it, but the scent fades quickly. I'm not sure how long it lasts before you have to apply more."
4,Cheap but good smell
4,For more of a anytime cologne when you ain't doing anything and just want to have a good cologne on.
4,Smells great and got faster then expected
4,I like the smell but it doesn't have long lasting
4,Got this for my man it smells so good product came brand new and in perfect condition I will definitely buy it again
4,He liked it!!
4,Good value. Glad I purchased.
4,"I have been out of this cologne for a while. And I happened upon it on Amazon. For me, It is the best smell. I've been wearing it for a very longtime"
4,good smooth smell. received faster then expected
4,The scent is great although it doesn’t last to long but still for the price it’s great just wished it lasted more than an hour
4,Nice smell 👃
4,Okay. First things first. To whoever says this scent disappears you’re obviously apply cologne wrong. Yes it fades slightly but all colognes around this price range do. It’s been about 45-50 mins and i can still smell it while writing this review. After doing my research this product doesn’t seem to be “fake” in any way. I recommend this product. If you don’t like it then don’t buy it again. However for me when this bottle dries up I’m gonna be buying another. Price was worth it. Can’t thank my gym buddy enough for putting me on this fantastic cologne.
4,"OK, it does not last long but its fresh and smells nice. For that price its OK and worth the money."
4,pleasant aroma and slightly striking but with a delicate smell
4,"I get lots of compliments on this one, and its a great value."
4,I've smelled better
4,It’s a good value for money.
4,This is a good cologne for the money.
4,I bought this for my husband for his birthday and let's just say he likes the finer things in life and he loves this cologne. It smells good and the scent lasts.
4,"The cologne smells nice, but after a little while the scent get's really light"
4,"Excellent, masculine scent with good projection, silage and longevity. Great for daily, casual and formal use."
4,Good price smells great
4,It was okay it was worth it but I smelled better Nautica before
4,"This cologne isn't my favorite but it does have a clean, upbeat and decent scent to it and I do enjoy wearing it as a casual cologne. It wouldn't be in my top 5 cologne choices but that is just my opinion. It is a decent cologne."
4,smells delicious.  girls love that sweet&fresh smell.... been told that a lot.
4,My favorite Nautica cologne  love it and so do  the ladies.many compliments
4,A nice clean fragrance at a reasonable price
4,Arrived in two days.Twenty bucks cheeper than Koles store.Wife says i smell good.
4,It was a gift.
4,"The king of cheap men’s fragrances.  At first I thought it smelled like a weird cucumber body spray but as time went by it grew on me and now it is my daily wear scent.  It’s fresh, crisp and energizing.  The smell makes me want to be active.  I wear it to work and the gym.  In my opinion it’s the best bang for your buck fragrance out there and it’s unique.  There really isn’t anything that smells like this, sure there’s stuff in the same category but when I smell this on someone else I know exactly what fragrance it is."
4,I like the price
4,"This smells similar to socal by hollister, but add a crisp apple note to it. Decent performance and great scent."
4,I enjoy the fresh scent and it's not overwhelming.
4,"Very good smell, could have lasted a bit longer after initial spray. Mine lasts a cool 6 hours at close range. No compliments yet tho except by myself."
4,Jeremy Fragrance brought me here 🤣
4,Good for the value
4,Good everyday scent. My lady likes it
4,The scent is great  !  Just wished it would last longer ... At least for the whole day ...but at least it last over half the day which is fine with me... I would recommend this product .. you get quite a bit for the price .
4,"Nice cologne, smells nice but doesn’t last very long..."
4,"Smells great, scent last all day.Looks just like the picture in advertisement.Not sure why some people are saying it's fake along with saying the scent doesn't last."
4,"Great value for money. Fresh, good for heavy summers."
4,Scent is great
4,Price is good
4,Good for those who are allergic to smells. It's hardly noticeable.
4,I was not too sure on buying this cologne at first but I’m glad I did it’s a great soothing calm sense that last and I get a lot of complaints when I have it on all together a great buy
4,"Nice subtle but appealing scent.  Received a couple compliments already. Doesn't last very long (seemingly about a couple hours) but reasonable price for a pleasant ""date"" cologne."
4,Bought it for a friend
4,"The scent is strong but fades quite fast. About 2 hours later, don't really smell it very much. But actually happy that this one has a half life that's so short.. I think I would be really tired of the scent if it was any heavier and stuck around all day. Enjoy"
4,"I like the scent, to me I get light melon and citrus notes."
4,I just love how mild  the smell like a fresh out of the shower type of cologne
4,Great cologne for the money
4,Good product for your money.
4,"if you want a cheap but elegant products, this is the one."
4,I researched the sellers. I purchased a bottle last year and smelled terrible.Research before you buy because the scent is great!! Get a lot of compliments!!
4,Super aroma
4,Nice smell. Good value.
4,Scent is more or less for a collage frat kid at a party. Makes an impression for 15min. Not bad for the price at all.
4,Thought I'd try a different scent since i like other Nautica colognes. It smells nice and lasts long. Shipped fast and undamaged. Only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is that the pump is a little funny and spritzes instead of an even mist or spray. Besides that i like it and i would recommend it. Overall i am happy with this purchase.
4,"It's such a great smell for so cheap. However, it doesn't last as long and has low projectivity. Just know what you're getting! I love it though."
4,Always liked and will buy again.  Why can't theychange duration of scent? Every ones complaint.
4,"I like its soft smell, light scent, not like cheap fragrant. It's good."
4,"I do like the scent and I do get compliments on the scent as well, you really don’t need more then 2 sprays for the whole day definitely worth the purchase I will buy again"
4,Has a clean smell. Good for an everyday perfume.
4,"I like it as an everyday scent and it does its job, smell good"
4,I have purchased and used Nautica several times and every time I get it I get very much satisfied with the product. It smells very good and lasts up to 3 to 4 hours. This scent has been very helpful to me and gives me the confidence. To get this scent at this price is worth it. I will be buying it in the future and I hope the quality will remain the same.
4,Got this for my son smells great but it starts off strong  just spray a little it goes a long way
4,Great value.
4,Fresh clean crisp scent though fades quickly and doesnt last..
4,great product by Nautica for men. Smells good
4,I've always liked Nautica songs a no Brainer to repurchase
4,"Ok this stuff smells good but it’s the average middle aged man cologne, so if you like it I would recommend."
4,Best value work/casual spring to summer scent. I combine mine with an oil to maximize effectiveness.
4,"It smells nice, doesn’t last long but smells nice. Last around 2 or 3 hours"
4,Perfect cheap but good smelling. Value for the money for sure. I work construction and it is perfect for the job. Not too pricey and a good smelling cologne for the price.
4,A good overall scent. Good value
4,Arrived on time and smells great
4,"I bought this for the first time because of good price. It is a very light fragrance, maybe too light for some men. It doesn't stay too long, but it smells clean and fresh. Need to apply about every 3-4 hours. I would recommend it for short time wear. For the price I am very happy with it."
4,It's a great affordable birthday gift for any friend
4,Smells very fresh out the shower beach scent with slight citrus note. About a 5 foot projection and last about 5 hours maybe 6 in 3 to 5 sprays. For those who like smelling good on a budget without drawing the attention of the entire room.
4,I smell like a dad now
4,"The scent doesn’t last long but it’s low cost and fresh scent make it well worth it, great for when you want a scent to freshen up without spending a lot on more expensive options"
4,My husband bought this for an every day wear. He smells good ☺️
4,"This is a great value.  You get a large amount of spray cologne that has a wonderful honeydew melon/green apple kind of scent.  It doesn't last all day; however, it lasts a couple of hours for me and as I use this as a pick-me-up that works fine."
4,I like it because of the scent.
4,Smells good but on problem I had was it attracted way too many flies when I sprayed it. I only use it during the winter times because of it.
4,"Smells amazing for the price. I guess the price is low because the product doesn’t smell good for very long like other, more expensive colognes would. Overall a great cologne for a great price."
4,"I was a little skeptical about ordering fragrance online, afraid that it would have been at the end of a long shelf life, but the Nautica was a pleasant surprise.  Even though the Nautica brand is at least over 10+ years old, it still has that very clean and citrusy scent.  Perfect for the hot summer months.  I sprayed two squirts and it lasted several hours, so I am really pleased with this product.  You simply can't beat a decent cologne at this pricepoint nowdays.  A+"
4,Love it  smell is soft this is actually my second order will be buying more
4,Nice perfume
4,best price
4,The scent is a little too strong
4,I always get compliments on the scent of this cologne
4,"I had to rewrite my review after wearing this a few times. At first it seemed too harsh and synthetic, but it has really grown on me. The performance is better than the vast majority of fragrances I own, which is especially rare for such an inexpensive, summer-evoking scent. I plan on buying another bottle when I get through this one."
4,"This is a classic in the perfume world. Has a sweet, fresh scent that can be used for after a shower or can be sprayed around your room to give it a fresh smell. I typically use this as a daily even when im at home and sometimes spray it around my room."
4,"For the price this is a really nice colone. I docked a star cause it slightly has a generic shampoo smell, but it is nice nevertheless. It lasts a while and isn't over powering."
4,it smells nice not to over powering
4,"Smells nice and mild. Sort of a fresh sweet scent. It does not last long though. It lasts about 2-3 hours. But still, is such a nice fragrance for the price."
4,"Good smell,  recommend"
4,"Your significant other/girlfriend/boyfriend or even animal will keep coming back to you after smelling you for the first time. They will wonder what cologne you're wearing and want to try it for themselves.An absolute MUST to buy for guys looking for an affordable , fantastic smelling cologne."
4,If you are looking for a light scent that is not overpowering. I would recommend this cologne. This is a good everyday cologne.
4,Great scent but doesn't have the staying power of a DG light blue or Issy.
4,"First time purchasing a Nautica brand cologne. Had never smelled it before, but I had just ran out of my normal everyday cologne. I was looking for something a little different and came across Voyage. It had tons of gleaming reviews and $15 for a 3.4oz bottle was a steal. The smell is very fresh. Hints of fruit with a light musky after smell. I really liked it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the longevity, in my experience is only about 3 hours. After than the cologne is hardly noticeable unless you literally have your face where you sprayed it earlier. But hey, for the price that's to be expected."
4,It has a light smooth smell for everyday wear has a light smell like the ocean for a good price
4,"It is good scent and pretty decent smell , and ut last atleast half day with keeping me fresh."
4,It is a good product for the price. It does not smell like a cheap scent even though it is.It is a good scent for summer.
4,Smells pretty good but don't last as long as I was expecting
4,Great for the price point
4,Very pleasant fresh clean scent. Excellent value to price ratio.
4,"I love it, better than expected"
4,It is ok
4,"Very soothing and confident smell. Could be a tad bit better when it comes to mildness. Smells more like a fruit, would like it to be more manly."
4,Great product for price
4,"great gift for grandson,,,seems to be happy"
4,I love the smell.  Last longer then I thought.  But not as long as the expensive ones.  But still enough.  Love the smell
4,"Great product, a perfect every day cologne with a crisp and fresh scent not overwhelming the price is awesome for this product. My only complaint the smell doesn’t last more than a few hours"
4,It’s good for how much it costs.  Not as good as Polo.  Works fine.
4,"First time trying this, and I can see why people like the scent. My only issue is there’s a slight underlying alcohol smell."
4,"This fragrance really Surprised me it smells great and it lasts a long time, Smells like a fresh shower gel."
4,"Scent doesn’t last but when I do smell it, it’s amazing. Just wish it was a longer lasting, but for the value can’t beat it"
4,"The smell isn’t for me, but my little brother loved this as a gift"
4,"The scent is quite subtle, but great value for money."
4,Scent is great. Value for your money
4,Smell awesome
4,"Smells good , decent for the cost"
4,"Smell good but doesn’t last long, no more than 2 hours."
4,It’s 13 bucks for a big bottle of decent and great smelling cologne. If you’re expecting high quality stuff don’t buy it and spend the 100 bucks on the good stuff. Y’all expect too much.
4,Awesome product for the $$
4,"Great smell, last all day"
4,"As far as a no BS review goes, it smells pretty good, very mellow. Doesnt really have all that strong of a vanilla scent, it reminds me a lot of the little vanilla candy sticks that come with packages of Fun Dip. I enjoy it quite a bit, but i wish it was more vanilla and less of the additives."
4,"Spicey smell, doesn't work well for me but my friend like it a lot. Gave it to him and for the amount you get the price is really good!"
4,Good price good scent
4,"Took forever to arrive, but in overall it's a great perfume for the price. Smells great but is not s too manly smell, it's sweet and woody, smells exactly like when you enter a Baskin Robbins ice cream shop, strong vanilla sweet smell and a late touch of wood."
4,"I purchased this because I was tired of going through expensive bottles of cologne just to wear at work or hang around the house, but I also still wanted to smell good. I wanted something cheaper as an every day cologne, saving the more expensive colognes for occasions that were more special.  At about $20 a bottle, this is pretty much what I expected and I’m fine with that. I tried the Vanilla Spice scent and I did like it, but if I’m being honest I thought it smelled a little more feminine than what I anticipated. Don’t get me wrong, it smelled good and could definitely be considered a men’s cologne, but when I ran out I decided to try a different scent from Cremo just to see if I could find something better.  I decided to purchase the Blue Cedar and Cypress scent and it’s got more of a manly scent, but when I asked my girlfriend which scent she thought smelled better, she said “The Vanilla Spice one. I like them both though”. Either way, they both smell pretty good and I don’t think you could go wrong with either.  I get complimented with “You smell good” by strangers from time to time when I’m at work or in line at the grocery store. Initially, both scents have a strong alcohol smell when you first apply it to yourself but after a few minutes, that fades and the true scent takes effect. The scents do fade fairly fast, I would guess they’re strong for the first four hours and fade after that but at the price of the bottle, it isn’t a big deal for me to reapply some more in the middle of the day if I need to. If not, the smell is still there but not near as noticeable.  Overall, I’m happy with my purchases and will order another bottle when I run out, which will be a few months because the bottles last a while even with every day use. I’m considering the Boubon and Oak scent next. I’ve read some of the negative reviews on these products and all I have to say is ultimately you will have to try these out for yourself to decide if you like it or not, but I think this is a good option for those who want a good everyday cologne that’ll help them stand out from a crowd by smelling pleasant without being expensive."
4,"This smells nice enough to get through without me complaining (twss). It doesn't smell like AXE body spray per se, but it is AXE-ish. I can barely smell the lemon and the cedar is a little sharp. If lemon and cypress were more prominent, I would be happier. So my subjective opinion is that I don't like it, which I would place aside if the ladies around me did.Peace."
4,Never heard of this brand and was a bit apprehensive ordering. It smells great and lasts. Very nice product for price point.
4,The smell is really very strong and chemical with extremely strong sweet notes without discernible mint notes. Stays long though
4,"Smelt in on a buddy of mine and was like, “yo where’d you get this?!” I’m in college and get many a compliment from girls and guys. Scent lasts all day and doesn’t become stale. And the price is totally worth it. Only complaint is that when traveling it leaks."
4,I bought this cologne based on a youtube review of the creamo scented line and decided to try the spice & black vanilla. I also read the reviews on here claiming that they got alot of female compliments while wearing it so I decided to ask my fiancee to do a blindfolded sniff test of the product. Her blindfolded description of the product was that it reminded her of a cup of chai tea with a hint of vanilla.......she also added that she could tell it was an inexpensive cologne compared to a Burberry cologne I own with similar notes that has a stronger spice smell. She thought that it was a nice cologne for the value. I've worn this cologne to work several times and I was hoping to receive compliments but as of now I have not heard anything from my co workers or customers. I want to believe that the spice notes might work better in the winter or on a night out than wearing it early in the morning in the middle of summer. Overall I'd like to believe it's a decent purchase and would like to try other fragrances from creamo to rotate during the week.
4,Very nice scent.
4,Amazing for $25!
4,Nice smell and not overwhelming but still catch attention
4,"Smells good, long lasting smell depends on what type of material sprayed on, not too much of a strong over power smell, doesn't stain clothes,considered a good cologne."
4,"I found this colognes after actually using their beard oil and was delightfully surprised to see their Bourbon & Oak cologne. I've been a huge fan of colognes of the warm and spicy variety for over a decade now and decided to try this one as well.I gave it over a year since my purchase and I have to say, this is pretty good stuff! I wear this just about every day almost and I don't get tired of it. Though I will say that I don't think it's VERY bourbon-y, you still get some very subtle hints of it- which I personally prefer over the distillers blend (which though I love bourbon, I don't like to smell like I poured a shot over myself). The scent actually lasts all day for the most part and it's never too strong, just right.Not sure why someone would compare it to AXE or whatever, but this is better than that. Very reminiscent to the higher end colognes I've tried over the years. Definitely worth giving a try for the $20 you pay.I'm about two thirds of the way done with it and thought I'd give the Spice & Black Vanilla one a go, so I just ordered it."
4,"I’ve been using the body wash version of this scent and it’s great. The cologne smells the same, though it does seem like one spritz is plenty, as the scent seems strong. To be fair, nobody has told me that it smells too strong, even when prompted. The scent is woodsy and spicy, so if you like that, I recommend trying this one. Price is fair for the largeish volume"
4,excellent aroma. not long lasting.
4,Woody vanilla. I like it.
4,"Not too bad for that price. I just give it a try coz sometime its good to do it. Kind of different smell , but that doesn’t last for that long. thanks everyone who gave good response to my question before getting it. Appreciated."
4,"Cologne is very personal obviously. Generally however, this is a nice masculine scent.  It's reasonable priced and my female gave it a thumbs up so......."
4,which i find a bit edgy.  definitely a quality fragrance howeveer.  one spray will stay with you 3 days if you don't scrub it off
4,"I first bought this for around 18 dollars or so, i thought “hey why not ill try it”. I purchased the blue cedar one and was not disappointed. My girlfriend loved it, i loved it, and it was certainly worth the money. Now that ive come back to order more i see the price at $32 and I'm hesitant. Im not totally sure if i got this at a discount the first time around, but i cant justify a unnecessary price hike. Other than that, good stuff. But maybe not for the price that it is now. Ill be looking else where until the price is lowered.Scent is not overly powerful, its nice, light, and respectable. However ive noticed that it doesn’t totally stick around that long."
4,"This smells so good, I would give it 5 stars but it doesn’t last long at all."
4,"This is easily became my daily go to scent. It's light in scent and perfect for the summer. My Wife really liked this new scent I purchased, so that's a big plus! Best thing was how cheap this was, this is a good buy!"
4,This cologne is a great smelling cologne that last for hours. And if you wear expect a lot of complements on how good you smell.
4,Bought this sent for my husband I wasn't sure how it would smell but I have to say it is a wonderful sent and it last long just as stated...Loving it on my husband!
4,Smells amazing. Just wish it lasted longer. Not your typical perfumey cologne
4,Decent cologne I like it not a huge compliment getter but a good cologne at a great price you cannot go wrong with
4,"Beautiful scent, smells a lot like spicebomb extreme. Only reason it’s not a 5 cause the longevity. Only lasts a couple hours before you have to re apply. So bottom line good spicebomb clone for a 1/3 of the price with 1/3 of the longevity."
4,Good cologne! Worthy of the price.
4,"This cologne doesn't last long on skin even if you put a lot on. The scent is decent. It's not so expensive, though. Good for the constant sprayer."
4,"Water and birch has a slight feminine tone to it, but I still think it smells amazing. My husband thinks it’s too feminine so he’s been mixing it with another cologne"
4,Great smell; does last a pretty good while. Yet of course there are other fragrances with long scent boosts; eau de parfum and parfum. Still great product
4,"If you want to smell like a cowboy, look no further. It's rich. The smell instantly reminded me of the Stetson cologne I used to wear, which isn't bad. It's not exact, but similar. It's strong. A few squirts will last you all day. Giddy up!"
4,Smells really good
4,One of the better scents. The cedar and cyprus is ok too.
4,A oak wood scent. Scent is for winter. Strong. A couple of Spays will last 4-5 hrs. Manly scent. Not my taste in colognes but not a bad price for what you’re getting.
4,It has a very unique scent.. very attractive
4,I love the smell. I don't have to worry about someone else smelling like my man.....I like that
4,Good value for the price.
4,Very nice.
4,"This cologne is seriously a game changer. After unboxing and testing this out I was shocked at how much value this is. I’ve been overpaying for colognes for years. I paid like $15 for this on Amazon and I would rather have this over several other colognes in my collection that cost 10x the money. It smells like a high quality, mature yet sophisticated scent that’s perfect for casual wear. It smells clean and safe to wear for any occasion.I would highly recommend trying this out.For the price you can’t go wrong!"
4,"Great scent, terrible performance. If it lasted longer it’d be worth multiple buys"
4,Smell really good but not last more then 5 hour
4,my wife all over me :)
4,the scent is really good. usually i am more of a mixer and would find myself using both a men's and a women's scent because alone they just weren't good enough for me. this one though is all i need. it has a great balance but i do wish it would last a bit longer throughout the day.
4,"I bought this for my husband and I like it, smells nice."
4,Smells really good. Strong bourbon smell. Doesn't last very long.
4,"Love this, it starts out a little sweet but wears well through out the day. This scent will last 9+ hours."
4,Great scent just doesn't last for me.
4,Very nice scent. Not to powerful but enough to get noticed 2 sprays will be enough
4,I like the unique sent of this men’s cologne. When I want to wear something different for a special occasion this cologne will work perfectly.
4,"Great smelling product, but does not last very long at all. By lunch, it's long gone."
4,The scent was not very desirable but longevity is acceptable.
4,I like it. Just my opinion.
4,Super strong. I have to spray it on my jeans because it's to strong for the shirt. Overall good backup scent.
4,I bought this for my boyfriend based on the description and had never experienced the scent before. I am pretty happy with it all though it can be a little strong if too much has sprayed. It's a nice backup cologne for sure.
4,smells good. Women can wear it too. Its just not strong enuff for me.
4,Doesn't smell much like Vanilla. Sweet and pleasant.
4,"I love the scent but my boyfriend asked, ""are you sure this is for men""?  I'll try the more manly, musky scent for him next. Love that it's made in the USA!!!"
4,"For 20 bucks this is unbelievable. The overall scent is great and will win over any audience. A little more ""spice"" than I'm used to but I'm fond of it. Only downside is the longevity of the scent; within a couple hours it was gone."
4,"Mine arrived earlier than expected (always a plus). At least one (hilarious) review mentions the ladies being unable to resist. Well, I haven't gotten laid yet, but I like the smell very much. It's a strong smell, so be light on the sprays. I also ordered another fragrance from this company and am more excited to get it. If you're afraid to order scents online - as I was - I recommend taking a chance on this one. The description is pretty spot on, and I doubt you'll be disappointed."
4,"Not bad for a cheap calogne.  It smells pretty good. Im gonna try the other scents,after buying this one."
4,Smells like Spicebomb. Smells more spice than vanilla but overall it's good.
4,Just as good as a high dollar cologne.
4,"After reading all the reviews, was not sure I would like this, however it comes on like Aspen, but then changes into a sweeter scent with hints of  Bourbon & Oak. I do not think it is over powering. I would probably purchase again, but want to try some of the other scents by Cremo. Not Bad at all."
4,"The scent is great, however, the bottle was leaking when I opened it up. It still continues to leak when I spray it."
4,"The smell is good but it won’t last long, same thing with me and my friends, it just won’t last long at all. I won’t be buying this product again"
4,"Decent scent, a little too sweet, and make sure you’re buying the right scent, I meant to get the spicier one, but ended up getting bourbon oak. It’s ok, I’ll use it, but I have to mix it with other stuff to actually get a decent smell.Longevity is intense in the beginning but seems to wear off in about two hours. Great value for money though."
4,Smells great. Product recieved damage-free and on time.
4,Its nice for the price and last for about 4-6 hours on my skin.
4,I use the Silver Water & Birch Body Wash. One of my two favorite scents by them. This spray was sold out on their site so I searched for it and found it here. (Their site actually directs you to other places to find their products if they are out).  It is a very light scent. It seems to stay longer on my neck and body (torso) than my arms. I suggest using it after using the body wash. It is just a really nice clean scent. I have tried 4 of them and I am sticking with this one and the Bourbon & Oak. That spray is nice also.
4,"I have been looking for a decent spicy, not to sweet smelling cologne. This almost hits the mark, it is still a bit on the sweet side, however it has a great spicy smell which gets spicier and less sweet as the days goes on. It lasts a good while. I have and office job and the scent is still on me by the end of the day. I would definitely buy it again.  Less is more with this one 1 or 2 sprays is plenty."
4,Love the scent
4,"I've been using this cologne for 9 months and I'm pretty happy with it.First, the container is an excellent size. I spray it maybe 10 times every week (about 3 days of use each week) and the bottle isn't even half empty after 9 months. That's an incredible value for your money.Second, the smell is actually pretty good. I've gotten compliments on it before (a sign of a good cologne) and it reminds me of a woody + fruit + palm tree scent. The scent is super strong when you first apply it, so be careful how many times you use it. Usually two sprays on my neck and one on my shirt (it doesn't stain) is good for me. The strength wears off after ~20 minutes and then it's just a subtle scent.The smell itself usually lasts a few hours. If you're driving with the car windows down that'll shorten the duration by about an hour but you'll still be able to smell hints of it.It was the first cologne I had ever purchased and overall I think I scored. The value is incredible and it'll last you more than a year. As for scent, I like it but next time I'll try experimenting with something that lasts longer but isn't as strong."
4,Good smell. Not overpowering.
4,Love it
4,The scent is really good but longevity is only like 3 hrs or less on my skin
4,"A nice scent but I prefer Bourbon & Cedar, a more manly scent,"
4,A great budget cologne when you want to smell nice but you aren't looking to impress.  A masculine scent that goes on with a hint of lemony citrus that fades into that nice cedar scent.  Decently long lasting and well worth the buy
4,"This product smells a little fruitier and sweeter than the Bourbon and Oak liquid body wash.  It still smells great, just doesn't smell as masculine as the body wash.  Needs more oak to it."
4,"This is a nice fragrance, I’m a woman I bought it because of the review the guy who said everyone wanted him lol ! I like unisex fragrances because I don’t care for flower or extra sweet colognes, this is really nice, it’s a lil sweet at first especially for a man, but as it wears it has a sexy unisex scent. I like it a lot."
4,"I personally do not like this dominant woody Vanilla smell, too much, not masculine, but, sweet, to cover one's smoking habit, in the library, I can imagine.It smells like Lolita Lempicka Eau De Toilette Spray for Men I already own.  Lempicka is more mature lady-like. but, Cremo vanilla is lighter, as it fades rather fast within 2 hours. I don't know how others would like the smell on me. but, it is not woody or has enough top notes.Top : Kashmiri CardamomMiddle : Cashmere WoodsBase : Vanilla Bourbon (this is basically the smell you will get)It says made USA, on the packaging box,  but, nothing was marked on the bottle. That is very odd. It looked like home-made/home-packaged."
4,It's worth the price easily good clean semi seductive scent.
4,I would definitely recommend this cologne!!!
4,"Terrific smell. One beef is that the nozzle is inconsistent in doling out the spray. Sometimes, it barely emits anything, so you have to keep an eye on it.EDIT: As others have noted, the smell does fade significantly within an hour or so. It's not gone, but a re-application might be necessary. I became sufficiently frustrated by this to knock a star off.But overall, this is a good product and value."
4,Smells just like Spicebomb (extreme to my nose moreso). Shame it's weaker in performance but you get what you pay for . It's a great buy if you'd like to try Spicebomb without the price tag 👍
4,"Smell is great, not too strong, it just doesn't last long."
4,"Although it is a bit more ""woody"" (Burnt Oak"") smelling than I thought, I still like it.  Especially since it is not really overpowering or the primary smell.. just a bit persistent.This cologne lasts a long time which is really quite nice."
4,Nice fresh scent. Shower clean.
4,"Very nice and manly warm scent. Nothing flowery or fancy, but definitely classy."
4,"I was hoping for a little more of a rustic/manly scent. This could be worn by a woman easily. It is nice, but too sweet for my taste.  I ordered another Cremo scent, and like that one, it leaked About 20% of the juice during shipping. The sprayer was loose and I had to transferred into new atomizers."
4,"I think some reviews say that this is a scent women will wear as well.. can confirm.  Cheaper colognes tend to have more of an alcohol smell to them.  I can confirm that here as well, although Cremo products are a good product at a good price- so I thought I would try.  I won't repurchase next time though."
4,"Smells amazing, different than other fragrances on the market."
4,"Smells great, last about normal time for cologne3-4 hours then I can't actively smell it not sure if it goes away or if I get use to the smell either way doesn't stop me from reapplyingBe careful when opening when buying fragrance they shake and shift in transit so expect leakage but that pack pretty well."
4,Smells very good. My husband bought this for himself. I was worried about the scent at first but I really like it!
4,"Purchased Blue Cedar & Cypress cologne by Cremo. It's a great scent, almost what I had imagined it would be w/out ever testing it. Woodsy and maybe a little sweet sums the scent up fairly well.Only give it 4 out of 5 because the bottle was only filled up 80% which is a bit disappointing. Should still last awhile though if you rotate 2 or 3 colognes out and use this one lightly. The scent is strong and seems to linger past 5-6 hours (in a good way). My wife mentioned enjoying the smell of this cologne too. All in all, it's not too shabby."
4,This has a clean scent. It is masculine and spicy with a hint of a rose water undertone. I know that really doesn’t makes sense but trust me it will when you hits you. The best part it? It doesn’t seem to fade and lasts all day. I get many compliments and I’m m a fan of the Cremo bodywash so I said what the hecK?! Give it a try I don’t think you will be disappointed.
4,Very clean fragrance
4,really love the scent!
4,Cologne smells good.  Just used to perform a stronger scent
4,I liked the amount of Liquid Fragrance thisProduct Contained!!!
4,I loved the fragrance of this cologne. It’s a little musky but with the pleasant highlights of summer. As you move about you get a whiff of smelling pleasantly good so you know others are picking up good vibes in this heated weather.
4,My girlfriend says the scent says it has a floral scent. But it doesn't last as long as she would like it in the hot Las Vegas Sun.
4,"This scent is very strong, but I love it! At first all I smelled was the alcohol but the long I had it on, the more I got of the actual scent. I cant really put my finger on what it smells like, the only thing I can describe is that it's a little sweet. I 100% recommend"
4,"The perfume's quality is excellent and the packaging is super cute. It did not cause any irritations.I do not like the scent, however; it isn't bad, just my personal preference."
4,Nice soft scent and cute bottle as well
4,"Works great, straightens hair while drying and easy to comb through hair due to spaced hair bristles. Only dislike is that it’s a larger roller brush which makes it difficult to get to roots… roots still a little damp while rest of hair (section) was dry."
4,"I have VERY fine and flat hair. While this doesn’t give me salon quality volume, nothing else does either. LolI love that I can dry my hair and smooth it out at the same time. Previously I would have to dry and then use a flat iron to smooth out the ends. This gives a nice polished look."
4,I love this product!  Wish it was less expensive but however Amazon has the best price!
4,Excellent!
4,"First off, I rated it 4 stars because the handle is large and even though I don’t have small hands, it’s tough to hold on to. Otherwise, it’s 5 stars!For the price, the best hair tool in my arsenal! I have curly to wavy hair (depending on the weather), and this is great for straightening it. I have a medium length bob, very fine, somewhat thin. This is so much easier to use than a dryer and round brush! The heat is high enough to really straighten my hair for the entire day, and the brush element allows me to add volume where I want it (at the crown).Again, the only real downside is the handle size. It’s tough to hold on to for the time it takes for me to dry my hair, so I’ve started making that the last thing I do, so my hair has some time to air dry. Or, if I’m really in a hurry, I half-dry with my regular dryer, then switch over to this - works just as well."
4,"I got this extra expensive red one because a. I hate the color pink and b. the product image said it had a much smaller diameter (2.8 inches or something like that). But nope—it looks really good, but it is huge. The diameter is the four inch size. It works well though, so I’ll keep it."
4,Easy to use for beginners. Dries too fast. Hair gets very hot even on the low setting. They should place the temperature control knob at a better spot for easier handling. Overall it’s an excellent tool for working  on your hair if you’re a beginner and don’t want to spend a lot going to the salon esp. for the price.
4,I love how it works and how my hair is dried and styled at the same time. The handle is quite large to hold on to and takes some getting used. The temperature runs pretty hot - there is a “cool” but would be nice to have a “warm”
4,This dryer does a good job but is a little heavy and is louder than my regular dryer.
4,"I have rather straight hair.  I don't know how to use things like this, so I will have to practice, but I can already tell you that, by mistake, this thing straightened my hair so completely that I could NOT get the natural waves back in my hair until I washed it!  So, I think it has amazing power, and I just have to learn to use it to ADD curl!"
4,"SO much faster and easier, with much better results, than two-handed brush/blow dryer styling!!!  I was amazed (and thrilled).Two wishes for improvement.  First, and most important, add a low speed with cool setting.  Second, make power cord about 2 feet longer."
4,"Got this to replace another brand, this is a lot more powerful and thus dries quicker. Could benefit from a mid setting since the difference between low and high is major, but all in all, gets the job done fast and leaves hair smooth and soft."
4,"Bought this based on reviews and if definitely saves me time on my thick hair.  Only complaint is that it does leave the top a little flat but maybe I need to use some type of root boost product or change my drying technique.  Either way, would still recommend."
4,"I do like it, but I feel like it gets too hot even on the lower setting. It is easy to use, though."
4,Great product just a little heavy for me right now ( recovering from some surgery)
4,Dries thick hair fast. Great substitute for a salon blowout!
4,"My hair dresser uses this product and loves it.  I have rotator cuff problems with my right arm, so this is a little heavy for me to hold.  It does dry adequately."
4,I don't give 5 stars unless it's  great but the Mrs says it's great so it gets 4. She's happy so I'm happy.
4,The temperature dials are not the easiest to work with. The hot is hot! The cool is barely noticeable. It dries great but make sure you use product to protect your hair.
4,My wife loves it .
4,"Drastically cuts down drying time. Leaves hair smooth and less frizzy. Only use a straight iron for touch ups. Do wish the cool setting was cooler, it’s more like a low warm."
4,"The Revlon dryer brush is a little bulky on the handle and a little heavy, making it a little difficult to grab and stretch the hair from the root, maybe it should have longer wire bristles. However, I am happy with my purchase since it shorten a little the process of drying and flat ironing my hair"
4,"It dries your hair really quickly. It takes me about 38 min to do my hair well. My hair reaches halfway down my back(it's very long) and is thick/wavy. It's relatively easy to use. Since the brush is wide/big, you can dry your hair in bigger sections, which takes less time. It took me a couple of minutes to get used to the brush and once I did I could go faster and get smoother hair (tip: the key to straight/smooth hair is tension). It pulls the hair a little bit, but not terribly, and if you detangle your hair beforehand I think you will be good. It does get really hot though, I usually start out on high but then have to switch to low. The cool setting isn't cool, it's more warm air. So for the three settings, I would describe it as really hot, hot, and warm. Since the cool setting doesn't work, I would suggest twisting your hair into little buns or just putting it up in a ponytail to reduce frizz as your hair cools down. I usually part my hair in two sections and put them up in buns which give me slight waves, which I like."
4,"I have many styling tools- curling irons, a curling rod, a dyson hair dryer, a flat iron, etc and this is by far my best weapon for frizzy hair. It gets my hair so smooth even on the most humid day! I often get my gaur blown out at a blow dry bar once or twice a week but with this new styling tool, I can get salon results at home.Cons: It is bulky so LOUD!!!!!"
4,"Drying power and temperature are fine, but it is heavy. I‘d really like it if somebody else was using it on my hair."
4,"While I like this product, I think it is meant for longer hair.  My hair is chin length and I find the thickness of the device a bit cumbersome."
4,Works good I have long hair too. Just get tangled when trying to do the back of my hair. Overall o loved the results it’s worth the price paid
4,I’m always in a rush to get out the door for work. Wish it dried faster.
4,"I like that it dries my fine hair quickly, it's easy to use but it gets cumbersome after a while due to its weight."
4,I love it but I highly recommend you also use a heat protectant spray before you dry hair. The brush has high heat very close to your scalp and can eventually cause heat damage.
4,I had my doubts … very surprised that it actually works! My hair feels amazing afterwards!
4,So glad I found this on Amazon. I use it daily
4,"Really easy to style your hair with this product! It does have 3 settings for temperature control high, low, cool. However, on the high setting it does seem to get too hot after a few minutes of use."
4,I don’t know give a five star because 1. sometimes it is very hot for my ears and 2. I wish it has a on/off power button so it would be easier to useAnyway I recommend it and it is useful for me
4,Good choice and time saver
4,"It is a good product, well made, dries your hair great.  BUT if you have any shoulder, neck, elbow problems, this might not be the product for you.  I can't dry and style my hair in one pass, I have to take breaks."
4,"Overall I was very pleased with this product, however I have long curly hair and it did take a really long time to straighten it. You have to take pretty small sections and it made my hair a bit frizzy, but I'm not sure if that was the dryers fault or the products that I used. After all is said and done though, it did give my hair some great volume!"
4,"Love what it does for my hair. I have a natural wave, and thick long hair. With this dryer, my hair comes out so smooth. It is lightweight and handles well. I'm not crazy about the loud noise, and the switch to move from low to high. It would be better if it was a toggle. But, I'll put up with both to give up having to hold a heavy dryer and a hairbrush. I actually dry my hair more fully, eliminating the frizzes. I also purchased the smoothing cream, and like using that as well."
4,Great for just shampooed hair.
4,"Handle is a little large for smaller hands, but with practice has gotten better."
4,"I had high hopes for this dryer. I have fairly thick hair and drying is time consuming.  The brush is great, but not as much air flow/power as I need."
4,I just wish the chord was longer!!! It’s so easy to use.
4,It took me a few times to get used to it.  I was actually going to return it.  The barrel is a bit large to hold in my hand and it was loud but I do like it enough to keep it.  It works well to straighten.
4,"I love the way it works, I am really happy with it. I just wish the handle was much smaller."
4,"So I didn’t watch any videos on how to use this item; seemed pretty self explanatory. I did read multiple reviews. Just like most have mentioned your hair needs to be about 90% dry for this to really work. Seems silly to still have to use a regular hair dryer first, but it is what it is. So after using my regular hair dryer, I use the Revlon to finish up. It personally takes me with the Revlon, but I do get a bit of lift and added volume that I don’t get with my regular dryer. That said I will continue to use this brush occasionally when I’m not in a hurry. I have extremely fine hair if that matters."
4,I actually really do like it.  Only 4 stars as it’s kinda large and awkward to handle.  Super fast drying power and decent volume for my fine hair.  It’d be great if it had more options for temperature levels.
4,"I think this is a great product, but it doesn't work well on my coarse, tight and fragile curls. The tiny bristles snagged and pulled a lot of my hair out.  I think this would be ideal for someone with a looser curl pattern.Great drying power, temperature control and easy to use."
4,It is much larger than I expected but that is not a problem at all. You definitely will need practice. It's noisyier than a regular dryer which I don't care for.  It gets pretty hot so dries fast.  There are settings for your preference which is good.
4,"It works great.  No frizz!  There are 2 things I dislike.  1. It is very bulky for my small hands so it's a little difficult to use, but still better than holding a brush and a hair dryer.  2.  I keep burning my finger on the little section between the handle and the brush.  Because of the bulkiness of the handle, in order to get a good grip and not drop it, I seem to move my hand up closer to the brush.  Eventually I'll learn to control it better.  It will take a while because I seldom use a dryer from late spring to mid fall.  It's just too hot to use a dryer during that time period."
4,Love this. Cuts down the amount of time I need to do my hair.
4,"I like that it serves multiple purposes (dryer + brush) but for me it does not help much with straightening. I have long, wavy/curly hair so this doesn't create for a polished, smooth look for me. I think it's better suited for people who already have mostly straight hair and just want to style and go. My hair remains frizzy and wavy, and still requires a straightener to get a smooth or straight look"
4,"The hot setting gets extremely hot, almost burns my hand. Otherwise great product for people like me who can’t use a round brush."
4,"This concept was a game changer for me! In the past, I purchased the same styling tools and products as my stylist. But I could never achieve the same results. It was so frustrating. I had been eyeballing this for awhile and finally purchased it on a whim. I’ve used it after every wash along with a quality heat protectant for the past 2-3 weeks and I swear by this. (I also purchased hair styling clips like the salons use which were super helpful.) However, I plan to upgrade to the DryBar brand soon for better quality and less damage to my hair.Long story, short:Hair Type: Thick hair is medium strands. Typically frizzy, wavy/curly, puffy, difficulty staying straightPros:-Product does what it advertises-Works great on thick, curly/wavy hair-Light weightCons:-Gets too hot & low isn’t hot enough-Annoying high pitched sound when set to “high”-Plasticy smell"
4,"I have really thick, prone to frizz, curly hair. If I wait till my hair is damp (not soaking wet) then it’s a quick blowout. It’s lightweight but loud, the brush section itself gets reeeeaaally hot so be careful! I dropped it and grabbed the hottest part by accident and burned myself.Make sure you use a thermal protector for your hair, it def gets very very hot."
4,I love this brush dryer. It’s great for smooth hair and touch ups if blowouts. My only complaint is that the handle has a wide diameter. It is hard to hold at times compared to a round brush and separate dryer. It is HOT and the cool works but not as cool as I would like to smooth the hair cuticle and set the style.
4,"This drier saves me a little bit of time. I have thick  shoulder length hair and it takes about 13 minutes to dry with this drier. The only thing I don't like about it is that it is loud on high. It can get really warm on the hair, but if you move it around and not stay too long in one spot it is okay."
4,"I love Revlon’s One Step Hair Dryer and Volumnizer. It’s easy to use and I no longer need a separate brush when drying my hair. However, for the past couple of months, the nondetachable round Bristol heads keep falling off my Revlon’s hairbrush. As a result, using the tool hurts my scalp."
4,I really love this hair dryer got it for christmas i use it once a week now out of nowhere it stopped working
4,It works good so far but the handle gets hot that I have to take breaks while dryer my hair
4,It works great for me. I have really frizzy hair with some waves. My hair looked so smooth and shiny. I didn’t have to use my straightener. I love it aside from it coming with a few bristles bent.
4,"I love that this adds volume to my long layers!  I still have to use my hair dryer to get my hair about 80% dry, otherwise it would take way too long to dry my hair. I get a lot more volume from this product than I ever did with a straightener."
4,"Wife was very pleased with how well this styled her hair. Initially looks oversized and clunky, but she says not. Price of $37 was well worth it. Scammers charging $30 for no-name knock-offs."
4,"I wish it had a temperature setting… And if it does I don’t know how to work it, but it is very hot all of the time. But other than that I love it!"
4,"Great item, however, you can’t turn it on/off with one hand."
4,"This hairdryer is pretty easy to use. Even though, I expected more! My hairs gets frizzy when i wash it, so I expected to control it more with this. But I liked it, it’s ok."
4,Feels like it takes a long time to dry even short hair.
4,"love this product, acts as a blow dryer and brush at the same time"
4,I only gave this a 4 because it's REALLY loud.  But other than that it works great--sooooo much better than blow drying.  Super easy to make it look like I just had a professional blow out.  Would def recommend.
4,This hair dryer smoothes my hair as it dries it unlike a basic hair dryer that makes my hair more frizzy. This dryer also helps with straightening my hair during the drying process. The only reason I didn’t give it 5 stars is because it does take a little longer than a basic dryer to dry the hair and it’s a little difficult to use on short hair
4,"I have curly hair and some of the reviews led me to think this might straighten my hair in a way that other tools have failed to do. Inevitability, my hair still looks frizzy even when straightened. It never actually looks like someone with straight hair. I will say that this works faster than a straightener in the sense that it is hot enough and blows enough that I can do it in bigger chunks. So that is something. But really it still looks like someone who has curly hair who has straightened her hair. Even if I use some sort of product that is intended to help make curly hair look straighter. It is a perfectly fine thing for an okay blowout but not a miracle worker as some reviews claim."
4,"I love this Revlon hair brush because it simplifies the drying process of blow dryer and brush into 1. The only thing I don’t like is that it has a weird screeching noise. Besides that, it does the job and I love using it to speed up blow drying my hair"
4,"When I ordered it I didn’t realize how big it is. I am growing my hair, but it isn’t long enough yet to use this hot air brush. Hoping to use it more as my hair gets longer."
4,"Great alternative to drying and styling hair and hair dries very fast.  However, my dryer is very loud compared to another brand I owned.  Not sure if this is a defect in my dryer, or whether all Revlon One-Step hair dryers are this loud.  Other than the loud noise, I would highly recommend it."
4,I bought my first one in January 2019. At that time they offered a product protection plan. I guess that was discontinued since the product breaks down so easily. But it transforms my firizzy hair so I'm willing to purchase another one. It helps that the cost has dropped over the years too. My husband says I needed to do a better job of keeping the vents lint free. I'll try that this time.
4,This product is good but it takes time to dry hair like you’ve to do 5-6 rounds and when on high it’s so loud. If you’re patient enough to cover entire hair then you’ll like this product.
4,"This thing definitely works! I have long curly hair that I usually dry and straighten. This doesn’t save time, but definitely gives my hair more body than when I straighten. The only downside, which to me is a big one, it is so loud! I would have paid more money for a quieter one."
4,I really like that this drys and straightens at the same time. Much easier that dryer and round brush!It does get very hot on High so I use on low heat and it works well for my fine hair.  So far it is working well for me.
4,Need to go on and on for a while to get good result but it works well. Looks Very original.
4,"It's easy to use (for strightened hair). I didn't yet figure out the curlying/volume aspect this product gives. But I used it just once, so there is time and hope. So far I can say that, it leaves your hair silky smooth after use."
4,This does a great job but is pretty bulky and awkward to use with one arm especially  in the back.
4,"I have super thin, fine hair, so this gets the job done fast.  My only complaint is, it gets too hot - on low.  Definitely use a heat-protectant on your hair before using this dryer!"
4,I use it every day and it is great. Personal I would  like the small diameter brush. Didn’t check that.
4,I like it
4,"A bit loud and hard to manage if you don’t know how to maneuver it, but the end result is amazing!!"
4,Like the dryer brush but wish the barrel was smaller. My shoulder length hair is layered so the thickness of the barrel doesn't work well with my shorter layers. My hair is fine but I have a lot of it and it dries it quickly which is great. Would love if I could dial in the temperature instead of just hot or cool. It'd be nice to be able to set it to warm. I also like that where the controls are so I don't accidentally turn it off while drying/styling my hair and the venting is in a good place too so it doesn't overheat like another one I had did when I held it.
4,"Works Great, but  is very heavy to hold.  If you have super thick hair, it will take a while to dry and your arm will get very tired, very quickly.Overall, it does a really good job."
4,Dryers my shoulder length hair in 1O minutes. Takes a few times to get used to not having a brush and traditional blow dryer. It’s heavier than I thought. The end result is great!
4,I like the product but the brush is too big.  But still the product is good.
4,"I like this brush dryer....  If it was lighter and more compact, it would make travel easier.  Prices seems to be coming down significantly since I bought it, too.  It really works great though."
4,I love the product! It dries the hair pretty fast and styles it even without any products. It 100% better solution than styling with blow dryer and a brush The only thing that worries me is how harmful it is for the hair cause the brush gets pretty hot.I’ve been trying to use it once a week when I really need my hair look pretty and I feel amazing when my hair is done .A minor flaw is that writings on a handle wore out pretty fast
4,"I found this one step dryer/styler very easy to use and definitely a time saver.  Hair comes out styled much like a salon comb out with very little effort.Compliments were forthcoming from many people I came across, making me wonder if I do not usually present well groomed.  That aside I highly recommend this tool.  The price is so reasonable and actually delivers on its promise; I have paid three times the price for other tools that guaranteed ease of use and amazing style without either being realized.Though I've enjoyed the results, I would like to see it sized smaller around as my preference would be a tighter curl with more lift.  However, don't pass this one up for your hair arsenal!"
4,When I first received this I thought the brush was too big and would be too difficult to use. I was pleasantly surprised to realize it works very well for styling and dries my thick hair much faster than a regular hair dryer. I would recommend this product.
4,Very easy to use. Comfortable to hold.The only thing I wish was a little better was the “cool” setting. It still feels quite warm. I wish it was just a pushed air setting.
4,It does a great job but it larger and heavier than I expected.
4,Love this tool -- its perfect and creates a professional blow out look in half the time!  The only grip is it get super hot.
4,this great brush blow dryer really solved my problem of trying to dry my hair and use a round brush.
4,I am so glad I got this during prime days 😃I have curly hair and having to blow dry and then straighten can be a huge task. This product does both! Down side...it's loud and it gets hot!
4,This product works just as advertised  the used. Much easier for me to dry and style with this one tool than to reposition a brush multiple times. Love it!
4,It works really well. If you have medium length hair then it would work the best for you! However if you have long hair it’s going to be a struggle. Make sure to clean it throughly of the hairs stuck in the bristles.
4,"This does a good job of drying your hair and seems to do the job in less time than using a separate dryer & brush. The barrel is very big, you don't realize how big till you actually see it for yourself, the pictures can be deceiving. I don't recommend this if you have really short hair. It took me a minute to find where the heck the power buttons were. That and the huge size were the only reasons I deducted a star."
4,I like it works perfectly save a lot of time doing my hair !
4,"Good product, but since it has not temperature control it can sometimes smell like burnt when a hair gets stuck. Overall easy to use."
4,Had this about a week and love it so far! Super easy to use one handed
4,"Thus product does dry with less frizz and it is easy to use. I have fine hair and the instructions say to use the lower heat setting for hair like mine. My only complaint is that it does dry slower than my traditional blow dryer, but I don't feel like my head is getting fried so that's a trade off that I'm willing to make. Definitely the best brush blow dryer on the market."
4,This is great. It has a decent amount of drying power compared to others I’ve tried and I love the color. The only thing I don’t like is how heavy it is. It’s kind of hard to dry your whole head without your arm feeling like it’s gonna fall off.
4,"Amazing results from this hair styler. I recommend using it when your hair is 80% dry otherwise it will take forever to finish your hair. It gives me the look of a salon blowout at home which I LOVE. However, this product really needs to be replaced at least once a year. The bristles get warped and you can see the quality decline after about 6 months or so. Just bought my second one since I’m fine with spending 50 dollars per year on a hair tool. I’m sure more expensive brands would last longer."
4,I purchased based on some great reviews.  It’s a handy tool to have when you are in a rush!  It’s quicker than a hairdryer however I don’t feel it smooths as well especially at the root where you need the stretch especially if you are straightening curly hair which I do.  It does give great volume which I like and easier to achieve than a hairdryer in that respect.  The one thing that really annoys me is how extremely loud it is! It has a piercing sound which I find irritating!  I had to use ear plugs to muffle the sound!! Not sure I read that in the reviews!
4,"I do love this product. It makes my naturally curly (read: frizzy) hair sleek and beautifully straight with nice natural movement. I have medium thickness hair that is about 2 inches above my shoulders. All that being said, mine has worn out VERY quickly in my opinion. In about 6 months’ time the plastic bristles are completely flattened or have fallen out. I take care of this product. It sits by itself on a flat surface when not in use. I use it about twice a week for a big blow dry, which takes about 10 minutes. I also use it daily in the mornings for 1-2 minutes to freshen my hair. I don’t consider that a ton of use, yet I will need to buy another as this one is pretty much worn slap out. So, I’m not impressed with the durability of it at all, but love it otherwise."
4,"This dryer/styler works great!  It’s super easy and I use it often.  My only complaint is the temp is quite hot, even on low."
4,"I really love this product. The upside: adds body and great shine. Downside very loud on high, very high temp even on low. Due to the high temp only use as a styling tool after your hair is barely damp."
4,Really good just be careful to put a heat protective on your hair before you start blow job your hair before you start blow drying it does get hot. This is better if you have a longer hair short hair the barrel is too big.
4,Easy to use love how I can grab the end without burning my fingers
4,"Takes a little longer to dry my hair, but overall does a good job."
4,"Easy to use and fast at drying, but beware: this gets hot! (And I don't feel like the ""cool"" setting really does much.) If you have thin/brittle hair, I would think twice before ordering this product for that reason alone.I found that the soft bristles (which are meant to put tension on the hair) compressed/lost shape pretty quickly which was rather disappointing, but it's still a much better alternative then a separate brush and blow dryer!"
4,Easy to use. Gets very hot.
4,I really like how it lightly curls my hair. The  drying is the only downfall for me. It seems to take longer to dry my hair especially in the back what's thicker. I'm considering getting out my blow dryer to dry it halfway and then using this to style it the rest of the way. What I like about this product is that I would not normally take the time to do my hair. Since I can blow dry it and put a little bit of a flip into it at the same time it was worth the money. It is loud though.... especially on High and larger then I expected the handle to be with my smaller hands.
4,Love this dryer. Only complaint is that the barrel is a little too big for shorter hair. I wish they had different size attachments. Use daily and has held up well.
4,"First I’ll start by saying I’ve been a professional hair stylist for 8 years. I’ve always hated using a blow dryer and brush on myself. I have very thick hair and I just can’t get the grip I’d like on the back of my head in order to smooth my hair. I was skeptical about this because well, it’s Revlon and I’m a professional idk. Run, don’t walk to get this. I dried my hair in half the time and was able to get it exactly the way I like it. For the reviews saying it burnt their hair, they’re using this wrong. Yes, it’s hot. And there is potential to burn your hair like any other hot tool. But you HAVE to keep moving with this. This is not something you wrap and hold like a curling iron. Keep moving, keep brushing, never hold it still with your hair in it. Use a good heat protectant. I took one star off because I do with you were able to customize the temperature, not just the air speed. But if you know what you’re doing you’re golden and will love this. Don’t tell my clients about it (;"
4,Works well but it’s very loud.
4,This dryer is just what I was looking for. I just wish it had a medium heat setting.
4,"Like the drying power and it is lightweight and easy to use.  However,  the temperature control need improvement"
4,Like the product. Would buy again and the product description was correct.
4,"I love this product! It worked really well and I suggested it to a lot of people.However, I bought it in February. Probably used it approximately 20 times, and the heating element has now gone out. Very upsetting. -_- I now must buy a new one, but will likely look for one in a different brand."
4,"Little large, but it works nicely and I would recommend it."
4,The dryer is a little larger than I anticipated and would probably work better for someone with longer thicker hair.  But it doesn’t get overly hot and overall I am pleased with the results.
4,Great drying power!Works great. Dries my hair in half the time vs. regular hair dryer.
4,Easy to use if hair is lightly wet
4,"I didn’t realize it was as large an item as it is.  However, it does what I need really well and, thought bulky, is relatively easy to use."
4,"I don't know if the one I previously owned was a different generation, but it used to leave my hair feeling full of volume. This one does a great job of straitening and taming my hair but without the same level of volume which is a bit disappointing. Overall though I really like it."
4,Almost perfect! A bit difficult to hold as it is pretty big but overall I really like it and would definitely recommend!
4,"Its a nice dryer but I find myself picking my old one over this one especially if I am in a hurry. It takes a while to dry and I have short fine hair. For instance, my old dryer it takes less than five minutes to dry it albeit the setting is pretty hot at high so I use the ""warm"" on my Revlon dryer. With this new one it takes close to 10 minutes and the brush used for the dryer is kind of clunky to use because its rather large. So instead of being able to flip my hair under with just a regular brush and the old dryer. This one is too big to let me roll it under...so it just flips up. A curling iron takes care of the problem. Being this had some great reviews and high scores I was expecting something better than my 7 yr old dryer.A positive is that the heat setting isnt so hot it fries your hair and my hair does have the feel of having a nice professional blowout and it leaves it in good condition. A couple of things I would suggest:1) Have more heat settings that just hot, warm and cool. The warm setting drops the rpms on the motor.2) There has to be a motor that doesnt sound like you are inside a turbine engine. The high pitch it puts out makes it difficult to use due to my tinnitus.3) It would be nice to have an assortment of brushes to use with the dryer for different hair styles and types of hair.Overall, its not horrible but not quite sure how its a top seller...(thats kind of a stupid thing to say because I bought it based on its reviews lol)"
4,Love the way it works
4,This is a game changer for blowing drying your hair in minimum time with best results! This was suggested to me over the years by my hair dresser and two friends. I kept thinking I don’t need another blow dryer or another “thing” taking up storage space in my bathroom. Do not listen to that inner voice! This is the next best thing to having your hair dresser blowing drying your hair - which always comes out perfect and I can never duplicate at home. Two cons but not deal breakers. I don’t feel much of a temperature difference between low- med- high. No biggie. #2 I think it’s kinda noisy especially when I’m drying my hair closest to my ears. Again no biggie. Just get it! Thank me later.
4,"I really like this hair dryer brush ,  I've been using it to get that nice blowout look everyone wants and it's definitely been working . I do have some cons to share though .. i wish it had some sort better temperature control , over a few minutes the dryer becomes really hot and can be damaging to your hair. Another thing i noticed was the brush buildup , there were no instructions on how to clean it. I've been wiping it down with a disinfectant wipe and cleaning the hairs our but i wish there were some instructions or recommendations on how to clean it."
4,Love it but it is heavy
4,Easy to use but it gets very hot!
4,It is a great hair dryer but it was much bigger around than I thought it would be so I returned it. Would be great for longer hair.
4,"Its super easy to use. I have a ton of hair down my back and it's really hard to keep it maintained. I was skeptical because I didn't know how it would be with my long hair, but I love it. The only reason I have it a 4 is because it doesn't dry faster. But my hair isn't near as poofed when im done."
4,"Dries super quick and easy to handle. I just wish the barrel was a bit smaller, but GREAT for smoothing out my hair!!"
4,I’ve been eyeing tools like these for months and finally found a price I was happy with. It gets the job done!
4,Need to be careful using the high heat my hair has been extremely dried especially towards tip of my hair and noticed it’s the Revlon Brush.
4,"I love and hate this tool.  Let’s get the bad part out of the way first: it’s LOUD. I mean incredibly loud, louder than a regular hair dryer, a leaf blower or a vacuum cleaner. I can only use it while wearing foam ear plugs. But if you can get past the noise level, it’s a genius tool.  I have really long, thick, fine hair that loves to hold on to water. It usually takes 50 min to dry my hair with a traditional blow dryer and round brush. With this tool, I’m done in 15 min flat and don’t need to flat iron after.  After towel drying my hair and adding a heat resistant product, I section my hair and comb through to reduce tangles.  Then I work section by section, back to front, alternating sides.  It’s incredibly easy to use, my hair never tangles and I can add volume to the top by drying the top center sections pulling forward. Absolutely fantastic if you can get over the noise."
4,"Easy to use and works really well to dry/style fast. Only has high, low, and cool settings and can get very hot while on high. Difficult to get your roots, but still shortens blow drying time by a lot."
4,"Very easy to use to achieve a simple style.  However I notice my hair is breaking and this is the only thing new in my routine.  I'm using ""low"" and ""cool"" now to try to avoid the heat, but it takes longer, or I let my hair  almost dry naturally and just use this for body and curl at the end.  I would buy it again and recommend it to friends."
4,I like this product except that I cannot control the temperature. It's either hot or cool and the hot is very hot. Otherwise it is easy to use and works great on my thick hair and saves time with styling.
4,"I was surprised by the weight. It was advertised as light weight, that is not what I found. The tool works very well and my fine hair is dry in about 5 minutes."
4,Haven’t had it long enough to know it’ll last but really easy way to blow dry hair. Mine goes almost to my bum so it’s pretty long but it provided a nice blowout without getting too warm
4,"This is my second one. The first brush is 2 years old, till works perfectly, but has list almost all the little plastic cups on the individual hair's ends. I felt like it was breaking my hair, hence bought a new one. It dries and straightens he hair well. I only wish it came with a temperature control. The air gets very hot, but you can only regulate the flow, not the temperature."
4,"I love using this when I went to quickly dry my hair, and make sure it's smooth. It's super easy to use with my naturally straight hair.My only complaint is that is get VERYYYY hot when using it, and it makes a very annoying high pitched sound. I always ALWAYS use heat protectant when I use this dryer, and use another brush to help me instead of using my hands because it makes my hair SOOOO hot. I do not use this on a super regular basis, most when I'm in a pinch."
4,"I bought this because the reviews were great. It did awesome drying but once I walked out the door, the weather warped my hair shape. Debating if I should return or not."
4,"Love this product! But it lost its ability to heat up randomly after 2 months of use, was not dropped or damaged in any way, just stopped getting hot one day."
4,It’s a little hard to use and heavy but I’m sure with practice it’ll work great. It gets VERY hot so be careful!
4,I was surprised at how quick it dries. I like that you can brush and dry in one step. It allows you to dry bigger sections of hair. I have thin ethnic curly hair. If your hair is straight it will be a breeze. I have 3c hair/ high porosity hair for reference.
4,"For what it is it’s a really nice tool. The wire swivels so you don’t get tangled on it, it dries and straightens your hair really nicely and makes it super smooth and silky! The only thing that’s a con is the temperature controls. It has high heat on full blast or cool on full blast or low. It would be great if there was a medium temperature as it gets REALLY hot. I have delicate hair so because of how hot it gets I tend to go from the hot to cool setting when it seems too hot, which is kind of tedious. It is pretty easy to use otherwise. The big brush allows you to get a lot of hair and it dries the hair quickly while drying also. Does not do curls but ads a bevel to your ends if you have longer hair. I also can’t seem to use it in a way to give more body/volume to my hair. For the most part it’s like a less damaging flat iron and makes my hair pretty flat. I say it’s easily an 8/10. If it had a medium heat setting would definitely be a 10/10"
4,Blow dries my hair beautifully.  I have long straight fine hair but a lot of it.  Takes a long time to dry naturally.  Leaves hair smooth and shiny.  Barrel is a little too large to produce any curl but I don't use any product either so this may be a factor.
4,Dries hair fairly quick and reduce frizz.No issues with product but I wished it had bore brush bristles I feel like that would hlmake hair stay smooth longer
4,"I've been wanting to try one of these for awhile and jumped on the Prime Day Deal for it. I think it is worth the discounted price, but probably would've been upset if I paid full price. I just used it on my waist length thick hair after getting out of the shower and towel drying pretty good. I used a detangler comb, I did NOT horizontal section my hair this time but probably will from here on out. I travel for work and will sometimes only have a short amount of time between projects to go to my room and shower and on those days I don't wash my hair, so I tested it out like I would use it if I'm away for work and only had 15-20 min. to do hair. I just started brushing it through my hair, I was able to achieve a pretty close look as to when I straighten it, so that's good. Because it's not a blow dryer that air just goes every which way so be careful around face and ears. I still have some damp spots on my roots but I would feel ok to leave my house/hotel room and it didn't take all that long after I got the hang of it. I was curious if the handle would get hot because it was working so hard (its loud) but it was fine. The brush part got hot but the little grip at the end that helps you roll it was still cool to the touch. I like the bristles that help with frizz, my hair frizzes so bad and this helped smooth it. I think this would work even better on shorter hair and am looking forward to using it on my mother when she comes over for me to do her hair. My biggest complaints are that it is HUGE and kind of heavy, I wish the controls were easier to flip through (its hard to twist the knob to the settings and especially hard to go from High to Cool while keeping it in position which would make for better style setting) and it smells a little burny. I hope that goes away because I was half afraid it would ignite while wrapped in my hair. As of right now, I'm assuming that smell is because this is the first time it's used and its burning off any particles from production. If it doesn't go away I'll try to update here."
4,"Just got delivered and put it to test. And it lives up the hype. It did not completely dry my hair but will try again and see if it changes. It is easy to handle with brush, so no tangles and perfectly straight hair in return."
4,My go to when I don’t want to use my straightener. I love how it makes my hair look shiny! Very easy to use. The only issue I have is how loud it is.
4,"I have wavy/ curly hair and getting my hair blow dried without having a frizzy mess after is really hard. This works wonders to damp hair and it feels super healthy after using. I would say that it does still have some heat damage and I would recommend using a heat protectant, but it is way better than blowdrying and then straitening or curling after. It is a more flattened look than ""Blow out"" so be prepared to have pretty straight/ flat hair. I know, however, it does not work on super curly/kinky hair. So if you are on the market for that, this might not work for you. It could offer a healthier way of blow drying, but it would require heat use after the fact. Overall super impressed and I enjoy the product!"
4,I like this dryer brush a lot but the only hard part is the top of the head.  I have to separate it out to get it dry.
4,"The hair drying brush dries and styles at the same time.  The handle fat for my small hands and gets a little heavy.  For long hair, the brush size is just right.  If your hair is short, the brush is too big.  Over all, I like the brush hair dryer over a blow drier."
4,It is a good product only if it is used a lot and constantly the sticks through which the hair passes are damaged but if it works well
4,"I’ve been using this product exclusively for almost 2 months.  At first it didn’t strip the crazy amount of oil I can produce. It seemed to dry out my hair, now it seems healthy but not as hydrated as I need it for curly hair."
4,The scent doesn’t stay on my hair.  The conditioner doesn’t flow even when I shake the bottle.  I had to find a stick to enable me to get the conditioner.  Looks like this has been stored for a long time.  The first order months ago was fine but the ones (2) I got this time must be expired/old.
4,I like both
4,"I really like the shampoo and conditioner.  However, the conditioner bottle is so hard to squeeze with one hand while trying to get the product out of the bottle.  The plastic bottle is sturdy, but a little too sturdy for my arthritic hands to easily use.  As I mentioned, I love the shampoo and the conditioner!"
4,"I like that It doesn't make my hair feel heavy, weighted down. It makes my hair light, soft and smells good."
4,Came with nice packaging. Made my hair soft and retained moisture after wash. Overall liked the shampoo.
4,Product is great. I didn’t like being charged 3 times for the one item though.
4,It's ok
4,My Hair feels and smells amazing
4,I love it!
4,Love this pair! The smell of the shampoo is a little different but that’s the only down side so far. My hair looks and feels great and I am not losing as many strands anymore!
4,Didn’t really do much for my hair or scalp that a normal shampoo wouldn’t do but smelled nice
4,This product could be great maybe for someone else ! My hair simply didn’t like it ! I have short but thick curly normal hair !  I had to give it away
4,Nice packing  bit on pricey side but we see if works well
4,I like this shampoo but I have not seen a difference in my hair's strength. It does give my hair more body
4,My only complaint is the screw cap. Wish it was a pump or a pop open cap. Almost lost the bottle in the shower trying to screw on cap at same time not have shampoo drip down hand
4,"I have a decently dry scalp (ew I know) and was told that this would potentially help with moisturizing my hair because it's friggin apple cider vinegar which helps with nearly everything ever.. but after a few uses, my dandruff was much worse and my head had never itched so much.  I know it's not advertised to help with that directly but it IS supposed to moisturize... and my scalp did the opposite of that. Its smell is much better than I expected being an ACV base and the conditioner is fantastic; however the shampoo kinda messed me up a little. My sister-in-law swears this stuff and she said she'd buy the shampoo from me so that's nice. Thanks girl."
4,I was dissapointed with the lack of scent in the shampoo.  The scent in the conditioner was very good.
4,Amazing
4,"Fragrance wonderful,  ,  wish it dispensed easier.  Appeeling (Apple peel appeal)"
4,The smell is great . Love how soft my hair feels afterwords …
4,"So far I have used both the shampoo and conditioner 2x since it arrived. I do not smell a scent at all in either, but for me,  I like that.  The moisturizer in the conditioner is amazing and using them both together has made my hair very soft."
4,This set of shampoo and conditioner did ok. It was anything above and beyond anything else. Just ok
4,"I love it, it has helped me so much with my dandruff and I my hair is supper soft."
4,I have super sensitive skin and was desperate for something that didn’t upset my scalp and back. The shampoo was no good- WHY DO PEOPLE INSIST ON PUTTING STINGING NETTLE IN SHAMPOOS?? But I liked the conditioner.
4,"I have been slowly transitioning to more hollsitic natural products. For many reasons the haircare and lotions category has been the hardest. Everything is shoved full of silicones, parabens, dyes, etc.After tons of research on every brand known to man I settled on giving this brand a try.The first time I used it I could not believe the amount of buildup that came off of my hair! It was amazing. Ove the next two weeks I continued to use the shampoo at every shower and the conditioner at every other. My hair has never looked so good.The only con to this brand is that the bottles are plastic and not as earth friendly as I would like."
4,I like that I am not losing as much hair as I was before but my hair didn't seem to be as soft and silky as I was hoping it would be.
4,I love this shampoo & conditioner! My naturally curly hair has never looked or felt healthier! I hate their unnecessary plastic packaging. The bottles come wrapped in plastic. The tops come with a plastic insert (totally get this) with a plastic cap on top that you have to take off and replace with the gold caps that come nestled inside yet another plastic cap. Enough with all the caps! Just put the gold caps on the bottles to begin with and call it a day!
4,very good
4,"I don't love not hate the smell of my hair after using this shampoo and conditioner, ive used it 2 times so far and my hair does feel softer and I did notice that my drain didn't clog with hair like it normally does so that's a good sign right!? And also I recently had my hair colored and non of it washed put with the shampoo. You definitely need to use it more than one time before you make your mind up about it."
4,"I have combination oily scalp and dandruff. The shampoo works great for those issues, however, the conditioner isn't very moisturizing."
4,"I really like the scent of these products.  I think they really are great on my hair also.  Only drawback is that the conditioner seems to leave a slight residue.  I feel like I can't get it entirely rinsed. But then it's fine after I get towel dried and combed out, so it might just be me.  Overall I would recommend this product."
4,I really like the way it makes my hair feel
4,It s good for the price
4,"So far, I really like the Apple cider vinegar shampoo and conditioner set. I’ve been using it for several weeks now and plan to order more. It has a nice scent, and I’ve noticed that my hair has been softer, less oily, and no flakes/dandruff.  I’m not really sure if it is helping with hair thickness, but overall, my hair feels healthier."
4,My hair has improved from the damage that was there. this Is great for repairing damage and makes my hair super soft.  I have not had to use the conditioner every day like before so I would say that is a success.
4,Hard to tell exactly yet how good it's going to work on my hair but so far I do like the product... My hair seem softer and I hope it does grow quicker in Normal that will take time for me to tell for sure... But again I like the product very much!
4,"Nice shampoo . I have a sensitive scalp and this shampoo I have no problem with .  As far as hair growth , maybe I’ll notice down the line but I’m assuming with a healthy scalp , better hair . And my hair looks really shiny afterwords."
4,So my hair was a lot curlier after the wash. Hair felt moisturized and softer. I had a lot a product build up and my scalp was killing me. After the wash I was relieved.The smell isn’t terrible. I personally don’t like apples but if you do you’ll love the scent. You only have the smell a couple hours later then it’s just neutral so I don’t mind.
4,"I really enjoy this shampoo and conditioner. I just have one complaint. I don’t have oily hair at all, but for some reason this shampoo and conditioner makes my hair so oily! Even after I have just washed my hair it feels a little oily and then the next day it’s so oily I have to use dry shampoo. It’s nothing a little dry shampoo can’t fix, but if you already have oily hair please be aware of this."
4,"The scents are lovely and soft. However, when my hair is wet it feels rough lacking moisture. It becomes soft when it’s dry but not silky."
4,Loved the way it made my hair feel after one wash.  Added conditioner and WOW!  Hair is grateful.
4,This shampoo is great!
4,I've only used it a couple times but so far we like it
4,Love shampoo
4,I like the way it makes my hair feel
4,I enjoy using this product. It cleans and moisturizes well and helps heal beginning stages of psoriasis. Good treatment for my dry scalp and a excellent recommendation by a nurse. 5 Star rating
4,I was looking for a premium salon quality product and purchased this.  It is very good.  I allowed the conditioner to stay on the recommended time and it really made my hair soft and shiny.
4,Leaves hair smooth and enhance growth.
4,Love the feel of the shampoo & conditioner. My scalp still itches but probably less than with other shampoos.
4,Love the scent. Moisturize it very well leaving your hair feeling soft and smooth. I have a very oily scalp but my ends are normally dry. I shampoo 2 times before applying the conditioner. Detangle your hair beforehand then shampoo. Make sure you're working on your scalp to get the best of it.. I wouldn't focus on your hair entirely but your scalp let it sit for 5 minutes.  Rinse it and apply a generous amount of conditioner but not on your scalp but to your hair. Detangle your hair gently with a comb while leaving the conditioner on wait for 2 to 3 minutes then rinse. You will love your results.
4,"I have wanted to try ""WOW"" for a while. I finally bought it and love it. The smell is amazing and last for days. Makes your hair super soft and helps with dandruff. The condition feels amazing as well but because it is oiled based you have to traid off with other conditioners or else your hair is oily"
4,The only reason  form less than 5 stars is that because they are sold as a set you are left having to purchase both when you run out of the conditioner.  The products are excellent.
4,So far we are liking this
4,Love it!The conditioner smells yummy.
4,"I'm 2 weeks into using this product and so far, so good.  My hair feels like it is a bit more coarse, which is good since it is usually fine and fly away.  Also, it feels like it has more volume and is much easier to style.  I'd like to say that I've noticed a decrease in my hair falling out but I'm not there yet.  The price for both shampoo and conditioner is a bit high but a little goes a long way and I'm worth it.  (smile)"
4,I used twice a week and  it works great on my grease hair.
4,"I love the product so far, however, the gold caps they send with the bottles suck to open in the shower. I use my teeth most of the time to open the bottles."
4,"Just started to use the product. Smells good, my hair is soft."
4,I love it
4,I like how it made my hair feel healthy and softer
4,I gave overall 4 stars for one reason only(although very important to me). I love this product but despise the cap! Please put a flip top on these large bottles. A screw cap with a large amount of product dumping out in the shower with wet hands is inexcusable to me. You’re advertising is gone in my very busy shower because I put your product in different bottles with flip top lids.
4,I bought this for my mom and the sent was good. It has helped my mom with her hair lose and kept her hair soft.
4,"Have only used once now, but notified a big different in the softness and shine of hair. Love is so far"
4,I enjoy this product.  It makes my hair so soft and manageable. Will buy again.
4,"My scalp is a mess. I get sores, dandruff, and it gets super itchy. The only shampoo that somewhat helped is Neutrogena T Gel, but it’s not the best to use long term and it’s smelly. I’ve tried other, natural, shampoos aimed at scalp care and nothing has worked. I was skeptical to try Wow Apple Cider shampoo because of the price, but am so glad I did!! It has transformed my scalp!! I rarely get sores and the itchiness (which was the worst) is gone! I can’t believe how well it has helped! I made the mistake of trying a shampoo sample I got in a beauty box (just twice!)  and it messed my scalp up. I started to use Wow again and it already has helped. The scent is nice and it is moisturizing. I hate to even say anything negative because it truly is a miracle shampoo for me because of scalp issues, but I feel it makes my hair a tiny bit greasy. I would rather deal with some greasiness than my itchy, sore scalp any day. This shampoo and conditioner has really been a game changer for me!"
4,"After using the same store-bought shampoo and conditioner for years, I did not expect a miracle for my thinning hair, after all, I am 71 years old with fine, thin hair all of my life. The shampoo is pretty good, but the conditioner left  my hair very dry with lots of static. I tried using different amounts of conditioner, to no avail. I tried using the shampoo without any conditioner, not satisfied. Now I use the shampoo with my store-bought conditioner, and it appears to be okay. I need to mention, that due to my active lifestyle, I shampoo my hair daily. The seller is a 10 as to getting me my product, with the fabulous packaging. And I am not complaining about the product, but felt that the seller needs to know, and I am giving an honest review/feedback."
4,"Seems like a great product. Comes with two kids. First one is for transport, second is to replace the other for repeat use, it's not the best. I feels cheap like it will break before I use up the product and can be difficult to open. Otherwise it's a good product. Will buy again."
4,Only tried it 2x so not an expert yet on what it does. Would like a stronger sent. My hair is silky and soft though after washing.
4,"OMG!  I have Irish frizzy hair, and it took me years to come up with a system to reduce frizz.  I have been very loyal to the products I was using.  However lately my hair seemed dryer and my scalp seemed itchy after I washed it (I was about every 3 days) so I read the reviews on this apple cider shampoo and decided let me try something new and hope I'm not stuck with these big bottles of shampoo and conditioner if it doesn't work out.  I love love this shampoo/conditioner!  My hair is so soft, so smooth and smells so good!  Normally when I blow dry my hair it's a massive fuzz ball that I have to tame with the flat iron, but after I finished blow drying it was way smoother and so soft!  It cut my flat iron time by half.  I already told my friend who has frizz issues about Wow. I'm loving it. I only gave it 4 stars b/c it's winter and the real test will be how my hair does in the  summer humidity."
4,"I have only had this product for a week but I can tell it is working with my dry itchy scalp after the first wash.  I wash my hair every other day and so far I am pleased with this.  I am only giving it 4 stars because it is still so new.  Also, I have color treated hair and have not noticed it doing anything with my color which is a good thing!"
4,"Bought the shampoo because it says that helped with dandruff and dry scalp. My daughter has really bad build up and this shampoo works great. As for the conditioner, hair still feels rough and tangly after using. However, the same daughter that has the build up issues loves the conditioner. Her thick wavy hair is loving this conditioner and hers is actually easier to brush."
4,love it so far
4,The product seems very good but I wanted something that was mild but did a better job removing excess oil from my hair.
4,I gave it to a friend who loves it.
4,Leaves a slight film on my hair making it appear a bit oily. Overall pretty good product. This was something new for me to try so after I’m done with it I’ll most likely go back to my previous shampoo and conditioner.
4,"I really like the shampoo and would have given the shampoo 4 stars.  My hair feels so clean after using, and it's gentle on my scalp.  As for the conditioner...nah!  It does not make your hair soft nor does it make your hair easier to brush out after washing.  My error in ordering the pair.  I will reorder the shampoo."
4,So far I really like this shampoo and conditioner ! It smells great which was a plus ! My hair felt very soft after my first use.
4,"I probably should rate the product lower than 4 stars since the product didn't work, but the customer service was great, so I'll leave it as is. The WOW Apple Cider Vinegar shampoo left my hair very dry, even after leaving the WOW Hair Conditioner in for almost 10 minutes. Both the shampoo and conditioner smell great. The shampoo lathers up really nicely and made my scalp feel clean. It's definitely clarifying, maybe too clarifying. The conditioner smelled the best (like coconut), but couldn't tackle the dryness left behind from the shampoo. I think the conditioner would work well when used with a different shampoo. The company was understanding and instantly refunded me."
4,"I suffer from a really dry itchy scalp, and I’ve tried so many different types of shampoos and hair products, and this is the only one that has really helped me so far. The shampoo makes your scalp feel relieved from all of the itchiness. I have also noticed my scalp has been less flaky. The conditioner works really great on my color treated hair and leaves it’s soft and untangled. I usually wash my hair every other day. I rarely leave reviews on products but I had to for this because it really works! I definitely recommend!"
4,"Packaging was great, good amount of product. Scent was good. The shampoo had good lather but not too drying as it didn't feel gross before the application of conditioner. The conditioner was a decent amount of moisturizing and not overly heavy. Left my hair shiny easy to brush manageable and less fizzy. I left both products on my hair before rinsing. I anticipate it to improve after several washes I'm impressed as my expectations were pretty low."
4,Only issues I really have is wish it has pumps you could use like the smaller more expensive ones do.. or an option to at least get a pump to fit these bottles! Hate having to have them upside down just to get some out!
4,"I have been using this for 1 month now. I love this shampoo and my boyfriend does too. Your hair will feel and smell so good and healthy. However, I get really bad dandruff. I hate using head and shoulders so I switched to use Formulate and I really loved how that made my hair feel but it didn’t do enough for my scalp. I was looking for something similar but that would help my scalp issues when I came across this and read some incredible experiences people had with this shampoo. Unfortunately I did not have the same experience as they did. It definitely does a better job of removing flakes and build up, but they end up in my hair instead of on my scalp. My scalp is flaky as ever and I have to was my hair twice a day to keep it flake free. I’m in love with how shiny and healthy my hair is using this shampoo so until I find something that works for my scalp, this is my new go-to. LOVED the packaging it came in! I would give this 5 stars based on how my hair feels and presentation, but I give this product 4 stars because I thought it would do more for my scalp."
4,Very helpful for hair .l like it
4,"Honestly I like the shampoo much more. As a hairstylist I’m always looking for sulfate free shampoos that leave the hair clean but soft and moisturized, the shampoo does just that. I’ve used both products on myself and satisfied with the conditioner but not thrilled. I have course, kinky hair and after 1 shampoo could feel the softness in my hair. And I can see the shine in my clients hair after I’ve used the shampoo. Truthfully I let my husband use the conditioner. Maybe I’ll give the conditioner a few more tries."
4,Works well to help frizz.
4,"I’ve been purchasing this shampoo/conditioner combo for roughly 6 months now. Although the shampoo alone leaves my hair a bit rough, the conditioner combo seems to be the only thing keeping my hair healthy and dandruff free."
4,Left my hair feeling dry and frizzy
4,Keep up the good work love this product
4,"Its great I like it my sister love makes your thicker, soft too"
4,"This product is absolutely amazing! It really gets the residual product out of the hair. My hair felt healthier, not so damaged and dry after one use. The product smells amazing! Also, it is a large portion for the price. This of product is stellar worth of the quality of Aveda or Living Proff"
4,My favorite shampoo. My hair always looks so clean. I can only afford when it’s on sale so I always buy it if I see the deal.  Highly recommend if you can afford it
4,"It didn't have much of a scent i was disapointed,but like the way my hair feels and looks"
4,"First use, a big reduction in hair loss after use. Second use-the same. I was so happy! Then my scalp started feeling sore like I had scratched the whole top of my head. I stopped using it for a 2 week period and tried it again. My scalp soreness returned. I'm going to have to pass on this one. My husband loves it though. It's really doing a great job for him. Since his hair is short, it may be a while before I order again."
4,This product smells amazing. I have always been nervous about trying apple cider vinegar shampoos but you can’t even tell. I did have an issue and the company reached out to me IMMEDIATELY and helped me. They are very helpful and willing to go the extra mile and that in itself says a lot about them and standing behind their products.
4,"Updated:  After the third (wash hair every 3 days or so) I still stick with my first impressions. Hair isn’t really “soft” after washing but once dry feels light and is shiny.I haven’t had more hair loss than normal but no less either. I wouldn’t say my hair is dry because it is not frizzy but a different texture for sure. My scalp is still about the same but it’s only been 3 washes so I will update again!For reference: hair is dark, down to my lower back, fine but a lot of it. I do not blow dry my hair and don’t use heat on it very often anymore. I have psoriasis on my scalp so I’m looking for scalp health.So the package was beautiful and what I would expect for a product of this price.I used the product exactly how the TIPS section suggests because of other reviews. It’s a lot of time for each product but I wanted to try to get the best results possible. (I do not suggest using these before going into work or out unless you have plenty of time). I brushed my hair well before getting into the shower. I used about a palm full of shampoo and massaged it in and let it sit for 5 mins (didn’t smell bad but didn’t smell good), after rinsing, my hair felt a little straw like but not unlike other products for scalp pH.Then I massaged in the thick conditioner (smelled amazing) and left it for 15 mins. Rinsed out very well and my hair didn’t feel weighted down like other deep conditioners I have used. My hair wasn’t really “soft” at this time. I used a wide tooth comb and brushed out my hair and it went pretty well for the amount of tangling that happened during the process. I left to dry overnight.When fully dry my hair felt light and very clean. The itching on my scalp is almost nonexistent after ONE use.Will update as time goes on!"
4,Product is good but my but my scalp is little bit oily so after shampooing next my hair get little oily other wise this is good for dry frizzy hair
4,"I almost didn’t get this bc of the bad reviews, but so far, I’m really liking this- my hair is shiny, my flakes are gone, and I swear my hair has more volume.  BUT shampoo/conditioner is definitely not one size fits all, I think this helped me because my dandruff was being caused by excess build up and my hair is quite oily -I mean one day after my shower it’s already oily, and God forbid I wait another day and it looks like I haven’t showered in weeks LOL.  Honestly, if your dandruff is more because your scalp is dry (bc of climate or something), I wouldn’t recommend this as I can’t see this helping you the same way it helps me- and might even cause so. Now I can’t say definitively if this is helping my hair fall- I think it might be a little, but I’ve only been using this a week, and I try not to expect miracles from products that mere mortals make 😊.  This works a lot better for me than any shampoo I’ve tried (that isn’t $45 for just an 8oz shampoo) and I’m content/happy with that.Keep in mind that I would probably term this as a clarifying shampoo, so if you have normal hair (not oily), I would maybe be careful how often you use this- For oily hair- I’ve been using every other day with no problem and will prob try every day next week to see if it’s too much.So Negatives:1. I was pretty impressed with the shipping set up, but to be honest the caps feel a little cheap and one is hard to open, BUT they actually also come with a twist off caps (that I’m going to save in case one breaks) and I haven’t had too much problem opening them because I’ve been using the lip on the empty red cap that comes with (instead of my finger/fingernails);  if the cap is a deal breaker for you, consider washing out your last shampoo bottle and just using that.2. If it’s very important to you that your conditioner be sulphate free, beware that while the shampoo is sulphate, parabens and silicone free, the conditioner does appear to have sulphates.... for me this isn’t a big deal because I only put conditioner on my hair from the ears down (so it isn’t being put on my scalp); but something to consider none the less!Hope that helps! If for some reason this turns my hair green or it all falls out in a week, I promise to update but so far so good :-)"
4,"i always had a hard time in getting the right shampoo/conditioner for my hair that i would always spend so much money on ""silky shiny hair"" and when i decided to buy this shampoo the WOW really was showen on my face, i really loved this shampoo!!!"
4,"So, I'm not seeing new growth or exceptional volume, but I will say that I'm seeing much less hair in the drain after showering and a lot less coming out while brushing and drying, so that's a bit plus.  I would imagine that eventually I will start seeing thicker, stronger hair just based on the fact that I'm losing so much less of it.  I'm also seeing much less oil accumulation on my scalp, so my hair isn't greasy-looking by the end of the day.  Both the shampoo and the conditioner smell nice, and the shampoo lathers up really easily.  All that being said, they do sell other apple cider vinegar formula products in the grocery store and they are more affordable, so I will probably be trying one of those next for the sake of comparison.  Also, I took off one star for the packaging, because the conditioner really needs to be upside-down in order to come out of the bottle easily."
4,Smell good
4,"I liked the scent, and my hair is softer and it feels fuller."
4,Makes my hair feel nice however I find that the shampoo often feels like it doesn't rinse out all the way. Hasn't really done anything for my dandruff though. Overall I would say it's a nice product though and does make my hair feel nice.
4,Nice and thick..works
4,Does well but can’t use with each wash or leaves hair feeling heavy
4,"Love the product, but not the packaging. The conditioner either needs a pump, or the bottle should be more squeezable. Other than that, I love the way my hair feels when I use it!"
4,The smell in the shampoo is a little strong
4,"I have only used the shampoo. Not the conditioner.The shampoo makes your hair very soft and some people may not need conditioner because there are very few tangles after use.I did find that my hair gets oily faster after using it, but I think it would be a fabulous shampoo for someone who washes their hair every day (like my sister does). It's oil content makes my hair feel heavy.The scent is pleasant without being heavy or perfumey.I won't be purchasing this for myself in the future but I WILL be buying it for my Mom (who loves it)."
4,strengthen hair
4,"Love the shampoo, need a heavier conditioner."
4,"Been using the products for about 2 months now and the shampoo works really well. The conditioner also works well but I had to learn how much to use. Too much left my hair somewhat oily to the touch. Now that I've worked that out, happy with product overall. My hair is softer  and just feels better."
4,Very clean product application and exit. Hair feels smoother.
4,"I love this set, the scent is very nice. The only thing I would say is I don't use it very day, as it can seem a bit heavy."
4,Like using this but can only use once a week. It makes my scalp itch it use to much.
4,This isn't anything special  Its just shampoo with a pleasant scent.  I bought it to try because it was on sale.
4,"I bought these to see if it would help with my psoriasis.  It was a good purchase, and although the flaking has not completely disappeared I think it might be because I don't always leave it the recommended amount of time.  but it does smell really good and it does leave my hair really soft."
4,"Very nice shampoo and conditioner, not as much apple scent as I would have expected. Didn't control frizz as much as I would have thought considering the ingredients. But still a good shampoo and conditioner."
4,"I really like the shampoo, I had some type of growth on my scalp wanted to try this shampoo to see if the growth will go away before I went to the doctor I was amazed after using the shampoo for a week the growth was gone.  The conditioner doesn’t rinse out of my hair very well."
4,Cleaned hair great
4,"Scent is great, scalp feels clean I suppose but still get oiky hair after 3 days and have scalp buildup. However my hair seems a little healthier and softer after each use...still debating on whether I will purchase again."
4,Been using for about a month yes my hair feels a lil softer feel like it's growing more but idk feel like my hair is still frizzy n a lil dry I have thin wavy/curly hair even when I brush still get knots🙄 do love the smell and the conditioner is awesome so will keep using
4,Nicely cleans hairMakes hair feel lighter and softerLight smell of apples and coconutsDon't like the packaging. Flip caps are too small.
4,Loved the natural ingredients and the fact it will be healthy for my hair.
4,"I do really like this product. I've used 3 different kinds of apple cider shampoo and so far this is the best. It does make my hair feel somewhat softer, but it really makes my hair shine. Every time I use it I get asked if I have colored my hair recently, or what product do I use. It definitely brings out the color and makes it look fresh. I would not recommend using this product every day. Eventually it stops working as well, as with most hair products. This shampoo is more designed to keep hair vibrant and fresh for longer periods of time but if you are one that needs to wash your hair every day due to your line of work, gym etc. it might not be the best choice. My recommendation for that would be to use this shampoo once or twice a week and use another shampoo every other day."
4,I do not want to use any other shampoo or conditioner. But need to use this longer to say it's great
4,"The shampoo feel dry on the hair making it a bit harder to wash off but the conditioner makes it all better. My head feels clean, hair light and shiny."
4,Bought this to help with breakage for my hair but it didn’t help. Makes my hair feel really dry and it caused me to have a lot of Dandruff. The only thing I like about this is the smell!.
4,"I love this product. I would have given this 5 stars but, the caps they send are so cheap. I dropped my bottle in the shower the cap broke in pieces and my shampoo ran out. My hair is softer and more manable since using this. I recommend this product just try to find some different caps."
4,I’m glad I found this product. It has helped my itchy scalp and is kind to my hair.
4,The smell is great and it makes my hair super thick. Thicker than any other combo I’ve ever used. But it doesn’t make my hair soft. It’s hard to brush they wet. And yes my hair will fall out in a large clump if I don’t dry it first. Overall I like it... my dandruff and itchy scalp has cleared up... not sure if I’d buy again... unless I get a leave in conditioner to add to my routine.
4,"Those of you who have a dry scalp, psoriasis or dandruff know that it takes time to get rid of or improve these conditions.  I’ve use this product for a few of months now I’m on my second order but found that it didn’t help my psoriasis in fact it kind of made it worse. I had more itching and scaling. however, it did increase the volume of my hair and it made it soft and look shinier and I did get more compliments after using the product. Love the look of my hair after using it.  I’m not relying on this product to cure my dry scalp. I gave it four stars because it’s advertised as a product that helps improve dry scalp and psoriasis and in my case it did not."
4,Been using the shampoo and conditioner for little over a week. So far so good. My scalp seems to be getting what it needs. Trying to get use to my hair's new feeling though. This product makes my hair soft but also a bit weighted I guess.
4,"Love love love the shampoo especially, leaves my hair super soft, conditioner is good too but the shampoo is the best. I would recommend.I can’t say if it makes my hair grow in thicker from my scalp, might know in a few months if I see evidence of new growth I’ll re review it."
4,Itchy scalp.  Conditioner did not untangle my hair very well after each use.
4,Great product. All natural ingredients and effective results.
4,"This product strips your hair of all buildup from past hair products. I feel my hair is softer and looks fuller. Also, my hair is color treated and this had a natural, healing effect."
4,I do hair for a living so I am a tough critic... I do like this shampoo/conditioner! I purchased for the shine factor and yes it works!
4,"It's extremely cleansing, I have noticed new growth, the conditioner smells great but it's very tough to get out tangles."
4,"Ok. When I recieved this the shampoo bottle was only 3/4 full. The conditioner bottle was full. Now on to the results of using this. The smell is a little awkward, kinda between honey and apples. The shampoo is ok but what I found most helpful was the conditioner.  It only takes a small amount because I didnt learn this at first but adding a little water to your hair after applying the conditioner does bring about some lathering . I let set a little longer then called for in instructions.  My hair does seem lots smoother but I have dry thick hair so I do use a BB leave in cream conditioner for extra softness. One thing I have noticed is that this doesnt lasts very long as the texture is thick so it doesnt take long before it is used up. Also after using for a few weeks now, I notice some itching of the scalp. I do believe the apple Cider vinegar tends to dry the scalp after long term use. It would be great if the company could add an ingredient that would benefit the scalp. It works on the hair pretty good. If you have thick coarse hair like I do, a leave in treatment is definitely necessary. I also feel this shampoo is too pricey."
4,shampoo was ok but not enoughbof a difference in ny hair tge scent was ok
4,The shampoo really does get the buildup out but almost makes the hair to squeaky clean.  Wish the conditioner was a little more moisturizering. Once hair is dry I do love the outcome.
4,The shampoo provided enough lather but not much scentThe conditioner Smelled like coconuts but I had to use a lot on my hair which is only shoulder length
4,Good shampoo. Just doesn’t soap well. I need to soap hair 2-3 times. Maybe because it is an organic ......
4,My wife loves them.I got them for her.
4,It worked well first few times... then started making my hair feel like straw ... like overly clarifying. Also stripped my color...
4,"If you have natural (curly) hair, it's a good ""once a month"" shampoo. I wouldn't use it weekly or biweekly. It'll strip your hair. That first wash, the shampoo is very moisturizing. The conditioner doesn't seem to do much for moisture at all, but it does help a better detangle if you detangle with conditioner. The second wash, my hair felt dry and brittle, or hard."
4,I have been usng harsh products. WOW gave better results.
4,"I like the products. I think I might have enjoyed them more had my hair been easier to comb after the shampoo but my hair IS soft and shiny, and was not at all fly-away.I am glad to continue using the product."
4,My hair had low porosity and my curls were feeling wired and looking unruly.  Since using the Apple cider vinegar shampoo and conditioner my hair has been improving and I shampoo and condition at least twice a week.
4,"This product did what it said, for the most part. My hair is much healthier and full since using this product.  And, it is definitely not as frizzy.  The smell could be a little better,  but then, it would probably take away from the effects of this product.  I would recommend this product."
4,We have been using this pair for a year now and we find it extremely good. The shampoo and conditioner makes your hair soft and voluminousI would certainly recommend this pair to everyone...
4,It makes my hair feel health and soft and so clean.
4,"The ACV shampoo fixed so many scalp problems for me. I had oily scalp, dandruff, and acne. Within two weeks of using this, my scalp is happier than it's ever been. I used to have to wash my hair almost every day, otherwise I would be a greasy and pimply mess, and now I can now go every other day. Sometimes, when I'm feeling adventurous, I'll even go three days.The one thing I do wish Wow would do is sell the shampoo separately. So far as I've found, the shampoo and conditioner must come as a set, but I'm going through the shampoo much faster than the conditioner. Might have to try another ACV shampoo when I run out."
4,I like most of it.
4,The product is very good. But its very thick and sticky. I mixed with almond oil and using it. Now its easy to spread.
4,It seems a little more loose in texture than before but overall I am Ok with the product.
4,It's my first time to use. I like that so far.
4,Product is great have to use more to cover tho wish bottle was bigger tho
4,"Good product, doesn't have much scent, and effective!"
4,Great for my skin and hair.
4,"Kind of smells like popcorn butter at the movie  theaters.  It’s super thick but moisturizes hair really well, I Leave it in overnight and wash thoroughly in the morning.  If you are looking for hair growth and thickening well I am too.  I put this on overnight 2-3 times a week I’ve noticed my hair looking healthier and friends have told me that too (I have dry damaged hair).  I haven’t notice too much hair growth yet I’ve been using it for about 3 weeks."
4,"Used for a month now. I am applying it every week and doing hair mask for overnight. I don't think it works as described by 5 star reviewers. I don't see any improvement although felt getting little bald and falling more hairs thn usual. Not sure because of product or my diet and stress. But i see people said overnight mask is working like giving much improvement with photos. I really didn’t see any improvement as 5 star reviewers described. Felt to check average or 1 star review before buying. Also the product is not worthy as priced. I can buy same castor oil in Indian store for 6.99 for the same size.It makes my hair look little dark after washing it. So if you are struggling with grey hairs. The product is quite good. But the same thing I feel with Indian store castor oil. So, I won’t recommend it.Bought this only because see the pictures 5 star reviewers has shared."
4,The flip top makes it easy to put just enough on your hands for the correct amount.
4,"It's watery, not oily.  I prefer oily .  I've only been using a few days, so check back in a few weeks if interested. Has no smell."
4,"I like how that I can warm up the oil, that help it easier to spread. Also I use it to help my hair grow I have seen more growth.  I will buy it again."
4,I have been using this Castor oil for my face for a few weeks now and my skin looks AMAZING... I found the oil cleansing method when everything else didn't work and I wish I would have found it sooner!!!
4,I think it is great for eyebrows and lashes. When I tried to run it through my hair it was a little too thick though and was almost sticky. Other than that it is great!
4,I used for a while meaning about 2 months and yes it helps with the growth of your hair believe me. I freaking started looking like a porcupine 😂. I just stopped using because honestly I didn’t have time to look for it after moving things around and misplacing it.
4,Helps in hair growth
4,"I really like this brand of Castro oil, I mostly use it on my hair."
4,good quality and good price.  ha hair loss and scalp drying/
4,Great moisturizer
4,Great product!
4,"This is very thick! My recommendation would be to dilute with Jojoba oil to make it easy to spread. For it to work properly use conditioner to rinse it out properly. It does make your hair shinier and softer, but make sure you rinse out well or you will look greasy."
4,Good Product
4,"No particular smell, works best if we heat the oil a little bit before applying."
4,The product is great. There is no smell and I mix with my lotion
4,"Very, very, very thick. I am not a fan of the scent but it is an earthy natural scent. Lots of oil in the bottle. It has given my eyelashes shine and it has grown my hair with my oil mixture of this oil, extra virgin olive oil (the majority of the mixture), sweet almond oil, and coconut oil. Its very nice and worth the cost. The only castor oil that's actually shown me results."
4,I like that it makes my hair soft and moisturized. Been using it over a month but haven't seen much noticeable hair growth yet but we'll see....
4,good quality
4,"The product is great. The bottle was quite the challenge to open, I guess for safe secure delivery; we had to get the pliers out."
4,I have been using this for almost 3 weeks now. I usually apply in the morning and at night for the best results.
4,It's fine.
4,I haven’t tried it yet but my friends and family love it and I believe them! You can too!😊
4,"After using this product, I felt like my hair felt fuller and would hold better. The bottle says to apply it on dry hair but I found it easier if the hair is a little damp, because it made it easier to spread on the scalp. It doesn’t smell bad and it doesn’t smell good, but I mean you don’t really buy it to make your hair smell good. If it did have a good smell then it would be a bonus. Overall great product, the bottle will last quite a while."
4,"Coming from an actual amazon buyer, there is a couple of things you should know about this product. First thing is, although it's an ""oil"" it's not oily!!! It's actually pretty thick and sticky so it makes it harder to spread which is the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Second I don't recommend using it on your eyelashes at night, if you do, put very little because you will wake up with bloodshot eyes. I have been using it for over a month now on my eyelashes and my hair, here are my results.  I have been using it on my eyelashes 2-3 times a week during the day and my eyelashes have become so long AND FULL (Btw: my lashes were damaged from lash extension; naturally my eyelashes aren't long). For only a month use, i think it's worked pretty quickly. On my hair, I have only been using it once a week as a mask usually for about an hour before I shower. I have very damaged hair from bleaching, and this product has definitely made my hair softer. It's also made it fuller in an area that I considered my ""bald spot"". I will start using it twice a week now to see more results. But i love this product so far!"
4,Its really thick just have to heat it up before use... But other than that I like it
4,Darn near 100% of the time I will buy based on reviews. I bought this because my hair is thin and falls out. Reviews say it makes their hair grow and less hair falls out. Idk how this many ppl can say this stuff makes their hair grow because mine hasn’t. I’ve had two hair professionals tell me growth needs to come from within. Treating topically won’t promote growth. With that being said I will definitely keep using this product simply because the day after using it (I apply at night once a week and wash in the am) I have pretty amazing hair days a few days following. I also mix with a little almond and lavender essential oil just because castor oil is pretty thick. I don’t have a specific measurement but I use mostly castor then a little of both sweet almond and lavender.
4,Amazing product!
4,Bought this 2nd time to gift it. Healthy for hair growth
4,Okay this is great but it’s SUPER thick. You need to blend it with some water and thin it up so you can spread it better if you use it in your hair. ... but if you wanna use it on your lashes or brows then you can just use it regularly and get a little on a a-tip and then apply it and it’s fine like that !
4,well it thought it was edible as it said organic (i assumed).
4,"I haven’t used it yet but from my understanding, you can’t go wrong with castor oil."
4,"It’s quite messy, but it works wonders! Definitely make sure to rub off all excess oil. Fantastic for eyebrows and eyelashes, but if you use it on your hair sleep with a towel on your pillow it is very greasy"
4,It is a good product that I have used so far. Just wished it would come with a dropper for the oil.
4,"Not being an expert on castor oil, I would say this oil is fine"
4,"Sorry, my review will not be of help. I bought the castor oil to mix with dish detergent and water to spray on the number of gopher holes in my yard. Hope it works!"
4,I put this in my bath water along with Epsom salts which is a detoxing soak for me. I like this.
4,I used this on my hamster and his hair has grown SO much. It is now past his eyes. I refuse to cut it cause it’s adorable seeing him run into things. 🥰 10/10 recommend.
4,I just started using it so I can only comment that it moisturizes my scalp well and does not have a bad odor.
4,Good one
4,I've only used it for 2 weeks.  I hope to see some new hair growth soon.
4,Nice packaging! Easy to apply
4,Love it been using for 2 weeks already see a difference in my lashes!! However I do mix with jojoba oil so it’s easier to glide on my lashes.
4,"Well packed & Delivery was on time. It is a much thicker oil then others, so mixing up with another couple of drops of another oil would be easier to apply to you hair or skin. It is to early to tell, but so so far so good. I will update my outcome in a month. I have nothing negative to say about it. Will upgrade it to 5 ⭐️ once I prove the efficacy of the product."
4,Bought this for my lashes and brows to help them grow and it does you just need to be consistent. It doesn't necessarily have a scent. The consistency is very thick and a little goes a long way.
4,Perfect! I bought it for hair growth after chemotherapy.
4,"I just started using the castor oil, but so far I like it overall. There is no scent which is fine. It’s a little on the thick side and a little sticky. I do like the price for the amount you get! This bottle will last me a long time!"
4,Moisturizing and smell is not bad.
4,Cannot compares with other product but i like it
4,this castor oil has a natural scent and it's thick so it's hard to spread easily on you're head. I eventually bought almond oil to help spread the oil more. I'm not sure if it's working on growing out my hair yet but I am determined. Will update if anything changes.
4,Worked great
4,I like it!
4,"Good value, make my hair soft and moisturize. Recommend it!"
4,I bought this product for hair growth. I have been putting it in my hair and on my eye lashes for quite some time now. I have noticed no difference in my hair but a MAJOR difference in my lashes. I will definitely be purchasing this again!
4,"I have just used it once on my scalp. Bought it for hair strengthening and growth. Have friends that have had positive resulta with Castor oil. Left in on my scalp for 2 hours. Was pleased that is does not have a strong smell, it is barely noticeable. It is a bit tricky to wash out, took like 4 shampoos. The result was fabulous, my hair felt thicker ( I guess some of the oil lightly sticks to the hair to protect. My hair was shiny, bouncy, it looked wonderful. It has been years since my hair did not look like that. I will continue using it once a week. Gave it a 4 star, because I have only used it once."
4,Love it! And it works great for my daugther.. its my second bottle!
4,Great product will update
4,"I bought this for use in my hair. It is extremely thick and sticky. There is no smell and it is somewhat hard to apply because it is so thick. However, it does help moisturize. I am starting to mix this with my coconut oil. It is easier to apply."
4,"No complaints when it comes to the actual castor oil; which is the most important bit anyway. I’ve used it as a hairmask, eyebrow and lash conditioner.My only issue is the leaking bottle design, you definitely need to transfer to another container because this is sticky, leaks and gets EVERYWHERE."
4,I liked itI mix it in my coconut oil n apply in hairs 1s a while
4,Doesn't seem to work as well as Jamaican black castor oil grew my hair faster
4,I like it a lot...
4,I tried after reading all the great comments. I used it for 2 months and noticed more hair fall with castor oil and discontinued using it!
4,Love
4,This castor oil is really good for growing out your eyelashes and eyebrows I don’t recommend putting it on your scalp though because it makes your hair really icky and takes shampooing many times to get out the residue
4,"Great for the price, gives good coverage and lasts longer than most eyeliners."
4,"I got this hoping it would be my new favorite eyeliner because of how great the reviews are, but unfortunately as soon as i put it on my skin it felt like a burning sensation. I could just be allergic to something in the liner, but i have sensitive skin so i’m guessing it’s that. But my sister tried it and loved it!! So it just depends on the type of skin you have."
4,"Decent eyebrow pencil. Looks a bit fake when i put it on, but works well and stays on pretty much throughout the day"
4,"I've been using Kat Von D's Tattoo Liner for a couple of years and while it's very solid, finding an inexpensive dupe is what I was aiming for. Nyx's eyeliner sealed the deal for me and actually applied a better line to my eyes than the tattoo liner. However, after a month of using this the felt tip developed a tall like feather and it wouldn't go down so I had to repurchase. Hopefully I don't experience that again with this repurchase!"
4,"This is a good eyeliner, stays all day. It has a tendency to smudge while putting it on, but cleans up easily with a Q-tip. It could be me! It comes off easily with make up remover wipes. I would definitely buy this again!"
4,"This eyeliner is sufficiently pigmented for me (more pigmented than Clinique Pretty Easy Liquid Eyeliner at any rate). I have monolids so eyeliners inevitably get stuck in eyecrease without primer, so I also bought Nyx Proof-It Primer, which worked really well and made this virtually smudge-proof -- once its dry, which takes about 5 seconds for me. Decent purchase for the price, though the cap can bend the outer hairs of the brush if youre not careful."
4,the brush gets kind of messed up but it’s good
4,"Good price ,easy to use ,water proof nice eyeliner"
4,"I have no idea what happened, but I thought this product was absolutely wonderful until the ink was suddenly all over my hands and my counter. Still have no clue what happened.Design of the eyeliner container: 2/5Eyeliner itself: 5/5I'll give it a 4, because I really do like the eyeliner - better even than the Kat Von D eyeliner!"
4,"Nicely water resistant, make sure to store upside down though (brush side down) or it practically has no product."
4,"It's a good liner, but not matte enough for me.  A bit too shiney for my likings."
4,Super nice! Very liquidity so just be careful. Stays on long and comes off easy at the end of the day. It will smudge if you like lay down or rub your face too much but good quality.
4,"What I liked from this product is how pigmented it is on the eye and how long it lasted but even as hours went by it mange to leave extra black liner on my eye lid. But it long lasting black liner it really good by staying on. Though it lasted when my brother splash me with water, so I hope you give this product a try."
4,Love the ease of use but staying power leaves something to be desired. Sweats off.
4,Love love love this eyeliner. Glides on easy and has stayed on during multiple swims in the pool. I rate it 4 stars because sometimes the product forms a small bubble of ink on the plastic towards the felt tip. This has happened to me with two different eyeliners I’ve purchased. I usually just wipe it away and continue using. It doesn’t make a mess it’s just sort of annoying. I have heard of other users complain about this same thing. Hopefully the company can fix this packaging issue because the product is 10/10 otherwise.
4,Love the liner. Stays on well and very durable. The one issue I have had with the last 2 times I've ordered is that it frays pretty bad.
4,As advertised.  A little thick but good
4,"Loved it! Easy application, professional looking and long lasting!"
4,"I went swimming and it all came off, but no smudges. It's not a jet black dark as I usually prefer but it lasts and day and the price is good."
4,"This is a pretty decent eyeliner, especially since it is much cheaper than other eyeliners of the same quality. The one complaint I have is that the little hairs on the edges have started folding out at a 90 degree angle because of the lid closing on them, making it difficult to put the eyeliner on without getting marks on my cheeks. I’ve read that other people have that problem too, so be very very careful when putting the lid on! The eyeliner lasts a long time and doesn’t smudge, so that’s good enough for me!"
4,"Really great, but the ink color was a little duller than I'd like."
4,"It’s definitely not water proof but it’s still really good. Although, I’ve bought 4 and they all seem to end up the same way, the liquid eyeliner will leak from the sides of the brush and form bubbles from the leaks."
4,A bit thin but it dries nicely
4,"Very dark black, but doesn't go on as well as other brands I have used, but for the price, it's pretty good."
4,"Ok to start off I needed a new eyeliner since my old one ran out of ink. I really liked it and it had a felt tip. I decided to try out a new one and this has a brush tip. The brush tip is in the same shape of the felt one but made up of tiny little bristles. I really liked this new eyeliner because the ink had really good pigment, it didn’t skip, and it actually let me get really sharp lines. I had a huge problem with the bristles because they kept going in different directions. I solved this by tweezing the individual bristles. I would buy this again but be careful how I use it because the bristles get ruin easily. Otherwise than that, the eyeliner is one of the best I’ve tried!✨"
4,Not smudge proof or water resistant. But a good eye-liner in general. Color is good and works well. Easy to apply.
4,I like this eyeliner; I would recommend this eyeliner to friends.
4,It’s okay
4,"This stuff flakes off pretty easily, which is a shame because I was really hoping it would be good. You have to go over some of the lines more than once because the pen doesn’t leave a good solid line, and it feels crunchy almost, sometimes you take the other eyeliner off with it. You get what you pay for"
4,"The eyeliner is good. Last for all day and kind of waterproof. But the eyeliner is not oil-proof, so maybe good in winter, but not good in summer. But overall, it's a good dup for kvd tattoo eyeliner."
4,"Was looking for a replacement for my Stila. The Nyx performs well on top lid, but smudged if using under eye at all.  Performs well, would purchase / use again"
4,It goes on slick and easy and stays on a good amount of time.
4,Its really dark and applies fast but it moves throughout the day and sometimes it transfers onto the top of your eyelid even after its dried.
4,It’s so perfect I love it but it does smudge a little bit sadly
4,Easy to apply and great price
4,Works great!
4,"Glides on nicely. Deposits good color. Lasts pretty well unless you are heavily sweating.  Like an intense hour long plus workout, It smudged."
4,Works well
4,For a cheaper brand it didn’t disappoint like some of the higher end brands have. I actually choose to use this one over my $40 liner. NYX has come a long way!
4,"I want to love this eyeliner, but it is only above average. The applicator is great and makes drawing a cat eyes easy, and the smooth liquid eyeliner is opaque and covers completely. However, while the eyeliner does not smudge easily, it does kind of flake off of you happen to forget you're wearing it and rub your eye. Its water resistance is ok but not perfect. Sweat makes it easily rubbed off. Fort the price, though, it is good enough for daily wear."
4,"This gives you a nice line. Also bold color.I find I have enough time to fix my goofs before it dries down. Didn't last on my lower lashline.  Which is normal for me.Feathers even over powder eyeshadow.  I did qtip setting powder over it with some success.  Using pale, shimmering eyeshadow also works pretty well.  Still feathers if you look too closely but line is fine from mirror distance."
4,Very much not water proof. If it gets touched stall with water or tears on it...it smudges and disappears. As long as you don't cry and your eyes don't water...you're gold! It does make nice fliks and cat eyes.
4,I have bought this product multiple times. I like the application and the wear. HOWEVER every time I purchase it the same thing happens. By the forth or fifth use the bristles widen and get caught inside the cap. The next time you use it there are random bristles sticking out. I usually try to remove them with tweezers but it’s a pain. That being said it stays on well and is easy to apply prior to the crazy bristle issue. The price makes it tolerable as well.
4,"It’s very easy to use, has a good flow and creates nice lines. It stays in place but will start to flake off after wearing it for an entire day."
4,"I like this eyeliner a lot.It doesn’t irritate my sensitive eyes, it goes on easily and accurately and lasts until you take it off.The only negative thing I have to say is that the top is so tough to pull off. The product itself is excellent and deserves 5 stars it got 4 from me because of the amount of strength needed to get off the top."
4,Good mascara. Doesn’t smudge and is somewhat water resistant. Does last all day. Great product for the money!
4,I love this eyeliner and buy it every couple of monthsBut this time I ordered the 2 pack and only received 1! Who do I contact
4,GF likes
4,"I *love* this eyeliner so much! If you like a minimalistic look that just enhances, this is almost perfection. The only reason I knocked a star off is that by night it's pretty faded. But it is so easy to apply. I hadn't worn makeup in years, and I always messed up eyeliner no matter what type I tried. When this arrived I applied it *perfectly* very first try. Super thin, hardly showed, which is what I was going for, but I'm certain it would be quite easy to build up however you need. Even cat eyes would be easy since drawing steady and neatly is easy."
4,I had high hopes for this eyeliner based on reviews.  I found it applies evenly & liner came out smoothly to the applicator after shaking it a few times.  Nice application overall.  The liner lasted maybe 5 hours before I noticed it was starting to flake off.  I touched it with my finger & I could have wiped it off without much effort.  Don't think its truly water proof.  I won't buy again.
4,"It dries dark black, easy to use brush tip, stays put as long as you let it dry before moving your eye lids too much. Really beats a lot of other drug store eyeliner (Elf, Wet N Wild, etc). It’s my personal go to"
4,"I LOVE this eyeliner. Works really great, easy to use, but over time it smudges and kinda fades but I think it’s great."
4,Overall one of my favorite eyeliners. Nice application. Only issue is that some “hairs” will stick out which I cut out with little scissors. Daughter loves it too.
4,My only dislike is the felt tip started to fray pretty quickly. Otherwise this is an amazing liner.
4,My first liquid liner and still in the learning curve. Sometimes the wings end up thicker and longer trying to fix it. Be patient and do non dominant side first!Stays very well and removed with a wipe.
4,Christmas gift
4,Love this! No smudges it's pretty much water proof and lasts all day!
4,"It’s pretty easy to put on, this was my first liquid eyeliner so I don’t really have anything to compare it to but there are a few things to note. You have to be super careful putting the cap back on because my bristles got messed up and frayed making it less precise for the future uses. I do find that it does fade throughout the day and can smudge."
4,"This eye liner is easy to use. It applies super dark with sleek lines (which is what I wanted). It doesn't always last throughout the day though, and may need to be reapplied around midday. I wouldn't say it is waterproof, because it smudges with tears."
4,"I’ve struggled with finding a liquid eyeliner pen that doesn’t dry out super quick, especially the tip. I can get such clean and bold lines with this liner, and for that price? Worth it. It’s super easy to take off, and has lasted me all day when i’m sweating at work!"
4,I typically use avon but decided to try this.  It is good and does the job
4,My favorite eyeliner by far. Only issue is that it tends to fray after a while.
4,"I've been using this for a bit and all i can really say it that it is just fine, i overall looks good. It's more or less smudge poof and holds for about a day, the water resistance is fine just don't rube it and it will be fine underwater"
4,I am not great with liquid liner but this is a good one to practice with.
4,"I really love this. It goes on super smooth, but it doesn't last as long as I would like, but that's because I use extremely thick lines. Towards the end of the day I have to reapply the thicker parts of my wings."
4,Good product
4,"Of all the eyeliners I've tried, this one really makes it easy to get both eyes to match with a variety of dramatic looks. The eyeliner glides on smoothly, leaving crisp lines. It does take a little while to dry (apply some powder immediately) and its water resistance is only moderate. But the effect it creates compensates for these limitations."
4,"I knocked off a star because I've had to reapply as it doesn't fill in as well as I'd like. However, for the price and the ability of it staying all day, it's really good. I can take another 10 seconds and apply around my lash line as needed and save money using this liner. I specifically read reviews comparing this eyeliner vs the Stila eyeliner. I've been extremely loyal to the Stila eyeliner but it was always just a wince from me to justify spending that much money on just some eyeliner. I'm very happy I found this as a good compromise! I've used NYX products before and have really liked them, so this was a great product to try out without dropping $25+!"
4,"Obviously can't give this 5 stars, but it is so cheap why not buy a couple.You have to warm it up a little (as in draw on something else) for a few times until the color shows in. Otherwise, pretty good.I do have to say though if you happen to get it in your eye it will hurt so don't do that. Maybe if you a re sensitive stay away and check the ingredients list very carefully."
4,Stays and doesn't run but irritates my eyes. I don't have sensitive skin and usually never react badly to make up but it irritates my eyes a bit.
4,I loved this eyeliner but for some reason mine started to explode. Great eyeliner though
4,Good product especially for the money and wears well.
4,Takes a little time to make sure the line is straight
4,I love this eyeliner marker. So easy to use and at a great price point! The marker is sharp to a point and very black so it's easy to create the perfect eyeliner shape. It lasts for hours but it's not completely smudge-proof. It is not waterproof either but fairly water-resistant. Overall its worth trying- I will continue to use for the ease of use and great value.
4,it’s okay
4,"When you first use it, the pigment goes on opaque and smooth, yet after a few uses it seems like the pen is already drying up. It could definitely be a batch issue, but I'm uncertain since I bought two. Despite its pitfalls, you can get defined lines with it. The tip is firm but it's soft enough to not cause irritation."
4,I love the brush because it is so nice and wet so it glides really well.  It smudges more than i had expected and not as water resistant. but overall i would buy another one.
4,It’s wonderful eyeliner.. I use it every day .. I gave it 4 out 5 because it’s kind of difficult to open the cap.
4,This was so easy to put on. And im a beginner again lol. So many years of permanent tattoo eyeliner & now can't find another person that's good to redo them. Had to go back to this.
4,"The price is pretty unbeatable. In a pinch and on a budget, this eyeliner works perfectly fine. Application is easy and for daily wear, it can easily last a month or two.But it does smudge very easily and it is not long lasting and usually requires me to fix it up throughout the day. It’s difficult to get very sharp, concise lines with this eyeliner.If you’re looking for long lasting, high quality eyeliner, you’re going to want to increase your budget. But for the price, this eyeliner can get the job done for the most part."
4,Waterproof and very dark i like it
4,"This is good.  It goes on well, you can use a qtip to correct it, but it isn't really waterproof.  It is pretty good staying though.  so.  Okay."
4,Works amazing and lasts very long although it does smudge a bit especially threw the summer heat.
4,"The only eyeliner I will buy. It lasts 24+ hrs and doesn’t smudge. It doesn’t come off when I sweat either. I’ve slept in it and woken up with perfect wings if that gives you any idea. My only complaint is that the tip will fray, no matter how careful you are putting the cap back on. This doesn’t get in the way of doing eyeliner, it’s just aesthetically annoying."
4,Liked the pen very much Just need a little more practice with it.
4,Love how this eyeliner goes on. Super easy to create a thin wing. Only complaint was that after a while it started to fray a bit and then I found it one day in my makeup bag bleeding all over everything. I would definitely recommend it since it's at such a good price but be prepared to replace it once it starts to fray.
4,I love how black this eyeliner is I just wish it didn't come off so easily.
4,"I’ve used this product since I was 15 so I was aware of the quality when I bought it. For those who are first time buyers, know that this bleeds after a few hours or less and is very difficult to take off. Otherwise, it’s easy to use and shape your liner with. Sharp tip makes it easy to do a simple cat eye. Overall feeling: you get what you pay for."
4,"It works well I'm just garbage at applying it right as I rarely use makeup. It hasn't leaked or anything for me which seems to be a regular issue for the reviews. But fair warning, if you blink at all within 30 seconds of applying it you're probably gonna end up with a black splotch on your eyelid. It's not very smudge-proof until it dries which takes a bit longer than expected."
4,"I have used this eyeliner daily and exclusively for years. It's great for winged eyeliner with staying power and can make a very sharp point. My only criticism is that after a few months, something seems to change and it becomes more like actual ink (more watery, difficult to get a fine line, and doesn't dry). In this case the planned obsolescence is fine with me since I take that as my cue to replace my eye makeup (it does seems to happen every 3-4 months). The brush also frays a bit after a while, but again, that just means it's time to get a new one."
4,"Easy to use, not really water proof though"
4,"Please don't just use soap and water. You will look like a raccoon. Doesn't smudge too bad after drying, but definitely not smudge PROOF."
4,"I am giving this 4 stars. It would easily be a 5 star product all the way if the product was consistent! It’s actually my favorite eyeliner pen and I have tried a ton, including Fenty and the cult favorite, Stila. Both of those work pretty well, but the NYX goes on solid, stays on, and I can get that precise wing I want! I can’t get as precise with the Fenty one but the color is very black. The Stila is precise but the color isn’t as black.Now the bad part. I have bought 5 of these and 2 have been defective. They have been super leaky which made the pen all blotchy and not work well at all. Amazon is great about replacing bad ones. But it still sucks that I don’t know what I’ll get. I can’t find anything better so I keep buying and hoping I get a good one!"
4,"Goes on nicely, and lasts throughout the day. I wouldn’t call it truly water resistant, it flakes off a bit with water. The product also drips a little sometimes when you take the cap off"
4,I love how this product works but the applicator gets frayed pretty quickly from putting the cap on and that makes it so you can’t use it for as long as you would normally be able to. I have had it happen with every single one I have purchased.
4,"At first, I loved this eyeliner. Then towards the middle of its life, it started getting very runny. Way too much eyeliner would come running out and it would be impossible to apply without blotting it with a tissue. Towards the end of its life (which it didn’t even last me as long as my previous Avon eyeliners), the brush hairs started sticking out. I noticed someone else in the reviews had this comment as well. I don’t know if it’s poor cap design or just user error, but it was certainly annoying having the brush hairs sticking out as I was trying to apply it.UPDATE: I bought it a second time and had none of the problems I had the first time. Not sure if the quality varies each time you get it, but I will be buying again!"
4,"Good eyeliner!! Easy to use and applies well. HOWEVER, if you have it on especially in your water line and you cry it burns really bad. So if ur planning on crying don’t wear it :) it hurts. but other than that good eyeliner."
4,"So let me make this fast. My review is mostly positive, with a catch. So the eyeliner is indeed smudge proof, so that's great. It is also somewhat waterproof and sweatproof. By that, I mean I spent hours outside on a hot day, sweating and running and my eyeliner did not budge. However, I noticed that when the waterproof and smudge resistance were both tested at the same time, ie. rubbing your eye while sweating or crying, the eyeliner fails. So basically, if you're sweating or wet, DO NOT RUB OR TOUCH YOUR EYES! The eyeliner will come off. Otherwise, just lightly dab any sweat or water off your face, let it dry, and you're eyeliner will be more or less unscathed. Overall very happy with the product for the price point."
4,Bold black color but smudges easily.
4,Def NOT for beginners lol. But overall great product.
4,I like this product. It glides on with ease. I just wish it lasted longer
4,It’s very pigmented and has the potential to last all day .. however I have very oily skin and have no problem sumdging this off through the day. Untouched this can easily last all day but the slightest touch leaves me with racoon eyes.
4,"Easy to use and glides on good but mine is super like, juicy and runs very easily."
4,Good but it’s super annoying that I can’t even put the cap on without bending the brush!!!!
4,"Easy and precise application. It stays all day (and I live in a tropical climate). It's a bold black. If the ingredients were less scary, it would have been my holy grail."
4,"Good stuff! But both of mine leaked, near the tip. Otherwise would be 5 stars. Stays in place. Stays on after using eyelash curler. Easily removed with makeup wipes. All in all, worth it. Will buy again."
4,The quality is fine. It seems like it dries out kind of quick. I haven't used it much and the ink already seems to be running a little low. I shook it up a little and that helped some. I like the felt tip and works well for fine lines and winged edges.
4,"It’s flaky. If you blink, crusty lines show up where you eyelid skin has folded. It’s kinda of waterproof when it dries and doesn’t smudge all the much. But it’s will flake off into a hot mess making your winged eyeliner look like you just got back from a horrible one night stand. Beautiful application though. Love the brush used to apply the eyeliner. Perfect precision."
4,Nice thin lines that don't smudge.
4,This eyeliner is great! Could take a little practice for those whose are beginners and are not used to applying eyeliner. I am not a beginner but (for example) it took me a few tries to make it look like my usual eyeliners I hope this is helpful! I gave it 4 and 5 stars because it doesnt smudge! And that's something every women wants!
4,My daughter likes it a lot she loves eyeliner and need some more so she ordered this. It smudged a little a few times but not much so I think I will buy this for her again.
4,"This makes applying eyeliner so much easier! The marker tip is easy to use, it provides a nice, opaque black and lasts very long. Smudging is a small problem, but this is by far the best eyeliner I’ve used so far"
4,This eyeliner is beautiful and is very easy to apply. It lasted me hours even after taking a nap. My only complaint is that it smudges easily (even before my nap)
4,"Good product, easy to apply— the applicator and tip are great!  Also stays on well!"
4,"Lovely product. The price matches the result, I have had zero smudging and didn’t have to reapply to get the opacity desired."
4,"For me, eyeliner is one of my makeup staples. I wear eyeliner for about 10 hrs a day so finding an eyeliner that does not smear or smudge is important for me. The NYX liquid eyeliner is very pigmented in color but for my skin type (normal to combination skin) I found that it would start smudging after sever hours of use. For the price it's an ok eyeliner. The brush is very precise and glides on smoothly. I like to try out new makeup brands, and am always looking for dupes to the Kat Von D eyeliner."
4,"Long wearing, beautiful application and doesn’t smudge easily"
4,Easy to apply.Dark black.Long lasting.Smudges a little if one has oily eyelids that are hooded.
4,"Very good for the price. This is my go to liner. And I do enjoy it. The only reason it is not 5 starts is when compared to brands like Stella , urban decay or Eyeko it falls just a little short."
4,"it does get smudge after about 9hrs..but other than that, it's really easy to use & I would recommend."
4,Works good.
4,"Really good and durable eyeliner, but it dried out really quick."
4,Love this as a back up liner. As long as you give it a few seconds to set it stays. But right after it’s put on it’s kinda easy for it to bleed. Overall it lasts long and has a sharp finish!
4,Easy to use. Lasts around 5 hours
4,I like it very much.  I can make up my eyes very easy
4,The formula is great I just have a hard time with the brush as it is individual bristles.
4,Daily wear liner but it smudges very easily
4,"Great for value. Easy to apply but brush separates after a little time, making it harder to apply. Stays on long but smudges"
4,"Really liked this eyeliner for the price, and I definitely believe it’s worth it. However it doesn’t stay on very long compared to some of the other eyeliners I use."
4,Works great and is probably my favorite liquid eyeliner at this point
4,"I haven't used makeup in years so keep that in mind. I purchased NYX Epic Ink Liner and NYX Retractable Eyeliner- this is specifically concerning the Ink Liner. I made the mistake of applying the product to my waterline, possibly a rookie mistake but if you're like me- DON'T DO IT. It will go straight onto your eyeball and sit where the lid meets your eye. This liner makes a wicked wing though and has a great flexible pointed tip, product goes on easily (skin) and doesn't seem to run. Smudged when I applied water as a test so just stay dry and you'll be fine."
4,"Great price. Not as black or pigmented as Loreal Lineur Intense,  but a good inexpensive liner for your makeup bag."
4,It’s is an ok eyeliner. Definitely not the best but not the worst at all either.
4,Worked great
4,Smudges easily
4,It goes on very wet so be careful of smudges initially.  But it dries quickly and then stays very well.  Not water proof but resistance is good.
4,"This is a really nice liquid liner that stays put, BUT the tip frayed very quickly. I prefer felt tip liners to avoid the tip fraying, but this one isn’t a bad alternative. Nice dark lines and doesn’t run or smudge!"
4,"Very clean lines, but smudges easily/ not really waterproof"
4,"This product is difficult to get OFF your skin and you'd better get a good line the first time, but it's a nice ink for eyelids if you get it drawn right at the first try."
4,"Despite the brush tip fraying and the cap popping off in my bag, I'm still pretty in love with this product.Great for winged liner."
4,It was easy to apply and stayed on all day. It did not smudge. I will definitely buy this item again.
4,"I have watery eyes, and this product isn't as waterproof as I hoped it would be.  It does go on very easily, has a very good tip.  If you have a great primer and don't have watery eyes, it might work for you."
4,I like this brand a lot. It’s easy to use and has good staying power. Especially for the price
4,"It is very thin and precise, love it."
4,Easy to apply a fine line. Can smudge or rub off. Not completely waterproof.  True black color. Easy to remove.
4,It works well
4,"I love this eyeliner. It is my favorite thus far. It doesn’t smear, stays on even after some accidental eye rubs, and the tip is just great for wings!"
4,It’s brilliant but lasts only for some hours. Easy application. Excellent for beginners.
4,Fine for the proce
4,"Very easy to use,the eyeliner is very precisely,but is not water proof at all."
4,"Looks great on, does smudge, isnt water proof."
4,"It did better than most but I still ended up with 2 black eyes.  I think I'm just done with eye make up because I thought FOR SURE this stuff wouldn't run off my eyes, but it did."
4,I love it but it’s definitely not water proof.
4,Bold looking
4,It’s good
4,Good buy
4,Great 1st application.  Easy to use. You need some kind of power setting. It still smears on me after 10 minutes.
4,this definitely wasnt my shade because it made me look very discolored/olive toned (nothing wrong with being or having either!!) but it was super buttery and smelt good :)
4,"first of all, this smells amazing. comes with a compact underneath to apply easily. pigmented but not heavy, I use it for a light and natural contour, but can also be built up. doesn't irritate my skin at and looks natural."
4,It's okay.
4,"I’ve been using Laura Mercier bronzer & ran out , so  I bought this as a quick fix for a vacation. I have an olive complexion so after a tan this unfortunately doesn’t add any sort of “glow” & in order to achieve that you have to add multiple layers. This unfortunately results in a cakey like texture on your skin (even while using light weight tinted moisturizer) so I don’t think I’ll be using this again.Plus side: smells like coconut butter candy!"
4,Smells good (coconut) and not too pigmented. I have super sensitive skin and haven't had an issue. Nice product for the price.
4,I am not sure if I could see the effects of this product. I have a very fair complexion and it didn’t seem to do much at all.
4,Scent pretty strong coconut or something tropical.
4,"Good bronzer, seems like it would be more pigmented though when applied. Very smooth application."
4,"The scent of this package was like a beachy vacation, it wasn’t awful but not my favorite! But, other than that the package was wrapped in bubble wrap and want cracked/damaged at all! Would definitely recommend!"
4,"I bought this because every beauty influencer talks about it and it was a good price. It's a nice bronzer, but I'm not the biggest fan of the tropical scent."
4,Loved the smell. Looks great on!
4,Really like this product  blends beautifully  feels soft  the scent is a bit strong if your not a fan of coconut/ Shea butter type of smell but other than that its a really pretty bronzer
4,"I would keep buying this just for the smell alone - it’s AMAZING...! I love the color, even on pale skin. Very nice bronzer!"
4,Got recommended from an instagramer and i like it  .  I am pale so it works great and gives me easy light tan color in winter.  I would like it to be just wee bit lighter but over all really nice
4,I say 4* for a few reasons.1. It showed up completely busted the first time even while in bubble wrap and in a bubble mailer.2. The scent while pleasant it kind of strong3. LOVE the texture of it. Very creamy for a powder.4. Very pigmented which is good and bad depending on the brush you use and how you typically apply your makeup. Overall this is a GREAT thing just know it’s pigmented going into using it.
4,Love this product! I got the lighter shade for myself and the darker for a friend. We both love the scent and feel like we just got off the beach when wearing it.
4,Didn't like that it was a cream and not a powder. Smells amazing. Reminds me of paradise.
4,Everything was great a about this product except that it wasn’t very dark. Not much of a bronzer.
4,The color of this bronzer is clearly for a very fair person.  I have tanned skin and it doesn't cut it.  I will keep because I can use it as a base for my blush.  The scent is nice too.
4,I wanted to love this product because of all the good reviews I’ve seen but it looks yellow on my skin tone. I got the shade light to be safe and although I don’t hate it I don’t love it either. It’s an ok affordable bronzer but very subtle.
4,Love the smell
4,"A very nice bronzer for daily use, lovely color. The smell is too strong and artificial. Nice texture and application. Alltogether, a good product for a decent price."
4,Smells good
4,"Well, if you’ve ever tried physicians formula, you know their face products are incredible. They’re so buttery and soft and smooth. They just apply like a dream. The perfume included smells so so good and dreamy. I thought it would smell like cheap coconut perfume but it smells so elegant and like a vacation dream. The only thing is , everything is basically travel sized except for the lipstick which is a pretty, sparkly, tinted, lip balm."
4,"This is a great, warm color for fair skin, but I find that it takes a few swipes before I can put it on.  I like that I can build on the color, and its not overpowering."
4,Scent is strong at first. Very coconut tropical sunscreen. But fades quickly.Good color for pale skin.
4,"Scent is strong, not bad but definitely noticeable. Coverage and color is great"
4,This product is great. It is very scented though. I don’t mind it personally though. But this looked pretty orange on my fair rosy skin. I got the bronze light shade. The regular shade “bronzer” is more neutral and that would’ve probably worked better.
4,Subtle but effective.  I have pale skin and it gives it a glow without looking fake.  You can adjust the look according to your taste.  Suggest a large brush rather than the one included.  Good value for the price.
4,Good for the price
4,It smells like sun tan lotion so that's not ideal. Once I had it on for a bit I couldn't smell it so not a deal breaker. Really like the color and smoothness. Would have been 5 stars if it wasn't for the smell.
4,"I wish that I could use it,  but it turned out to be too dark."
4,"I really like this product because it’s a great dupe for higher end makeup products that you’d find at Sephora or Ulta. This has good color payoff and achieves a bronzed glow without going overboard. It’s also very buildable which I like. I’m only giving this product a 4 out of 5 because I found the scent to be a little overwhelming. Upon first application it had a strong sunscreen smell to it that lingers for a while, but it does make you feel like you’re on vacation to a tropical island, so if that’s your vibe then get this! The sunscreen scent has died down after a while of owning this product, but like I said this is a great drug store dupe to the higher end beauty brands."
4,Beautiful product but feels heavy on my face. I will eventually finish this product but wont repurchase for that reason
4,"Although I did not get the one I ordered, I recieved the ""exclusive edition"" instead, it does seem to be great quality.  I'm not going to return it because I used it before I realized it wasn't the one I wanted.  Not real crazy about the melted butter smell it seems a little strong to me.  But overall a good product."
4,"Product itself is great; however,  it was broken upon arrival"
4,"I like this bronzer... smells really nice, has good color(no sparkle). Only complaint is that it doesn’t seem to last very long. But otherwise I like it so far!"
4,Great bronzer. Gotta get past the ridges a little to get to the good color pigmentation. Great product for the price. Wish it didn't smell though.
4,Was too light on my olive Mediterranean skin. Also strong smell.
4,"Really smooth to blending and Smells pretty nice! Adorable price and excellent product, love it"
4,beautiful brown color.. this is build-able bronze
4,I purchased Sun-Kissed. I would look at this product in person before ordering online.It looks more like a light peach powder on medium skin. And I can see a little shimmer.I could not do any contouring because it is too light.
4,The smell is very strong
4,I love this product but it is not as pigmented as I would like! The smell is everything though! Makes you feel like you’re in Hawaii.
4,"An over decent product, the lightest shade isn’t noticeable on my skin and I’m fair skin toned. I wish I got a shade darker. Smell is very strong of the beach (like a tropical nice scent, just very strong)."
4,I love this product. From the look of the product from the smell. The fragrance will make you feel like you are ready for the beach and have you smiling.  What I would change the sponge that is designed to apply this lovely product. It’s cute but not Beneficial for applying. But that is not going to help me from buying this product again.  I love it!
4,"Smells so good. Not really highly pigmented which I like so I am in control & can build it up. Goes on smoothly, like butter! Warms the face very nicely. It lasts a long time also which is great."
4,"I have seen this bronzer on so many YouTube makeup tutorials that I wanted to give it a try. I ordered the light shade thinking that it would be dark enough for me because I am pretty fair. I should have ordered the deep shade in order to do a soft contour. I gave this four stars because it is a good soft bronzer for fair skin. I will use it on ""no makeup/makeup"" days just to give my face some color. It is such a buttery formula with the slight scent of coconut that I personally love. If you don't like scents in your products, then this isn't for you."
4,On my fair skin this was more of an orange color instead of the mocha brown. Anyone else experience this?
4,Love this stuff!  ❤️
4,"IF YOU'RE WANTING A DEEP BRONZER FOR A DEEP SKIN TONE,THIS IS NOT IT...This is deeper than the original,but nowhere near dark enough for dark ethnic skin tones.It smells good and I will keep it be use as a light contour powder or transition shade for eyeshadow looks If you're darker than a nc42,this will not show as a contour."
4,"Not very highly pigmented. The smell is a little strong. If you're the type who is used to higher end highly pigmented waterproof products then this may disappoint. I don't usually wear bronzer so I don't have much to compare it to, but my other makeup is all high pigment waterproof last all day stuff and I can tell the difference in quality. This stuff is ok for me, for now. I will probably seek out something with more pigment later during the summer when I sweat more. I don't expect this to last long when I'm outdoors in summer. Also, the applicator is like an odd little flat silicone wedge. I'm not super thrilled with that. I think this may work better if I use a makeup sponge and bounce it on my face in layers. Its also not as glowy as I was hoping. It looks more like a tan powder foundation vs ""dewy glow"". So it depends on what type of look you're going for."
4,Smells so good I want to eat it. Packaging is cute and tropical. Comes with a little sponge brush that doesn't blend very well so I recommend using your own brush. Pigmented and looks really nice and shimmery.  Again I want to emphasize how much I love the smell. Sometimes I uncap it just to smell it lol
4,This product is a very light bronzer. It is great for light or pale skin because it warms up the complexion just enough without looking like a fake tan. It's natural and a sun kissed glow like the package says. Very affordable price.
4,"I really wanted to like this bronzer but I don’t think I will be buying it again. I really like the color and it looks natural rather than orangey. As long as you don’t use the brush that comes with it and use a fan brush instead, you do get a natural look. The one thing that bothers me the most about this product is that it has talc. Talc is dangerous if inhaled. The company should work on eliminating this ingredient from their products. This is the reason I removed a star.  I try to hold my breath as I apply it but I don’t think I will be buying it again because of the talc. I will keep looking for an alternate option."
4,Smells really nice at first. I go through it really fast unfortunately. Very good bronzer for a warm glow. I managed to get it for less than $5 here on a sale. I would recommend to wait until the price drops to less than $10. Amazing deal.
4,Smells great and goes on smooth. It doesn’t last all day. Will need touch ups.
4,"I was trying to find a bronzer to replace my Bonne bell gel bronzer so I scoured Amazon to find anything similar. While this is not gel format, it has a bit of a creamy finish. I chose the darkest shade so it has a very tanned glow. A few people complemented my ""tan"" so I am satisfied. It smells delicious too by the way! Would buy again."
4,i adore the butter bronzer....the wonderful coconut/tropical scent is why i wouldn't ever change brands. the coloring is nice too on these though! don't really do that annoying thing where as it wears throughout the day and your skin gets oily...it turns kinda orangey. this doesn't really do that. which i like.
4,I’m fair skinned and even this was to light for me.  I’d get dark
4,I just can’t seem to get this to blend like my other bronzers.
4,Smells great
4,I love this bronzer..you can apply it in layers for a light touch of color or reapply for a darker bronze..
4,Decent product but the foam brush is great for applying but not blending
4,it smells like coconut not sure if i love it
4,Really like this shade & it lasted all day. You're supposed to be able to apply it with a brush or sponge. I used a brush over BB cream & it came out streaky. It will probably work better with a sponge. I don't know if the compact itself is supposed to have a seal. Mine did not.
4,"Smells good, looks nice"
4,Good for the price.
4,Very pleasant scent for me. Blends well.
4,It smells like tanning oil but if you leave the lid cracked a couple of days it becomes less strong. The color blends pretty nicely!
4,"Great product, great color, great application. LOW staying power, needed to reapply every 3 hours on top of longwear foundation and primer and beneath setting spray"
4,Love this though my only complaint it smells like microwave popcorn. You don’t notice the smell when it’s on.
4,The color is too heavy and the taste is too strong. NOT GOOD FOR ME
4,"Nice bronzer, creamy and dark"
4,Overall a good quality bronzer.  Not amazing or spectacular.  Smells amazing though.
4,"It is a perfect bronzer. The only thing why I gave 4 stars is because of the scent, which is a bit strong for me. Otherwise its perfect"
4,The texture on this bronzer is great feels super soft and goes on really great. Drawback is it's a little too orange for me (I just go super light handed on application) and it doesn't wear that long needs touch ups.
4,"Silky powder, not dusty or flaky.  Goes on smooth. Nice case with a mirror and applicator.  Color could have been a little darker."
4,This product smells so good and the package is just beautiful.  The only problem I have is that it does have a lot of powder fly always.
4,Needs more colors. The ones offered are a bit too orange for my skin tone. Smells so good.
4,I love this bronzer a little lighter then expected
4,"good color, good quality"
4,"This is a really great formula and it blends very nicely. It smells INCREDIBLE and doesn't irritate my sensitive combination skin. The only thing I dislike about this is that when I have dry patches (which I often get on my forehead), it tends to accentuate my dryness. Other than that, it's perfect!"
4,"Got this for a steal on prime day! I love the quality of the product and it looks and feels great on the skin. It smells strongly of sunscreen, which I really dislike but probably wouldn't bother others. All in all, glad I bought it."
4,Smells really tropical. Compact is very handy. Definitely would buy this brand again.
4,Feels very light on my face.  Color is great
4,"I bought it because it's popular and good reviews from the beauty bloggers and YouTubers. I have fair to medium skin tone, therefore I choose the original one. I think the color is natural on my face. And maybe it's too natural that I can't really tell if it has the effect. But it may also because my skill or the way I put it on. So I am still using it every day.Some good part about the product:1. The performance is very natural, easy for newbie to use.2. The scent is pleasent for me and the package is sturdy (I didn't know it comes with built in mirror)Some parts can be improved:1. I totally have no idea about the usage of the green sponge come with it.2. It's too natural, it's hard to tell if it's still on my face or not."
4,Love the summer glow it gives me.  Just a small amount is needs !!
4,Great product and smells wonderful. Only issue is the packaging is broken and can’t close :(
4,"Smalls amazing, and I like how it glides on.  I just like NARS better."
4,"It smells like suntan lotion, which is not bad. The brozer is beautiful! Lots of fall out but still great!"
4,"I liked the feel of this product but I bought one that was to light for my medium olive tone skin with warm undertones. It pretty much blended in with the color of my skin,"
4,"I'm new to bronzers, so I'm not sure whether all bronzers are like this but it has a very orange look to it. My skin tone is light and if I apply too much it looks like I have dirt on my face. With the write technique, it gives me a very nice tan and it also smells amazing."
4,"Smells great, not a lot of pigment once applied"
4,"I love it! Blends beautifully and makes the skin look so healthy. It has a little bit of shimmer, but it’s not annoying like other bronzers with shimmer. Smells pretty nice too :)"
4,"This bronzer is more of a cream, and they include a sponge applicator than a brush. I was a little leery of that, but actually, it goes on very well and smooth. It's not over the top, but does apply some color. The scent of it is really nice - really like this! I have a feeling it's going to last a long time too."
4,Love the bronzer. Only problem was the case was broken when I received it but the product itself is great. Very pretty and smells tropical.
4,"cute packaging - apply with a damp sponge for a smooth base - it smells like coconut, ugh"
4,I like this. It smells like food and isn’t shiny
4,"Nice value bronzer. Natural (read: not orange) color. Smooth and silky texture. My only complaint is the scent. It is highly fragranced for makeup. If you've ever smelled that sweet,thick,coconut fragrance that is pumped into the air at Treasure Island and Mirage in Las Vegas -- that is what this smells like."
4,"I really like the container/box it comes in. It is easy to hold. It also comes with an applicator (which sucks) and a mirror.The consistency is a mix between powdery and creamy. It applies evenly. I just wished it was a bit darker. I am a white-skinned woman and I stay away from the sun. I had to apply A LOT to see the sun-kissed effect. Other than that, I really like it and will purchase again."
4,"I love this bronzer it's the perfect color and smells amazing! The only problem I had it that it was super powdery so there was a lot of kickback. I accidentally dropped it and it made a huge mess in the pan. Fortunately I was able to fix it with a some rubbing alcohol and pressed it back together, now it's much less powdery. I'm still using it and I like it much better now that I pressed it back together, the fallout this isn't an issue."
4,"Omg first off, this smells amazing. The smell reminds me of the beach, summertime and sunscreen. I’m somewhat fair but not extremely fair (NC25) So it’s hard to find a perfect shade for me because they typically tend to run too dark and too orange! However, this is a great shade against my skin tone. Very natural looking. I use it for contouring and I absolutely love it. To boot, amazon has it for the best price! Highly recommend!"
4,"I've been using more and more Physician's Formula items as they seem to not aggravate allergy problems I have. They don't cause my eyes to burn or nose to itch like so many other make products. This bronzer is the same, it doesn't feel heavy or overly powdery when it goes on and the color turned out better than I expected. The only complaint I have is the delivery, when it arrived it was in a box (not bubble wrapped or anything) with other items. During the delivery process the pressed powder broke and bronzer powder got all over the other item and now the bronzer is in pieces. Luckily nothing was ruined beyond repair or use and that's the chance you take when buying pressed powders online. Other than that, the product itself is wonderful."
4,"Kinda small but I love the packaging and love the sent! Great product overall. Just enough pigmentation, nothing too crazy!"
4,"This stuff looks great on my skin! The only thing is, if you're brown, definitely get the next color up because it doesn't really show unless you layer it a lot. Stars off because i reallly don't like the smell (smells like FAKE coconuts to this Island Girl) so I won't be repurchasing."
4,"Ok, this bronzer is nice. The scent is very nice. It is ok as a bronzer. I would imagine it should probably last a long time, depending on how often you use it."
4,Good!!
4,Great neutral/ slightly warm bronzer for fair skin.
4,"Works very well and a nice color, but it smells like coconut which is kind of weird and it will leave your makeup brushes smelling like coconut."
4,I'm a make up newbie but I love this bronzer. It's just the right shade for me. It does have quite a strong coconut smell and when I first used it it was pretty overpowering. As I have used it more I still notice the small when I'm putting it on but not after its on. It's cheaper here on Amazon than in store so worth a try!
4,"People raved about the smell, I think its only ok. Blends nicely, color looks natural on my fair skin tone. I would by again."
4,It smells amazing. But little product. My wet n wild bronzer ticket to Brazil had more product than it.
4,The smell is amazing! Smells and looks like you have been kissed by the sun.
4,Love this bronzer!
4,great product! but broke after a couple uses (i didn't drop it or anything)
4,Nice texture and scent. I wish they had a little more pigment.
4,"Smells so good! Unfortunately, I ordered the shade Bronzer, which was basically the same color as my skin. Will have to pick up a different shade. The compact has a mirror and a sponge applicator all in one, however, this makes it quite bulky. Mirror is great, didn't use the sponge applicator."
4,"I love this bronzer! It's very creamy and blends well. It's really hard to get a bronzer that is okay with my almost-neutral skin tone. Most of them make me look like a dirty potato. This does not make me look dirty, I look smooth and natural. The included poof even works pretty well. It's definitely great for warming up my slightly-too-pale foundations. Blends easily into cream foundations with or without bake, which is impressive!On the other hand, the scent is VERY strong. It smells good but gives me a crazy headache."
4,Great product ...but was broken like everyone elses🤨
4,"I dropped this the same day that I got it, so unfortunately couldn't use it long, but I've heard really great reviews on it and it did feel nice on the skin."
4,Amazing! Very soft and slightly creamy. Lovely smell and a very little amount goes a long way!
4,Great but I prefer a more noticeable bronze still nice
4,Very good bronzer. Smells good to
4,"Formula is good and smooth . Smells delicious!It doesn’t give that much color , I’m fair skinned and I feel like even for me it’s light. . I usually use Hoola which is my favorite ! And still is but I was trying to find something decent for a better price - I’d say it’s good not great..."
4,"Great to cover my freckles, but this color looks a little dark. Can use to make shadows. Gave to my friend and I need buy a lighter one"
4,"I love this bronzer. Its silky and I use my own brush, I dont think I would like the applicator that comes with it."
4,I hate the smell of it. Everyone says it smells like coconuts or the beach. I strongly disagree. But it's a nice bronzer it's a little too light on me so i mix it with my hoola bronzer (which is to dark on me)
4,The product does not spread on my skin as much as I would like it to.
4,"Mine broke, but I still use it because its a great bronzer. It gives a beautiful glow."
4,"It smells amazing, but I prefer my Benefit Hula bronzer. This one isn't super pigmented I don't think, I had to keep going back to dip my brush in. Blends ok. I got the Sunkissed color, maybe the darker one is better."
4,"I purchased the ""bronzer."". It isn't muddy colored like some bronzers and does look natural. While I can appreciate a pleasant scent, the pineapple or whatever it is, isn't what i want in a bronzer. If you don't like a scent then stay away from this. Overall good color but too aromatic."
4,This smells amazing! Like your on a tropical beach. I like this product overall. Not too dark not too light. No shimmer which I like.
4,"I love this bronzer. It's not too orange for me and blends very naturally. However, the smell is very strong, so it may not be for everyone. I feel like I can still smell it on my face when I'm leaving the house."
4,The applicator is not useful for me (hence 4 stars) but it is a GREAT product!!!
4,"Product is okay, a little dark on my face, I am lite skin, I probably would buy a lighter color. If you have lighter skin, get a lighter color."
4,The product itself is beautiful but the smell is a bit strong.
4,"While this was a little lighter than I would have liked, you can layer it and get the desired effect. Let me tell you this, it smells so good. If you are into the beachy sort of scents, you will love the smell. I have pretty sensitive skin and this does not irritate it in the least. Love!"
4,nice
4,Works as advertised and has a great coconut scent.  Much less expensive than other bronzers.
4,"I love the unique texture and pigmentation of the bronzer! The pan size is great, and a little goes a long way. I use this with a fluffy contour brush and I get almost instant results. However, my only complaint is that the scent is way too strong."
4,"I love the smell, very smooth on the skin but turns out lighter than expected. Barely visible."
4,lighter than i expected but worked out great for me
4,"If I purchase this bronzer in the future I may go a shade down. With this, I can achieve a subtle glow and it smells lovely. It builds alright, but it does fade slightly throughout the day."
4,smells amazing but the color is SO light on me. I'm a MAC nc20/25 for reference.
4,Great bronzer for pale skin!
4,"The bronzer color is a bit warmer than what I was used to but I am enjoying it now, especially over the summer.  It is very smooth and bendable and has a great natural sheen to it."
4,Has a really nice scent. I wouldn't call this a 'bronzer' though. It's a nice smooth silky powder.
4,I wish it were a little darker. I am light skinned. Smells great.
4,Product is great but smells like something very cheap and it is annoying.
4,Really great bronzer. It goes on smooth and lasts a long time. It has a strong Pina Colada scent.
4,This product smells amazing!!!!  I have to be careful not to use too much because it smells so good I keep dipping into the pan. The bronzer color is good. I't slightly too warm for me so other products do a better job at contouring. But this is really nice as a bronzer.
4,"I love this Butter Bronzer!  Smells so good, but not overpowering.  The color is good for fair skin and the formulation is soft, but not powdery.  Giving four stars because of the bulky packaging."
4,I ADORE this product. It smells so so so good and the color applies well. I have typical Indian brown skin and it shows up. Although if you're darker than the average I doubt this will show up. I definitely did not expect the slightly red clay like tones in it but its perfect. (Tip for a sunny day? Use it like a blush with a light hand for a really neat look.)
4,I love this product but the shade selection is ridiculous. I’m pretty fair and the new darkest shade works perfectly for me. I guess poc weren’t thought about when making the shade range but ok.
4,"I like it but I'm not in love. It's a good, build able bonzer but definitely not as much color payoff as expected. Also, not a fan of the scent, it doesn't need it."
4,Love this! Wish it was a bit more brown as it pulls a tad orange on me but it’s wearable.
4,"Butter bronzer is smooth and easy to apply. For more product, get a less dense fluffy brush. If you like a natural look, I use an ecotools dense fluffy powder brush and it looks great. Tons of product- have not hit pan and I use it daily."
4,My absolute favorite drugstore bronzer!
4,"This bronzer is very pretty and natural. I love it so much and whenever I wear it, it gives the prettiest healthy glow. The only thing is that I have a light to medium skin tone and it only shows up when I am very light and not at all when I am tan. I would suggest getting a darker shade if you are even the slightest bit tan. Plus the scent it has is so amazing I just want to smell it 24/7. If you are someone that doesn't like heavily scented products, don't worry you can't smell it when it is on your face."
4,"This actually stands up to the hype. It smells subtle and applies smooth. This blends like a dream and doesnt get patchy. My only complaint is the bulky packaging, but that is minor."
4,"I'm, pretty fair, not quite ivory but close, so I bought the light. Doesn't show up on my skin at all.  Will be ordering the regular bronze shade in hopes it will give me some color. Product is very silky and smells like summer."
4,"The product color is nice.  It blends well.  It could be a little more creamy.  The applicator doesn't work worth a dang!  I have to squeeze and tap, and whatever else, to get the product out of the bottle!  Annoying.  But still ok."
4,This product is ok. Have to push on face pretty hard to get it to work
4,This DOES NOT work under the eyes too well as it smears and looks valet because it super thick. As a spot coverup it’s my favorite. I use it to cover dark spots around my eyes but stopped using it under my eyes or around my mouth where it creases as this has ZERO staying power if in very mobile parts of your face likes under eyes or around mouth. I’d recommend as a cheap alternative but not for under eye area it’s too thick
4,"I'm in the cosmetic business and should have known better. The applicator looked easy to use, However I'm used to using better products. You get what you pay for. It's to drying for under the eyes and to thick. YSL touche clau is the best one in the industry"
4,I wish I could remove the applicator and just use a concealer brush to apply. The sponge is huge and leaves a stippled effect that is hard to blend. I can’t even tell if the product is any good because I can barely get it on where it needs to go (inner corner of eyes and over dark circles).
4,Product is good but was delivered to wrong address good thing my neighbor gave it to me.
4,"I like that it's very handy and compact to keep in your purse , or for travel."
4,"I am an older male with medium skin and I bought this to cover up surgery scars on the side of my face from Melanona.  Works great as far as I’m concerned.  Covers well, blends in with my skin tone and is not greasy.  Washes off with soap at the end of the day.  Sure it would work well on acne scars or other stuff."
4,"I have a pale pink skin, and I couldn't find a concealer that didn't look yellow on my skin to save my life. (Yes, even so-called ""cool tone"" shades look yellow on me.) This stuff actually matches my face shade pretty well. I know it's meant to be a brightening cream, but this is my go-to concealer now.However, I ripped off the silly little sponge applicator part. It just gets super dirty after one use and it doesn't apply the product smoothly. I'd rather use my fingers. The twist up feature makes it hard to dispense the product without getting too much or too little. I'm going to keep buying this anyway until I find a better alternative."
4,very easy to use..i didn't have reaction on my sensitive skin...
4,It’s ok. Didn’t cover my two little age spots. But it would work well for you lighter discolouration a I suppose.
4,"Spreads easily, covers every nook and blends well"
4,Been using this for years. Covers perfectly and is easy to apply either sponge tip
4,"While I find it is a pretty good under-eye concealer, I don't like the 'sticky' residue at the cap."
4,Easy to apply and convenient
4,"No longevity. This product goes on really well. I bought the neutralizer and it worked perfectly on my dark circles. However, after trying Several different application procedures, I could not get this to stay on for most of the day. It was absorbed right back in to my skin"
4,Easy to apply.
4,"This seems to work - I think it would work better if the color I got was a little different. Fortunately, it’s so inexpensive, I’m going to buy a couple of others and see if I can get a perfect match."
4,Perfect!
4,I like the application took but not necessarily the coverage it supplies
4,Satisfied with the performance. Not bad for the price.
4,She likes it.
4,Love the sponge end that makes it easy to spread. It’s not super moisturizing but don’t dry you out.
4,Easy to apply but doesn’t last throughout the day.
4,"I found this to work fairly well, for the price point, but the ease of spreading was not quite to my liking. It was thick and dried fast. Be sure to apply to one small area at a time and use a moistened beauty blender to work it in to level of desired coverage."
4,Love it! Great coverage and easy to apply!
4,"I like the product overall. It’s quite easy to spread and stays sheer. However, I have very dry skin so it’s not as moisturizing as I’d like so I need to prime my under eye area really well."
4,"This product does the “click” turn to move the makeup to the top. Thus, rendering the amount inside very low. But, overall good coverage."
4,"Light coverage, perfect for someone looking for a touch of color."
4,"I normally use a Garnier under eye concealer, but it has gotten really pricey. This Maybelline under eye concealer was half the price and had great reviews. I give it a 9.5 out of 10 compared to the Garnier. The Garnier goes on like silk and blends in slightly better. The Maybelline is a bit more milky looking; it just doesn't blend in quite as well. However, for the price I will use the Maybelline for everyday and the Garnier for special occasions."
4,Favorite concealer I've tried as far as the feel goes. It's so creamy. I took off one star because even the lightest color is too dark.
4,Great concealer. Smooth light and good quality like a $25 brand. The brightener has got a pinkish tone. I put my regular color “light honey” on top of it.
4,"It’s light coverage for what I need it for and easy to use, I will be ordering this again"
4,Good product. Applicator is well made and coverage is good for a few hours. Wears off throughout the day in my opinion.
4,This make up lasts a long time and is an easy to use highlighter. I put it on under my eyes after applying my normal color foundation and it gives a nice glowy look. I wouldn’t say it’s a miracle worker like other reviews say but it does a great deal to hide my dark circles. Makes a noticeable difference.
4,Much better than the last one I like the shade and texture
4,Covers better than anything else I have ordered so far.
4,"The concealer is good, but just hard to get it out. I took the advice of removing the sponge tip.Holding it upright, you twist the top, and it pushes the concealer out. But be CAREFUL, cuz it will rush out in excess."
4,"There is easy application with this product since it comes with a system where you twist the top and then product comes out through the sponge on the top. However, I do think that this product is a little hard to clean for those of us who worry about bacteria accumulating in our makeup (which can lead to breakouts). However since I am applying mostly near my eyes where I never experience acne, I do not think it is a huge deal.There is great coverage and the concealer can last nearly all day, even when you are hot and sweaty!"
4,I find it more for dark circles under the eyes. Wouldn't really say age rewind as that portion has done nothing. But it applys very nice. I will buy again.
4,Works very well as smooth cover up
4,Easy to apply and doesn’t have to get all over your hands. i use it for “no makeup” days when you want to spot treat certain areas. It easily fits well in a purse makeup bag for quick touch ups (especially good when face masks or sweating take away your fresh look)
4,"The sponge was also a little big to use but other than that, it was good."
4,Wife: I bought for myself because of good reviews.  Does a good job covering up imperfections but it leaves flaky specs on my face. It's definitely not for people with dry skin. It's not moisturizing at all.  It has a sticky texture while you are apply it to your face.
4,"While the initial coverage this product provided for old acne scar discoloration was ok, the thing I find most appealing is that after 10 hours of having it on my skin is still completely covered. I can't believe I never heard of this product before. I've been spending a fortune on Estee Lauder coverage for dark spots and for six to seven dollars this beats it hands down. I am fair-skinned blond and I bought the 115 which worked for me but you might want to go to shade120 if your dark spots are more visible."
4,Mine is a little light but I like the makeup but the blender on the top doesn’t work good
4,The product was easy to spread. I had to combine foundation to make the color fit my face.
4,It is easy to spread & sheer!!
4,"Had a little trouble getting the concealer to start, but after the sponge was a bit saturated, it worked pretty well"
4,Easy to spread
4,Easy to use but wish it cover dark circles better
4,I like this cover up. It goes on very smooth. I only wish it canceled more. It takes more than I would have expected
4,I’m dark skinned and it works nice for concealing but it’s hard to get out. I felt like I was twisting forever until I saw product but it’s perfect otherwise
4,This stuff works great’ I use it around my eyes. I have allergies and my eyes have them the worst. This brightens me right up.I use bare minerals around the rest of my fave they go togynicely.
4,The coverage is nice and all but it uses up really fast.
4,I like this product easy to apply
4,Easy to use.  Matches my skin color.
4,"It is easy to spread, moisturizing, but not sheer"
4,Great concealer. The sponge applicator falls apart but the make up is good
4,I’m Puerto Rican so alittle dark and this is most likely made for Caucasian skin hard to blend and look natural even just under my eyes just to light for my skin other than that good product
4,Good and easy to blend however is not good for all day.
4,"This is a great concealer. Coverage is very nice, perfect for blemishes and under eyes. Blend well with a dampened sponge and viola!"
4,"I really love the delivery method for this foundation but lets be real, if you're old you are old... there is no magic paint in a bottle to erase 20 years.  It covers well, it looks natural and well its paint for your face."
4,Very creamy and the sponge applicator made it easy to apply.  I was shocked to learn that I picked the right color without being able to see them.  I would highly recommend this product
4,Honestly the reviews on YouTube were so high for this but it really doesn’t cover my dark circles that well. It’s a nice creamy texture and easy to blend but I find myself only using it for brightness and using the FitMe concealer to cover dark circles
4,"This is a nice eraser. The color fits me well, and it can cover over 80% of the stains. But it's a little dry for my skin."
4,"It works well enough, but is quite sheer so multiple layers are needed. Though, it layers well."
4,"This is by far the best concealer I have ever used. It goes on smoothly, doesn't crease, and covers beautifully. I got two shades -- Fair and Pale. Fair is perfect for my skin tone as a concealer, and I'm using the Pale for contouring. I took away one star because the sponge applicator is messy and simply not adequate, especially for the under eye area. I need to rush and smooth out the concealer with a brush and my fingertips before it dries. Other than that, I love the product!"
4,Easy and so convenient to take & apply on the go I haven’t found the exact color match yet though.
4,It works as a concealer but makes my face look cakey. It's an okay product but a little too heavy and dry
4,Loves this
4,It had good coverage. I guess I found it to be a little thin. Hard to explain. The applicator is nice though
4,"Its pretty good. Had to soak in warm water because it gets hard, but overall pretty good."
4,"Not a huge fan of this applicator because it makes it hard to blend since when you try to, more concealer comes out.. so I just pat it on and blend with my fingers. However, it does match my skin tone which is hard for me, being I’m so fair skinned, so I was very happy with that. The consistency is light, but it doesn’t take much to look cakey, so in other works “a little goes a long way”. It’s definitely a good product if you’re on a low budget."
4,Wish it was a bit more opaque
4,Not the most coverage but overall a pretty good product especially for the price.
4,This is my third purchase. It is great coverage and doesn’t crease.
4,"Good coverage, goes on smoothly. I thought the shade I ordered would be too dark but it's actually perfect. Blends well. Good to use if you're on the go and don't need a full face of makeup."
4,"I love this concealer!! It's now what I'm going to continue to use. It works so well, sometimes I forget to put on the rest of my makeup 💄"
4,"I’m 84 years old and have been needing a good ‘cover’ under my eyes for a long time. Thanks, Maybelline  Instant Age Rewind you helped me a lot."
4,Does a good job of getting rid of fine facial hair and helps to remove dead skin. A little hard to maneuver around the eyes because it’s a straight blade.
4,Works well easy and convenient
4,Haven’t decided if this was a good idea because now the new growth hair sticks straight out and I sometimes don’t notice it.  They are scratchy and a bit rough.
4,"I dont think its for sensitive skin because the blades are pretty sharp, but if you move it at a place where its not sharp it can work."
4,Works really well even on my super sensitive skin. I’ve even used it on my arms and it works great. I do feel like after just 4-5 uses I could tell it started to dull because it felt a little more rough on my skin. Overall I will still continue to use it
4,Great for sensitive skin !
4,Arrived as described. Careful using the product..the blades are super sharp. While your eyebrows will look great they will cut your skin and leave you feeling like you have razor burn 😅 I don’t recommend for sensitive skin
4,Used this product throught the pandemic. Saved lot of dollars on threading my eyebrows..
4,Super easy to use and gets the job done.
4,I wish these came with good directions in case there’s an optimal way to use them. One little razor lasts a maybe 4 dermaplanes.
4,Work well and last a while
4,"I like them but they don’t last too long, good for a couple use, so I wouldn’t stock up, nice for what I’d pay"
4,These work great just gotta be careful with sensitive skin as they leave bumps occasionally.
4,Doing it yourself is much cheaper than going in for derma-planing. It's cheap but works well. Doesn't last more than 2-3 times but cheap enough to buy more.
4,"Works good. I have super sensitive skin, so my only real complaint is after dermaplaning my skin is red and blotchy for a few hours"
4,My skin was smooth after using one. It takes some getting used to. I have to adjust angles depending on what hand I am using or what area I am doing. I haven't cut myself but I can see how it is possible. I will keep working on it. I probably would buy again.
4,Trying these out. They are a tad bit sharper than the tinkle razors I usually get. Or maybe because the blade is longer. I’ve seemed to nick myself a lot easier with these. But still do the job. Just be mindful and careful how you use
4,"These are...fine. Nothing life-changing. Some hair take a few tries to get, but they’re nice for cleaning up around eyebrows. Might not be good for dry skin - I had a lot of flaking afterwards."
4,Pretty neat.
4,Longer than expected which will make it difficult to shave my eyebrows but I still like it and it still does what I need it to
4,I use these to shave no complaints
4,"The only reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 was that it took some learning to understand how to use the tool properly (and not cut myself!). After learning how to use it, it was really easy to remove unwanted hair."
4,"I would not throw the tweezers away, but this does make the eyebrows a little faster to do. I am older so I am sure that skin elasticity is a factor and I may get better with it. It is not something I am ready to use exclusively, but I will use it in conjunction with my tweezers and see if they become less necessary. I would buy them again though."
4,"I started using these to clean up my eyebrows. This is definitely way faster and easier than plucking. However, it doesn’t last nearly as long. As long as you’re willing to keep up with it at least once a week, then I would recommend these."
4,This product is super easy to use and great for what its intended to do trim or get rid of little hairs. My only issue is that you need to be a bit careful its much sharper than it looks and will irritate a tiny bit without you even noticing it. Overall good product and price👍
4,They work as described. I have sensitive dry skin and there have been no negative reactions.
4,"Does what it is supposed to do! Got rid of facial hair and some dead skin, super satisfying. Can scrape your skin if you're too rough, but not dangerous."
4,It's easy to use and everything but I suggest putting on an oil beforehand or lotion thoroughly.
4,No issues so for good item.
4,"It's a pretty straightforward basic razor. I use it for shaping the brows. I wish it would stay sharp longer, but I can get a decent amount of uses from it."
4,"I love the sgeath which covers the razors. It's super easy to hold. It doesn't remove hair doen to the skin like a safety razor, which is why I gave it 4 stars. But it's so easy to maneuver around eyebrows. Plus, the multipack is a good deal."
4,"Decent for the price, single use, easy to hold and just got the job done.I used these for dermaplaning my face(removing dead skin and peace fuzz) I followed basic directions online and these got the job done. I have acne and oily skin, it didn’t damage my skin and afterwards my skin looked and felt so much better. I will buy this again."
4,I use these to remove the peach fuzz from my face and they work great. I usually get about two uses out of each shaver after cleaning with alcohol between uses.
4,Wish I would have started using sooner
4,"These are very easy to use, but no matter how much moisturizer I use beforehand, it always makes my skin flake. Sometimes the “blades” will get caught, but it does the job."
4,"Not a bad little tool. Besides eyebrows/hair, it exfoliates and I have super dry skin so it does a great job at removing the dry skin."
4,I love these little razors. Compact and easy to store and travel with. For years I used the creams and got rashes and redness. I always heard that women shouldn't shave their faces. Wrong! The hair does not grow back faster and thicker. With these razors my makeup looks better. The also exfoliate and make my skin look and feel softer. Wish I knew about this a long time ago.
4,Replacement for electric one.  Works great.
4,effective and durable. if only there was a more enviornmently sustainable option for hairyy gurls. it's also fairly expensive for 3. but gots to use it soo good.
4,Easy to use. Have used for a variety of projects. Will buy again.
4,There are easy to hold not really for sensitive skin
4,"These are great to use but do not last long, razor gets dull pretty quickly (after 1-2 uses)"
4,At first I loved how smooth my skin looked after shaving! Then fast forward 2 months later and now my skin breaks out. I never had issues with acne in my life until I started shaving my face. Never again. This would be good for a quick eyebrow day. So now I’m just trying to get my old skin back.
4,"After trimming your eyebrows, it's nice to draw them with an eyebrow pencil."
4,"I've been ""shaving"" my face for a couple years now with the FlawlessTouch mini razor however it wasn't getting my face as smooth as it used to. I decided to give these a try. I'm not sure I love them but they are good. They get a close shave and are easy to hold and use. The big downside is that the end of the razor and the plastic are really rough and it scratch me in several places. It didn't cut, it scratched like taking a stick and running it across your skin. I feel if the ends were shaped differently, they would be much better. I did get a little razor burn under my nose. I probably should have used the cap on it there. I didn't like them for my eyebrows.. I feel these are too big to get the eyebrow area well. A small/shorter blade would be better. Even with the cap on these. It was too long to get a good angle. Also, be careful going over moles. It hurts."
4,At first I didn't know what to do but I like them to remove fuzzy hair on face. I'm having a little trouble around brows but overall I like them.
4,The eyebrow trimming knife has a good effect on eyebrow trimming. The sharpness is just right for eyebrow trimming.
4,Good product.
4,"I have sensitive skin so I was hesitant to try these on my face and have red spots all over. My first use, I didn’t use water, soap, or anything really. Just glided it dry, and it worked great. Lots of peach fuzz type hair came off and I didn’t have any irritation. Then I wanted to see how it would do with soap and water. This time, I broke out in red spots. So I’d try without anything on your first try. And skip the soapy water if it works. I’m still trying to get rid of those razor bumps."
4,Good 1st time. Second scratchy
4,Very sharp so be careful but great for dermaplaning!!
4,I enjoy using this product
4,This product is great for beginners. It’s fairly easy to use and does remove all the “peach fuzz” from unwanted areas. You have to be extremely careful so as not to cut yourself though and moisturizing afterward is a must.
4,"Its like shaving. I don't know why I expected something more when it's essentially a razor. I will say it gets a close shave, BUT it IS a shave. Don't use this on places you wouldn't normally shave! Buzzfeed advertised it with someone who shaved all their peach-fuzz off. WHY??? You're going to have to continue to shave that place (their face) now! The hair will grow back (obviously). The razor is delicate enough to be used on delicate places, so if you already shave those places, go for it."
4,These work well to dermaplain my face but be gentle because they are sharp.
4,"I’ve only been “dermaplaning” for a couple of years.  I had previously used what I found at beauty supply stores. Since the pandemic, I’ve been ordering from Amazon and found these and they are the best that I’ve found so far. It takes off more peach fuzz and dead skin than the other shavers that I’ve used. Sterilizing with alcohol before and after use is very important. After use, my face looks brighter and is definitely smoother.  After dermaplaning, I use a hydrating serum and moisturizer. I don’t use a toner or astringent.  Overall my skin looks healthier and even a bit younger!"
4,"Very sharp be careful! Need to be cleaned after every use, but great product for price!"
4,"Well, maybe its me, but this really scratch at my skin. Had to run it over several times to get hair off!"
4,Great razor!! Does the job. Great price
4,Great tool for a dermaplane. Easy to use.  Read the directions so you don't use chemicals that cause sensitivity afterwards.
4,I definitely was skeptical to buy these but I have no complaints. There are cute and perfect for my skin. They were a little rough at first but I think it was user error😂.
4,"I hadn't seen these in years, glad to find them again. Like having on hand for quick use when needed."
4,Was so excited to get them but they def irritated my skin n I didn’t even go right on top of the skin thankfully
4,"Great product. However, ordered 2 packs and only received 1."
4,Easy to use and so soft!
4,Won't cut you but if pressed down to hard will leave razor burn. Other than that it works great I use it for lip hair and eyebrows
4,Nice product. Easy to use.
4,"Very addicting let me tell you, too easy to use. Be careful they are very sharp. Definitely described correctly."
4,Better than expected. Worked better than the brand I had been using (pink and white handles). These are very sharp.
4,"Edit:I ended up purchasing the flawless razor my clients raved about but was severely disappointed by its performance. I followed the instructions to a tee, replaced the battery, still didn’t get the hairs. So I’m altering my review & adding a star because these are cheaper & did a closer shave.Original:I bought this product hoping for a razor that is smaller for smaller areas to shave, such as between my eyebrows, as well as hoping for a closer shave on those pesky dark hairs on my chin (thank you kindly to my 2 children & hitting my 30s for contributing). While it is smaller, it kind of stops there. When I use it to shave my face, it tears up my skin - not in a good way. As a medical aesthetician, I would not recommend using this for dermaplaning, as I'm quite certain this is actively causing more damage. A few of my clients have recently mentioned using the Nu Flawless razor to get a closer shave between laser hair removal treatments, so I would recommend looking into that instead. It might cost more, but from what I have observed with my clients, it is worth the money."
4,"Works well for peach fuzz on my face and rogue neck hairs. It is a little hard to use around my eyebrows, which is what I wanted it for."
4,"This definitely does what its supposed to. As a woman with PCOS, I have some facial peach fuzz and a somewhat darker mustache to maintain, and THIS WORKS. The one downside, is using it on dry skin makes my face sting a little. This may change over time, I've only used it 3 or 4 times."
4,"Very sharp but not dangerously sharp. Just be careful when going around areas that aren’t too flat. If you are using these to dermaplane I recommend washing your face and then applying a serum or an oil to your skin so the blade can glide easier. Not great for overly sensitive skin, the blade will strip more than peach fuzz, it sloughs off the first layer of skin too."
4,"I gave these 4 stars instead of 5 because the edge of the blade at the top will cut you if it touches the skin. I used it on my face and it worked well, leaving my skin very soft. (Note: I used it dry for exfoliation.) I did have to go over certain areas 2-3 times to completely remove the hair. However, when I attempted using it around my eyebrows/forehead, the edge of the blade left a long scratch across the top of my eyebrow. Luckily, I wasn't pressing hard, so the scratch will heal quickly with no scar and can be covered with makeup. However, if I was pressing harder, this would have been a major concern as the edge of the blade is very sharp, and I imagine it could cut deeply enough to leave a scar.In short: they work well, but don't press hard and do NOT let the top edge of the blade touch your skin or you may end up with scratches on your face. Take your time with it to ensure safe use."
4,"Not as sharp as others ones I have used and they break easily, but it gets the job done for the time being."
4,Love it!
4,"Better than other brands I have tried. Dull rather quickly, but other than that they are easy to hold and use and don’t irritate my skin."
4,"Works very well, easy to cut yourself so pull skin tight, take your time and do each area once."
4,good
4,Wayyyy sharper than I thought!! The blade is longer than anticipated I tried doing my eyebrows and cut some of my hair because the blade is so long. Definitely would use for face but careful when doing eyebrows!! Wish it came with a warning
4,"This both sounds and feels like I’m trying to trim my eyebrows with sandpaper, leaving my skin feeling scratched and raw afterwards. I used it to shape my eyebrows rather than pluck them so that it wouldn’t damage the follicles if I don’t like it or want to grow them back some day, and it was difficult to see what I was doing. It would be fairly easy to take too much off because of it, and yes I did use the guard that came with it, but I would probably still opt for an eyebrow razor with a much tinier blade in the future."
4,Be careful i sliced myself multiple times....didn't even realize until after when it started bleeding...like little paper cuts...but it works well.
4,Love these!
4,Not sure why they ask about moisturizing I haven’t notice any of that. Have used these more than several times now. They are okay-ish but wondering if there are better ones out there to try since I’m not completely satisfied with these after always hearing good things about this type of tool
4,"I love this product. It gets rid of all of the unwanted peach fuzz on my face and I can also clean up my eyebrows with it. It’s easy to use/hold. My skin is super sensitive though and whenever I use this my skin gets extremely red, and has little razor burn marks on it even though I try to use it with a light hand. It doesn’t stop me from using it though...."
4,Worked really well and got the hair off completely! It’s good for if you just need to touch up before going somewhere for the weekend but the hair will grow back fast because you’re not waxing.
4,"Product works as promised, very easy to use. Worth the price."
4,Didn’t use it but it looks cute excited to use it
4,These work very well. Sharp enough for faceial hair.
4,I didn’t experience much of the moisturizing benefit but thought these were a great but for the cost.
4,"I bought this for facial hair, as I had used the Tinkle eyebrow razor for this purpose. I bought this one as I was intrigued by the exfoliation claim. I cut myself with the edge--definitely my own fault but please be careful!"
4,"Nice blades.  They dull rather quickly, but they work well for about a week each. I like the shape."
4,Good for quick shave but cause stuble
4,"Okay, so these things definitely work. Word of advice, be careful and do not rush. I accidentally took off a little more of my eyebrow than I meant to... at least I know it works now 🤷🏽‍♀️"
4,These work great in a pinch to remove the peach fuzz from your face. They are easy to use and do a great job. Unfortunately they don’t last long and the blade typically falls off before it gets too dull to use. Luckily they are cheap and not meant to last forever.
4,Quick and easy to use
4,"they work for getting fine hairs off of the face, you can't do a full dermaplane with them but they do make your face feel smoother afterwards"
4,These work well but be careful not to overuse if you have sensitive or dry skin. I recommend a soothing moisturizer after using. I like the electric versions but find they break after a few months. This is a good cheaper option.
4,Good purchase pretty much what you paid for
4,Not the best for sensitive skin but not bad for the price. Not the sharpest so had to use multiple times but glad it wasn't extra sharp.
4,"Works well with getting peach fuzz off my cheeks, doesn’t go as smoothly around my chin. Takes some getting use to holding and using smoothly."
4,They dull quickly but work nice till then.
4,"Great product for a low price! Does not bother my sensitive skin at all. Is not a moisturizing tool, which isn’t a surprise."
4,"Love these fun little things! I think they have helped my face a lot since using them, I will definitely recommend them!"
4,Pretty good for the most part. The end could be a little rough if your not careful but overall  buy them again when mine dull for sure.
4,"My only qualm is that they're slightly longer than I would like for the face, however, if you're looking for a product with a few alternative uses these a great. I spent the last 1-2 hours using one to shave the little balls of fuzz that builds up on sweaters, and it worked greatly. My favorite (and cheap) sweater is back to being soft to the touch. It took a while and I haven't bothered with the back, just the front and most of the sleeves but it worked incredibly to restore my crappy stained sweater to being soft again."
4,"Very easy to use and have never cut myself! In addition to hair, nice to remove dead skin. I do notice I break out after and if i apply products there can be some burning."
4,"Easy to use, quicker than plucking eyebrows."
4,"It is just ok. It really does work well, but I found you have to be your guide as to how to hold and use this. I do use it, just wish directions were more descriptive for use"
4,"I love this product. It really does get the job done, but it has cut me a lot of times. you have to be soft and gentle with it, or you will cut yourself. I have cut myself at least 3 times on my face and legs. but if you are gentle slow and soft, you can get rid of your hairs and leave without any cuts. it can definitely cause a lot of damage though since it is an actual blade on your face."
4,They have a strange scrape but they work pretty well for quarantine hair removal.
4,Blading has definitely helped my skin glow by removing the dead skin regularly. It also has gotten rid of the little peach fuzz on the sides of my face nicely. I gave it 4 stars though bc I have had several break just by regular use.
4,the covers for the blade part of it are plastic and easily slide off
4,"These work really well, but there is a definite learning curve. It took about 3 times before I got the hang of it. Very sharp and will nick you, if you're not used to it."
4,Works but wish they were a little sharper.
4,"This product does the job, my face is baby smooth and my brows are clean, but the day after I razored my face, the hairs on my head kept sticking to my face (ex: baby hairs, bangs).  I realized that my natural oils were exposed bc I shaved the fine hairs on my face. I found myself always having to remove and brush my hairs back from my face because they would stick to my cheek or something. Not sure how to relieve the stickiness of my face after using the razor, so if anyone has some tips, I would greatly appreciate it!When I bought this product, I did not see a review that included this warning so I wanted to put it out there for anyone thinking about buying it! Overall, I say this is a great product. It's simple and does the job and also includes a special frame for touching up your brows! I recommend!"
4,"Like any human I get a little peach fuzz on my face. It’s normal and perfectly natural. But for personal interest I got this to help remove the peach fuzziness and the dead skin that accumulates on ones face because I have more of an oily skin type. These worked great for that. Real Easton use and easy to clean, no nicks or razor burns if that’s a concern for anyone. I also have very sensitive skin and these worked well"
4,Works great leaves skin smooth only wish I could get more uses out of each one
4,"This is a very good way to exfoliate cheaply.  It’s not as good as laser treatments, but works well on lighter spots.  It’s good for peach fuzz too.  This is my 2nd purchase.  The only thing I didn’t like was the tip is pointy and very sharp.  I cut myself several times trying to get to nooks and crannies.  Works best if you have fat on you and areas are fuller versus bony.  I think it’s a great, inexpensive way to get rid of rough, dry skin and remove burnt skin or agespots.  👍🏻"
4,"I have tried a few different brands that have totally sucked. They drag, or are too dull, last 1-2 uses, etc.. but these are great & super effective but sharp af! I would definitely recommend, but proceed with caution.Side note: I have very sensitive skin & I almost always have irritation after using a razor of any kind, but these don't irritate me at all!"
4,"Be careful, I underestimated the sharpness of this beautiful blade and ended up cutting my face here and there lmao. Just little stings nothing major I recommend being light handed with it. It cleans up my mustache and eyebrows really nice"
4,"It's very simple, a blade attached to a plastic handle, but it is more useful as a facial scraper to remove fine hairs and rough spots on the face."
4,"These are sharper, work better, and last longer than the amazon cult classics.  I don't love the design of the edge as it can scrape you when going over certain areas. Will continue to purchase"
4,"Easy to use and work fairly well. I can always feel stubble still even with my peach fuzz, granted I have dark hair so maybe that’s why."
4,"I used this for the first time on my entire face. I got sick of tweezing/waxing my upper lip (blame it on the dark-haired ancestors). It definitely got rid of all the peach fuzz on my face, but it hurt my face. So far, I haven't broken out from it or anything, but my face definitely felt raw. Granted, I used it without anything on my face, which was probably my biggest mistake. I will definitely use with some sort of face oil from here on out."
4,Very useful and works great
4,"I love this product so much, it rakes off peach fuzz with ease, my only problem was that it goes dull quickly. i will be buying again though"
4,"I had never heard of shaving my face so I decided to give it a try after watching many youtube videos.  I was thrilled at how easy it was and how soft my face felt after.  When you put on your foundation it looks better because no peach fuzz to deal with.  Thrilled with the outcome and will be doing this from now on.  Give it a try, just hold your face taught and shave in a downward motion."
4,"Careful, some of the blades are too sharp at the ends and will scratch you."
4,I wish they would make a razor for left handed people. The cutting blade is only on one side.
4,"These blades are probably the sharpest ones I’ve ever come across for eyebrows but that’s not necessarily a bad thing! I recommend you take extra precaution and use a very light touch. I Did end up making a couple cuts my first try but it was nothing a little neosporin Couldn’t make disappear by morning. Again, use a very light touch and make sure you shave at the right angle because these are very sharp"
4,"I really like these, but they get dull for me after only a couple of uses. They’re pretty cheap so it’s not too bad, but I think I’ll try a different brand next time. My skin is usually sensitive to shaving, but these didn’t irritate my skin at all so that definitely a plus."
4,"I decided to try this product after seeing some youtube videos, and I am pleased with the results it gives me.  I hate plucking my eyebrows...don't get them waxed because that's just too painful for me.  I also use these for the peach fuzz on my face (again after watch some videos) and I like how my skin feels.  I would recommend them.  It takes a little trial and error at first to get the hang of it, but they are easy to use."
4,Awesome for the price
4,"First time using this, I'm amazed"
4,"This product is great for women's mustache area and also the peach fuzz.  It removes the hair easily and leaves you with a smooth feeling immediately after using this.  However, I do get a stubble feeling several hours after you've shaved the hair off which softens as the days go by after shaving.  I also get some pimples after using this so I make sure I use toner right away to treat the skin.  If you have any raised moles on your face, be careful, it will cut them very easily.  I bought a fancy battery operated hair remover which is just a very loud and inefficient shaver.  Save your money and buy these.  Overall, very happy with this product for the price."
4,Don’t use on dry skin. But very good derma-planer to get rid of peach fuzz and shape brows. Easy to use once you get the hang of it.
4,These are extremely sharp! I barely went over a few parts above my eyebrows and had little cuts on my face the next day. You have to be extremely careful not to press hard against the skin. I'm not sure if the blade was cutting me or the little metal part the covers the blade but either way be very careful. It does the job otherwise.
4,"These are much sharper than the generic, no name eyebrow razors I normally buy. Unfortunately that meant I accidentally made a bunch of tiny nicks in my face without realizing it and now it looks like I got in a fight with my cat. On the other hand they exfoliate my face much better than the razors I used to use. Ultimately, I'm pretty pleased with them, but just be careful when you use them if you are used to eyebrow razors that are a bit dull."
4,I accidentally shaved too much of my eyebrow hair off but very easy to use. Your face hair will not grow back thicker.
4,these work great on your face.  i use oil with this and its not good because after a while it fall apart.  I would need to find something else to work with it because it really does clean the face really good.
4,"It's good, sharp razor, use it on my face and do my eyebrows with it."
4,"I like that it gets the job done. It’s a great, cheap tool to get rid of dirt/dry skin. Simple little dermaplaning. However, be VERY careful because it will leave little nicks on your face if you apply too much force/pressure."
4,Work well. They stay sharp for a couple of uses.
4,Good quality. It is very sharp so just be careful.
4,Easy to use......excellent product..
4,Does the job.  Its a good product for the price.  Recommend the purchase.
4,I like flawless products this one is just ok I dont think it works as well as the original and the blade gets warm not enough to burn or hurt but it does get warm
4,Easy to use. Does it’s job well just had a little redness and swelling on my upper lip. Which went away in an hour or so. Other than that no complain. 👍
4,"Ease of use and great on the go. Recommend buying replacement heads with purchase,  so you can have on hand when you need to replace."
4,loved it & would recommend it
4,Works fine so far
4,I like this. I have oily saggy skin so it's not always easy for me to circle it easily over my skin.
4,It's pretty standard. Does as well of a job as the others I have bought off amazon. It's not the best thing ever but it definitely does the job.
4,This shaver is good for small areas and works well but doesn't get completely smooth on close shaved that have been previously shaved.The shaver gets close to completely smooth but not quit completely smooth. It's pretty to look at and easy to use.
4,This didn’t work very well for me.  Used it my upper lip. Seemed that hair grew back twice as fast as other options I’ve had.  Works good but not for me
4,They said they enjoyed it.
4,"It does it’s job very neatly. But not a very smooth process. Takes some time to grab facial hair. But much better than razor no cuts ,no pain especially no damage to the skin."
4,Good product.  It’s essentially a discrete shaver for women.
4,"Over a year later, still loving my Flawless!  I'm pretty sure it's still the original battery,  as well!  The light is basically useless (small/dim and mis-directed)  ... but it isn't necessary anyway.Perfect for shaping the brows, and it's handy size makes getting rid of that stray chin hair (you never noticed at home!?) quick and discreet!"
4,"Easy to use, works great."
4,Works okay. A little small. Have another and it’s much larger.
4,"easy to use, exactly what I wanted"
4,"my only thing with it - there is this stage after say a week when the growing hairs are at the length that if you touch your face it feels like a soft stubble (not a man's stubble, but still...) it does grow out after some time, but you need to be prepared for that interim weird stage."
4,"Like that this hair remover works better than my old one that was getting worn out.  But don't like that this is a battery operated instead of being a lithium reachable battery item.  When my husband of 40 plus years made the comment that he could see a lot of hair under my nose, I knew I needed to to do something.  Many women at an older age (going thru menopause) get the five o'clock shadow of hair (peach fuzz) and this device takes care of that."
4,wife likes -works as described
4,"Does not seem to have full power. Also does not have good blade, not bad just not what I  expected.  Although it could have been returned after someone previously used it.  The box was revealed and wires etc put back unwound."
4,Just kidding.  I use the product to shave fine hair on my face.  Let's hope I don't turn into Chewbacca after frequent use.  Hahahaha.
4,It works well and is easy to use.
4,It is perfect for facial hair. Battery lasts a long time. I wouldn't recommend using it on your bikini area. It gave me some serious bumps and ingrown hairs.
4,Good for peach fuzz but if you’re a hairier woman like myself you will also need to use the Percision razor as well
4,Liked product
4,This product is very pretty and does its job. My only complaint is that you have to remove the top and clean out the inner chamber after each use.
4,"It's super convenient to use and easily fits in my purse for on the go. However, it doesn't give a very close shave if that's what you're looking for."
4,"This hair remover really is as it describes---flawless.  I would go a step further and say that it also is very quiet and works well on my sensitive skin.  I am impressed that the battery is included, which saves an extra trip or internet search for a battery.  I opened the package, snapped in the battery and fired it up.  It cleaned the little hard-to-clean hairs from my chin, leaving my face smooth for a couple days at a time. (BTW, I also own the brow shaver and its ability to clean my brows prompted me to purchase this one).  I have used this shaver approximately for times in the past three days and am happy with the results.  It is my hope to keep it handy while traveling for those quick clean up of embarrassing fuzz on the chin and neck.  Furthermore, the lipstick shape is an ingenious delight. I cannot speak to the battery life yet but I hope the battery lasts a long time."
4,"Works well on light peach fuzz.  Only reason it’s not a 5 star review is that it does leave a few little hairs, that I see only when using a magnifying mirror."
4,Very easy to use. Cute design. Doesn't leave a smooth just shved feel but works to remove hair quickly in a pinch!
4,"I wasn't sure how I would feel about this, but have struggled with feeling awkward about my bristley blonde (and some dark) whiskers for years. This little shaver works great. It gets close, but never so close to cause in grown hairs. So far it seems like the blades are working for quite a while and the little LED light is convenient for under chin. I asked a dermatologist about facial hair removal and she recommended that waxing is too aggressive and the threat of ingrown hairs is bad. I have used electrolysis before, but it is expensive and takes a long time. I honestly feel a lot better about my face now and this feels manageable."
4,I Ike it saves time and it's painless which is awesome. My only 2 complaints are 1 it gets hot while using. 2 you have to pass it more then once over the same area
4,"Great for whisking off fuzz and occasional whiskers. Battery is underpowered for coarse hair-need a plug in version if you're growing full chin whiskers, yanked more than cut, had to dab those a bunch to trim, and wound up with deep acne anyway. Check the recommended products carefully, algo recommended the wrong replacement heads when I purchased."
4,Painless hair removal
4,Wish it was rechargeable
4,It’s like a razor and good for emergencies when you want to do your eyebrows
4,"Very easy to use, the only thing I didn't like is that it is battery operated. I have another one of these that is rechargeable and I think that one is better."
4,Works like a charm! Small cute and does the job. It does feel a bit cheaper than other brands and the bottom part comes off frequently. For the price and what I need it for (my face) it is great.
4,Flawless Hair Removal was what I expected it to be.  It is not as smooth as waxing.  It is good for that one invisible hair you feel but can see to be removed.  I gave it an overall of 4 stars because it feels like a stubby hair after using.  I don't enjoy the waxing process either.  In a pinch this is the best so far.
4,"Works great , easy to use and nice compact size"
4,So easy to use and it really works great! Much nicer and more efficient then an epilator.
4,It Was A Gift
4,I only wish it was a bit quieter.
4,It easy to use and results will be fine in few minutes
4,This great for those pesky fine hairs. You need to use the lightest pressure or it struggles and sounds like better is low.
4,Good product and service
4,"Bought this for my mother, this is her second one in a couple years. First one was purchased at Walmart and just quit one day. So we picked this one out. Cute, easy to use and take it on the go!"
4,"I love the design and concept , just wish the “cut” would last longer"
4,Better than I thought but didn't know what to expect.Works good and does the job.  Tickets but sometimes it feels like it's pulling my hair
4,"The device is very easy to use and the built-in light is convenient. The design is pretty and is small and easy to travel with. I am also surprised with the battery life. I've been using it twice and month for 2 years already and the battery is still working. However, even though the device is called a hair removal device, please don't expect it to have any magical effects like removing hair without making it grow thicker. This is just a hair trimmer for sensitive skin. The hair will grow back and it will grow darker and thicker."
4,Do yourself a favor and buy this at Walgreens in a nice clean box. Also make sure to buy the newest model being advertised on tv now. I have bought two different ones from Amazon and one was fine and the other was not so good but the one  at Walgreens was great!
4,Good for hair removal
4,"Update...only con is when you remove the head, be very very careful. It fell and 4 small pieces went flying. I tried to reassemble but don’t think I have it right bc when you push down the motor stops. Still an Amazing product as long as in working order. It is a game changer for me! Used to get my ladystache threaded bc it was the smoothest look but with Covid thought I’d try this and I’m so glad I bought it! My upper lip is hairless and smooth after using it. Easy, painless and great results! I will never thread again as that is painful. Recommended the same night I used it to my sister and she purchased one as well and just as pleased. We were both used to using on of those little trimmers at home which leave that stubble feeling because the hair isn’t being pulled from the roots. Don’t waste money on any other product ladies!"
4,It’s a nice product and works well.
4,"It works ok . Easy to use. My skin still reacted to it , just a little though. I was fine the next day. I did it before bed."
4,"I like the product so much I bought my roomie one for Christmas. You do need to replace the head on occasion, and when you do you will be surprised on how well it works again. I should have replaced the head way sooner than I did as it made it work like brand new and the price of the 4 replacement heads is not bad at all. :-)"
4,"I bought this because as I’ve gotten older, I’ve noticed my peach fuzz has gotten thicker and I can see it in the sunlight. I wasn’t sure what to expect based on some of the other reviews but tried it anyway. Fortunately, I received the real Flawless product.  I saw the other review with the pictures of Real and Counterfeit and inspected mine thoroughly..  I suspect that the people who say theirs did not work etc received a counterfeit product. My suggestion - compare your product with those pictures.  Mine was definitely authentic and I love it! It is painless and it works - my peach fuzz is gone.  You open the top part and dump out the little clump of fuzz.  So glad I bought it!"
4,"As far as convenience, I love it. It also has saved me money and time as I no longer get my lip and chin waxed. When you first use it your skin is silky smooth. I find if you go over the same spot numourous times, the skin does get a tad irritated but not to much and certainly no big deal. The only issue I have with it is since my hair is a bit thick, I have to use it everyday if I want my skin completely smooth, every other if I don’t mind a little stubble. Quite honestly it is really a glorified electric razor. The hair grows back thicker as it would if you used a razor. But even with that being said I do recommend this product. I just use it very frequently to keep the stubble away.If you have thinner hair I think it would work even better. Even when I was getting waxed I found I had to tweeze a week after waxing. Good product. Highly recommend."
4,"It seems they have updated the style and the razor heads.  Calling them Generation 2 if you need to order new replacement heads. Some of the reviewers seem to think this is a fake product.  My only issue with it is trying to get it open to put in the battery, it is very hard to get apart, hence the 4 stars.  Tried it and works great so far, can't account for battery life at this time."
4,Works good.  I expected it to shave closer then it does.
4,Very easy to use and assemble
4,Excellent
4,Doesn't pain at all.
4,Very Handy product for day ro day ise and easy to clean. Also worked perfectly for sensitive skin. I wish it had slightly better battery life.
4,"Easy to use, good on sensitive skin. Small and compact to carry in your purse for on the go."
4,this is a fine product but watch your eyelashes if you do around your eyes
4,"This works! It got all my hair and didn’t irritate my skin. I just thought it would get a closer shave. It just trimmed, so now I have peach fuzz stubble which feels tougher then you’d think. But overall it did its job and my makeup does go on easier."
4,"Worked great on the peach fuzz along my jaw line and the coarse dark hairs on my upper lip, chin, and neck. Wish I would have found this years ago and avoided all that bleaching, plucking, and embarrassment. Thought the light was frivolous, but it's great for illuminating the fine hairs you might miss under normal overhead room light.Can't give it 5 stars though, as I bought it in January 2020 and its already dying. Changed the battery twice with no difference. And I don't need to use it every day. So I've had to order a new one 10 months later. Testimony to how much I love it, though!"
4,"Its okay. Works fine. Takes little like longer to finish the job, than I would like. Have to go over and over same area to get a close shave."
4,This product is useful and really easy to use. I don’t recommend using on your chin because it does leave a few bumps. But it does work good on peachfuzz and I do recommend.
4,"This was a gift, but the recipient says it's easy to use and doesn't irritate her skin. She does use a moisturizer after each use."
4,"At first I was thrilled and loved this - I had switched from using facial nair hair remover to this.  my mom uses it and loves it.  I feel like the nair did a better job, and took less effort, but this shaver is definitely a safer and I guess healthier way than chemically burning with lotion.  I will probably end up using both, alternating ways!"
4,"The product was generally extremely easy to use and easy to clean. When you first take it out of the package it does feel a little on the cheaper end but once the battery is in it feels a little more durable. With regards to the sound, It is kind of loud, not as discreet as I was hoping. The product does a good job of removing the hair, the skin feels pretty smooth right after use."
4,It's a very good product and easy to use and clean. But not good for sensitive skin.
4,"I just tried this on my chin and lip hair and I was surprised that it works pretty well, not perfectly but good for the price. You should start off with clean dry skin and pull that area taunt and press closely in circular motions. I didn't have any long hairs so it may be a different story in that case but I plan on letting my Chiny chin chin hairs grow longer and see if it does a good job! I would recommend it and say use it regularly. The replacement heads sold by amazon Are Not compatible with this unit so you may have to go to flawless website for the proper ones! I can't comment on battery life yet nor skin sensitivity. My face was pretty warm while using it."
4,"unlike the Finishing Touch wider surface, older product, there is more work involved with going over the face multiple times in circular motions and this Flawless product simply takes longer because the surface area is smaller. Still, simple to use and small enough to use for daily use and while traveling. One thing I'd recommend is a way to have the brush attach directly to the product so it won't get easily lost and because it is needed for cleaning out the Flawless head. Also, I wish replaceable razor attachments were available for sale for the previous Finishing Touch product."
4,It’s easy to use
4,Great at removing facial hair. It did not irritate my skin. I would purchase again as a gift.
4,No complaints works as expected!
4,Ladies this thing is perfect to keep in your car for when you find all those annoying little hairs.
4,Works great so far.
4,Cool for baby hair
4,"This product does not pluck the hair like most epilators do. That being said, it does get very close to the skin. I am very happy with the product because I have sensitive(ish) skin and I wouldn't want it to be red for too long. After I get my eyebrows waxed my skin is still a little red the next day. I will be recommending this in the future."
4,"It did what I needed it to do. I can’t complain.  Salons were closed. I used for the fine peach fuzz that I know is there, and the person who cuts my hair would take care of it for me. Now I can!"
4,Easy to use. Painless.
4,"Did very good for such a small shaver, very convenient i will say that, but you may have to go over some spots for a little longer to get rid of all the hair, great product though fits perfectly in my bag!"
4,"It’s ok, I really wasn’t convinced at first it didn’t seem to work but I tried it again and it’s ok. Have to use regularly to keep hair easy to remove that seems to be the trick"
4,Super good but doesn't leave my skin smooth though. It sometimes pulls on my thicker hairs...ow! Otherwise does a good job.
4,Love this thing
4,"The only thing I don't like is that I do have to use it about every other day.  One of the ""joys"" of getting older are those icky wiry little hairs that sprout on your chin!!!  This little cutie gets rid of them, at least for a while and WILL remove them when they are barely back out so you don't have to wait until you can tweeze them out.  I like it :-)"
4,This is good.  Nothing to dislike
4,For the most part it works well. It didn’t remove the hair as close as I thought it would.
4,"This product does a good job of removing hair from my face and other areas.  However, I have to use it frequently as it doesn’t get as close as a razor."
4,"I ordered the color 'Coral', and I got a pinkish/purple. Other than that, its a great product and it works wonderfully. It's still a pretty color and couldn't be happier with the product. -Mollie"
4,"It's not going to blow you away, but it does what it claims. It is lightweight and feels a bit cheap, but it does work and that is all that matters. It's a great price and easy to use for someone (like me) who has issues with upper lip hair growing super fast."
4,a little flimsy but seems to work good.
4,"First time I used it, it was magic! So I purchased my own. I think it works okay. Nothing special. I have one chin hair that grows thick no matter what and this is a great touch up tool for when I’m in the go and notice it peeking its ugly little head. My husband is amused. Everyone likes it, they always end up purchasing one for themselves."
4,"I have used it twice. So far so good. Can’t say anything about battery life yet, too soon. Very easy to use, no pain or discomfort at all. Does a good job. My only complaint is that I ordered a blue one (as in the picture) and I received a pink one. I wanted it different because my sister has the same. Needed to start using It right away so I didn’t have time to send it back."
4,I had fine little hairs on my jaw line and it was easily removed.  It did not make any marks or dry patches.  I may order another one for my daughter.
4,"Small as a lipstick, easy to use, and has a light for you to see the area you are applying it to.  Because it shaves, rather than pulls, it doesn't hurt, but do know that you would have to use it more often than tweezers.  Makes a great girlfriend gift!!!"
4,"So far its working! It does remove unwanted hair easily, like your mustache, and under the chin and over the lip hair.  It leaves your skin nice and smooth and clear of hair."
4,No fuss easy to use product. Good for use at home and easy to carry when traveling. I have tried couple of them before but didn't go well with my skin but this one does and that's the reason I am here to share my experience. I feel battery life should be improved. Thanks.
4,"Hair removal is super easy, and touch-ups take seconds.  Unit removes hair cleanly without pulling or pinching.  My skin felt a little extra sensitive for a few days after first use, but that didn't last.  Super easy to clean.  The light isn't helpful at all, but I didn't buy it for the light.  Bottom line, it removes hair painlessly, very easily, and very well."
4,Works great but I wish it was blue
4,Nice product quick delivery
4,it works well and easy to use
4,"There have been a lot of negative reviews for this product, but ultimately I found it works well for me. I have peach fuzz on my upper lip and it did remove the hair nicely. I think if you have very fine hair that needs to be removed this will do the trick."
4,"I got sick of tweezing, laser doesn't work for me, I don't like electrolysis because it can damage the skin, so I purchased this little device. It does work (if you get any of your head hair in the way, kiss those strands goodbye), but because this is actually a shaver with blades, you're simply cutting the hair off at the skin level, and you'll probably need to use the device the very next day or in two or three days at most.It's very simple to use. As I mentioned above, just make sure you have all the hair you don't want to cut out of the way, and whisk the device in small circles over your face. It shouldn't take more than a minute or two. You'll end up with a face with no hair...for a day or two. I have hair that grows very, very fast, but not much on my face at all, luckily. This gets rid of it and leaves my face very smooth and soft, but I find I need to use it almost daily.Now, this will not irritate your skin at all, so if you have sensitive skin, no worries. And, using this device will not cause your hair to grow in coarser than it was before. If anything, it will grow in finer. I used another brand for several years, and I find the few facial hairs I do have (on my chin, yuk) grow in very fine, not coarse at all. They may seem coarser because they are blunt cut rather than tapered, but please, believe me, they are not coarser in the slightest. So, no worries there, either. Over time, I think you'll find the hair gets finer and finer.But please be clear on one thing: this is a shaver; it is not an epilator. If you want to pull hair out by the roots, you'll need to buy an actual epilator, and it will cost a great deal more than this device. You could always wax, but the trouble with waxing, at least for me, is that you must let hair grow in somewhat (about 1/4 in) in between waxings. You can't keep you face totally hair free, and I want my face totally hair free at all times. So, even though this isn't perfect, I use this device rather than wax or epilate or tweeze. I even carry a second one with me in my purse in case I find I need a quick touch up.This works best on dry skin that has just been freshly cleaned. I use it after I cleanse and exfoliate, but before my toner, essence, oil, serum, and moisturizer, of course. I like this. I like having a totally hair free skin at all times. I do wish it pulled the hair out by the roots, so, not having sensitive skin, I may epilate instead some day. But I do like the convenience of having this little device in my purse at all times. It means I can be hair free at a moment's notice.This is fine to use; it is painless and quick and simple. Just be aware of its limitations."
4,"Bought this for my 85 yr old Mom, she had (she's  gonna be mad I told ya'll ) a couple chin hairs... notice I said HAD because they are gone now... this is Great! If a 85 yr old woman can use it anyone can! LOL"
4,This is a good product. Gave it 4 Stars because I thought it was a epilator and the advertisement did not make it clear that it was just a high quality electric razor. Otherwise all - good.
4,Good gift
4,Upgrade from tweezers and mirror! Easy to use.
4,Much better than flawless brow. This actually works.
4,Works exceptionally well on face except for around eyebrows.
4,Love the product but Can’t replace battery
4,It's very effective & easy to use.
4,"Got this for my teen son to rid of his fuzzy mustache, works great but Im thinking once that fuzz turns to whiskers it might not work as well. But he has some time before that happens. This is nice so that he doesn't have to start shaving so soon."
4,"UPDATE:See below for original review.Got the 1st unit. I was satisfied.  Therefore I purchased a 2nd unit. It did not work. Had a motor problem. I returned it for a replacement. The 3rd unit worked better than the 1st unit.CONCLUSION: The bad quality control ny the manufacturer tells me they are producing these units at such a high profit margin that they do not care.I will buy another because overall it is the most reliable solution I have discovered to deal with my female facial hair problem. But if it does not work I will return until I get one that works as well as the 3rd unit I received.The absolute best solution for me for removing feminine facial hair. Needs a fully charged battery for best power. Also must change the shaving head at least every month and a half for best performance. But, the nominal cost of blade is nothing for the convenience of quick easy removal.  Wish I had found this sooner.  Just bought my 2nd. Will be buying a 3rd and forth for my purses. I simply don't want to misplace this. It has become a necessity."
4,"I have very sensitive skin. Waxing the peach fuzz off my jaw never ends well for me. This has been a godsend for when those little hairs have gotten too visible for my liking. It's very quick and easy to use. I also love that it uses a standard AA battery, so I don't have to take up an outlet charging it like I do with the leg shaver (which I have mixed feelings about).I had heard it could be used on the bikini area without problem. THAT IS NOT THE CASE. The hair near the bikini line is too thick for these little blades to handle. I had a hair get caught, jammed the razor, and basically had to be pulled out by the root--ow! THIS PRODUCT SHOULD BE USED ON FINE PEACH-FUZZ HAIRS ONLY.This could maybe be used on arm hair, but that seems like a lot of space to cover for a small device. If you regularly want to shave your arm hair, you'd probably be better off getting a larger leg shaver that covers more area and will save you time."
4,"Just arrived today, easy to use and my sensitive skin had no issues! Only complaint is that I didn't get the color that I ordered, so somehow my sister and I are going to try and distinguish between ours since they're identical. Other than that, no complaints!"
4,"I don’t think the battery was still good because the 2nd time of use it sounded like it was going to die, but I think the item works well and is painless."
4,"The battery doesn’t last long if it is used a lot. It is small, easy to carry, and is creatively disguised to look like a large lipstick case."
4,I would have given this a 5 star rating but I didn’t get the color I ordered. The product is great though. I’ve been using my moms and finally ordered my own! Definitely recommend.
4,"Works pretty well. I was pleasantly surprised. I bought b/c I couldn’t get my eyebrows/lips waxed during covid. It did the job.  However I found that after I used it, I got immediate regrowth. Not horrible, but definitely not the same as waxing.  Also, I don’t really recommend this device if you plan on using it just for your eyebrows. The device head is to wide & big to do a clean job around the eyebrows."
4,"Works well. I feel like the hair remover could be easier to move on your skin, and sometimes it takes a few swipes to get all the hair. I use it for my eyebrows, lip, and swimsuit line for touch ups, and knees if I miss anything from shaving.I usually wax my eyebrows every 3 weeks and tweeze in-between. I used this shaver on my brows over a month ago and I’m just noticing that they need done again.It’s worth the usefulness and convenient to have on hand."
4,Love this product I use everyday
4,It works like they say it will.
4,"I got this product because due to the current situation I was starting to give my 10 year old son competition. With no place to go get my lipped wax I had to figure out what to do. This product was easy to use. Worked well, removing all the hair/peach fuzz on my upper lip. It felt a little warm on my skin as I used it but nothing to complain about.It’s worth the purchase."
4,I love this product leaves my skin smooth. It's fast convenient and pain free and cost effective
4,"Got this during covid19 pandamic.Serves the purposePainlessEasy to useJust takes a couple of minutes and you are doneWith eyebrows, you need to use this in combination with a tweezer and you get the salon results.I highly recommend this, handy during travel. Looks just like a lipstick"
4,It's light weight and easy to use. It's also pretty. I ordered rose gold. I have course hair growth on the side of my face and although you cannot see the hair after shaving you can feel the stubble. Must use it daily.
4,"Thinking this was an apple later I bought it I was wrong it’s not an epilator but it’s handy on those days when you forget that you have a few whiskers on your chin and you have a meeting and you need something to make them somewhat disappear I mean if I use it before I put on my make up yeah it works but if I wasn’t wearing make up you might notice . It’s OK on the chin, it’s sort of OK on the neck and it does the job on the sides of the face. I don’t think it’s the greatest thing that happened to women with facial hair issues but it’s a good emergency grab when you don’t have any other options."
4,Fine so far!
4,Easy and nice fast way to get ready everywereWith a litle cheap material but good for the price
4,"So I have PCOS, was kinda skeptical on purchasing as my hairs thicker and I’ve been shaving for a good 10 years usually areas most females don’t necessarily shave. It does what it’s supposed to, but it doesn’t come as close to a close shave as regular razors do. It left my skin feeling itchy, but for the most part soft. Super easy to use but I recommend using this on not already shaved hair, it just doesn’t remove all the hair like a regular razor would if it was previously shaved. Plus side to this is no bleeding or razor burn. I will definitely continue to use this, but will probably have to touch up with a regular razor."
4,Fantastic for sensitive skin! It’s also very easy to use but the battery life doesn’t last long at all.PLEASE ONLY USE THIS FOR YOUR FACE. I tried using it on my arms and the quality immediately went down.
4,"Easy to use, painless, and easy to clean. I only disagree with them stating that your hair won't grow back thick and black 'cause mine does :/"
4,"Love it, easy to use, and is exactly as described. I am very happy 😊 with my purchase😊☺️😎👍♥️❗️"
4,"Turn out to be a good mother's day gift. My wife ordered one off the TV an never received it she was a little aggravated, she kept talking about it so I found her one an she loves it. Shipping was great received it like 2 days early. Thanks"
4,Easy to use BUT the hair grows right back and heavier. Do not use on full face or you will be using it daily.
4,"I like this a lot, it is exactly as specified. It does everything it says it does."
4,"Tried it on my face and on a part of my arm for sharing here.You can definitely feel it removing the hair, but it doesn't hurt. I like that it comes with a battery (it was cute that it also had some rose gold color to it to match).It does leave a very fine, short, peach fuzz-like feeling, but it's not bad. Although I was hoping for something more smooth, I think the tiny bit it doesn't fully remove is probably a good thing (at least for me) because afterwards my face became very oily and I feel if it had been a skin-close shave, my face would have been even more oily.Now that it's been a few days, it is less oily, the hair is still pretty short. Thankfully, my sebum production seems to have mellowed, so I'm not a grease ball. But somehow I think the little bit of peach fuzz helps reduce that.What I'm really looking forward to is doing my makeup because I originally bought this to get rid of the longer, thicker facial hair I have from being an unfortunately severely insecure teenager who shaved once to get rid of peach fuzz and it grew back thicker and has stayed that way since I learned my lesson the first time. But I digress.That hair that has stayed thicker and longer really messed with my makeup and I hate how it looks with my face extra furry, so hopefully short fuzz won't mess with it too much. We shall see!"
4,Does not irate my highly sensitive skin at all. Works wonders for the peach fuzz from my face. Even used it on my husbands neck (hairline) and it worked amazing on him. I feel I need to say he is African-American so consumers know what type of hair he has... I was able to give him a decent cleanup job on the back of this head/neck since his barber's shop is closed due to COVID-19
4,Received it today & tried it for the first time ... love it! Easy to use and nice & smooth!
4,Easy to use.
4,I like it so far because I can use it for facial hair but I was hoping I didn't have to but a separate one for lower hair.
4,Next time Please Put My Packages Behind The Pole on the Porch but Overall Eveything Fine
4,This is nothing more than a battery powered razor!  Does it work...yes...but it is a temporary solution!
4,Just tried it once.  Works well.
4,Changing my previous review.. this actually works but only on fine soft hair like my upper lip. This does not work on eyebrows.
4,Love this product. I’ve bought several of these over the years - my others have broken due to other factors not the quality of the item. Easy to use. I use once a week to keep my face smooth and fuzz free!
4,Good product for light facial hair.
4,Did just what it said. Good product.
4,"I think this actually works, it was easy to use, you just have to keep it in place on the skin and it does the job. No aggressive touch, no redness, I felt the skin nice and smooth after."
4,This does the job. I love looking at all the hair it gets after I'm done. The light on the shaver is very helpful. I've used this almost daily since it arrived. Did notice my skin was very dry a few day after first using it. No complaints.
4,Was a Gift & Received Well!!
4,Yes it did a great job removing hair but it also tarnished my rings in the process. I had no idea that was going to happen.
4,works amazing but reeks to high hell. my family could smell it throughout the whole house but works perfectly
4,"This is a P.S.A. to anyone who is thinking of buying this product:FOR THE LOVE OF GOD WEAR SOME GLOVES OR TAKE OFF ANY RINGS YOU ARE WEARING BEFORE USING THIS! I had silver rings on all my fingers using this (my idiotic fault I know) and all my rings turned a blueish-black color. Luckily, I had some silver cleaner and it took it right off but like… what is that?!And also, PLEASE DO THIS IN AN ENCLOSED SPACE. IT WILL LEGIT STICK UP YOUR WHOLE HOUSE!!! And it lingers!!!  I did it in the bathroom and closed the door and my whole house still smells. Best way to describe the scent is… the smell of a perm but worse mixed with rotten eggs. LOL. (No for real though.) You smell it in the container and it really isn’t so bad but as soon as you mix it with water, it’s like “BAM!!! SMELL ME, BISH.”But on the plus side, it does work at removing hair. I think it’s pretty close to how Nair works, so I would recommend getting that instead just due to the smell alone this emits…"
4,"ok i did this outside bc i knew it was gonna smell terrible but it worked well, i still have some hair in some spots but it’s not noticeable!! the only flaw is that it smells like rotten eggs"
4,Works great. Smells as horrible as reviews warned. Use vent and lots ad lotion after...it’s worth tolerating the smell
4,Works really good doesn’t irritate my skin it does work really good moisturize your skin good after and the only downside is that it smells terrible
4,"Good News- It works!!!Bad News- It works!! ...too good if you aren’t careful! Seriously though, use with caution because they weren’t kidding when they labeled it maximum strength!More Bad News- The smell. If you have a sweet spot for rotten egg farts then you’ll think you hit the jackpot with this!! Your entire bathroom(in my case bathroom and bedroom since they are connected) will smell like rotten eggs for at least the next 8-12hrs. I wish i was exaggerating.*Please keep in mind who and what this product was originally intended for. -primarily men of color with EXTRA coarse  and stubborn facial hair. Not white girl leg hair!*And it’s DEFINITELY NOT intended for any your bikini line and it’s surrounding parts. Ladies if you take anything at all from this warning please gawd let it be this. Unless you enjoy chemical burns and blisters on your hot box then don’t even attempt it. There are other products that offer fantastic results without the agony. (Veet is my favorite and the smells like your favorite flower compared to this)"
4,"Works great, smells awful."
4,Works but you do have to keep the area you are treating damp as this product sets into the hair and it has a sulfuric odor so work in a well vented area and keep a misting spray bottle on hand
4,"This works amazingly well. Just follow the instructions and the hair just comes right off. So easy, so satisfying. The downside is the smell isn't good, but it's no big deal. It didn't make me gag or anything like that! Just light a candle when you're done or whatever. The other thing is that I had a zit and didn't think about this product on that, but that did sting a bit. Also not a big deal, but of course it would be great if that didn't happen."
4,"Great item, wish it was a larger"
4,It works yes how ever it dryer my skin out and it smells like death. But it works lol I didn't have any reactions to it. However for ppl that have reactions to nair shouldn't use with out testing on small patch of skin. Make sure to moisturize after.
4,This product smells terrible like rotten eggs. Even though it did smell awful it was very easy to use and went great. Removed hair super fast and you get no ingrown hairs or bumps like you would get if you were shaving.
4,Works really well. Did not irritate my skin and I have very sensitive skin. Only issue is it smell bad. Open a window before you use it or do it outside if you can.
4,This product does smell so get out your candles or air fresheners before you start. Otherwise this product works great!!
4,This stuff work but the smell is awful! It has a strong sulfur smell to it. I used it on my legs though and it did the job.
4,"Works like a charm, but smells strong. So bring a fan."
4,"Item smells awful... it worked similar to NAIR for me. Except nair smells marginally better... I prefer burning hair to rotting garbage. When I say it worked like nair... it didn’t take all of my hair off as intended and left patches. Nair does the same. It didn’t irritate my skin which was good, but that smell.... I needed to take an extra shower after to feel like I’d gotten rid of the smell. I still used this product."
4,"I have used Nair and this smells worse than that but it’s not as strong. I barely notice it but the bathroom will smell like rotten eggs for a day. I use it everywhere and it works well on thick hair. I used an old worn out exfoliating glove to remove it (gently) that I use only for this. No burning or irritation like I got with Nair and shaving. I will say it’s not perfect and sometimes leaves small patches of hair. It also doesn’t seem to perform too well on super fine hair for some reason. It just burns the hair and they shrivel up and feel like thick stubble, but I’m unable to rub the hair off. Leave it on a minute longer if you need to and don’t have any burning or irritation. When I get out of the shower and my skin dries, I’ll notice some product leftover in random spots including on my feet and between my toes for some reason. So make sure to scrub everywhere really well before you get out. I like that it’s a low waste product compared to using a bunch of razors, plastic containers of Nair, or wax strips. Not sure if you can recycle it though."
4,Smells bad and gets messy but works great
4,Definitely removes hair!!!! Smell is putrid. I used on my legs. Not sure how anyone could stand the smell on their face yuck. Dried out my skin a fit and turned my bath tub orange- maybe a chemical reaction? Not sure.. but this stuff really does work!
4,"Oh gosh, the smell is awful. You get a used to it pretty quickly while mixing and applying but any housemates might have an issue so far this is the best thing I've used on my face! I have skin conditions that constantly cause ingrown hairs and this is the least affected by that so I have my best skin."
4,Works great but makes our entire 3600 sqft house smell like rotten eggs for a few hours afterwards even when used in the bathroom with the doors closed and windows open.
4,It stinks like rotten egg but it  gets the job done pretty efficiently.
4,"I really like it, it makes shaving 10x easier seriously. The only thing is that it smells disgusting and I’m too scared to use it on more sensitive parts of my body because of how strong that smell is. My only complaint is the smell, but that’s fine because I only need it for my legs, really."
4,"It’s chemical so if you get a chemical burn, don’t be surprised. If you have sensitive skin please do NOT USE. Don’t use it for eyebrows! lmao I got chemical burn. I use it for my legs and arms. And it works great! I hate shaving so this is definitely going to be my go to now. The smell as everybody pointed out is bad, well yah cause it’s straight up chemical."
4,"This worked. It really did. I used a lot more powder than I thought I would need for just my legs, and it took a lot more time to mix it to the right consistency. It only slightly burned, and I coped with the smell by holding my breath the entire time I was using this. It reeks of metallic and sulfur and I still gag thinking about the smell weeks later. It didn't last as long as I was hoping, but it still beats having to use a razor every night!"
4,"Great product for what it’s made for. Takes the hair away super fast! Smells like rotten eggs (or so I’m told... I have COVID so idk). Was good on semi sensitive places... it is for the face and I’m sure it’d be great for it. Be extremely careful putting it on your goods ;) maybe have someone help you lol as far as moisturizing, it made me super soft but also has a weird film to it. DEFINITELY FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS. Except for mixing... I had to add a little more water than what it wants. But I don’t know how to get a heaping spoonful of water. (It says to add a heaping spoonful of powder and equal amount of water lol) oh also, my hair is growing back like 4 days after spending all that time doing it. So a lot of work for it to last a few days..."
4,"Ok so first off let’s talk about the positives. The product works fantastic. It removed all my hair in 7 minutes with no burning or stinging and left my skin suuuper soft. So it does its job and it does it well I think that if you hate shaving or wanna use this for the “sensitive areas” i think it works perfectly and for under 5 dollars I can’t really complain.That being said let’s talk about the stench. If you have a sensitive nose or just cannot stand the smell of sulfur specifically I would suggest the “fragrant” version in the gold can by the same brand Because To be honest, It smells like rotten eggs and ass at the same time. However but the smell doesn’t stick around the way nair does and I don’t personally find as unbearable. You do have to clean up well after you use this because any product left around on anything is gonna leave that faint stanky egg smell in your bathroom so I would recommend doing it in the bathtub. Overall I will definitely be using this again all I had to do was apply and wipe!"
4,"works perfectly, it just tarnished all my jewelry and including my tub and shower."
4,"Word of warning take off any rings or metal. It will instantly  tarnish. Otherwise it  worked amazing and my legs  were so smooth. Do not put on privates or near it will burn. Facial hair, legs, arms and back hair worked wonders on me and roomie."
4,It smells really bad.. But is good at his porpouse which is remove the hair.
4,awww sooki sooki now why did i have to see this AFTER purchasing a 70$ Phillips Body shaver. This stuff is absolute magic like it says. Tested the first day on my right thigh. HORRIBLE eggy smell but worth it. I suggest burning a candle and some paper towel. Bleach for any surfaces you might get it on and you’ll be absolutely fine. But i’ll tell you my thigh looked and felt as if it never had any hair to begin with. Used some more two days later for my man parts and butt and man oh man it is baby smooth. MAKE sure not to scrub tho bc i did it on my balls and now i have what feels like only a very mild razor burn but that’s probably my fault. I did have a small bump like thingy that bled on my pubic region but it didn’t burn or anything don’t know what that was. Also used on my chest wasn’t as effective but maybe it’s bc the batch i made for that was a bit thin. Other than that this stuff is amazing; I have coarse hair. Other than the smell just heed warnings and you’ll be as smooth as ever without the effects of shaving!!
4,"Smells like rotten eggs for awhile, so use ahead of time, but it work pretty good!"
4,Not bad
4,"bruh this stuff smells so bad. it filled my whole house with the smell of it it was not pleasant at all. but once you get past the smell, it actually works pretty good and it takes a while for my hair to grow back, but that could just be how my body hair grows back idrk."
4,"This stuff definitely works.Smells like rotten eggs. It says it is made for beards, but I used it in my bikini area (external only) and it worked perfectly.I almost left it on too long because it seemed like it would have caused some kind of reaction if left on any longer. I think I let it sit for 4-5 mins.The hair wipes away really easily and left the area completely bare and smooth."
4,"Bruh! I’m never shaving my legs again. Removed ALL hair, didn’t break out the way I do with nair. Smells just like nair but my husband says it makes our whole bathroom and bedroom smell putrid.Worked better on a flat surface like my legs than a cranny-y surface like my armpits. Inner thigh high grew out less prickly than usual.Mid twenties female."
4,"I would highly suggest this product,in an unscented version, which I believe they do have.. I will purchase the unscented next time... It works like the name says ""magic"""
4,"Works great, made my whole apartment smell like rotten eggs for 2 days (i lit candles, scentsys, incents, opened door/windows, and sprayed all around. Easy to apply besides the back of my thighs. I recommend."
4,(I’m a woman that used this on her legs lol) The smell wasn’t bad at first but definitely got worse as it stayed on. Did it’s job though! Felt like my hair didn’t grow back as fast compared to shaving. I did get a few razor bumps but my skin is also ultra sensitive. My skin was kind of dry but lotion did the trick after.
4,I thought people would exaggerate about the smell but omggggg it smells soooooo badddddddd be ready to light up 1000 scented candles and spray a lot of perfume
4,"Soooo yes I saw this on tiktok!!! And had to buy it to test out.Like many have said.Please do this in a open area it smells so bad.. so yeah do that, also once your done and your smooth. Lotion yourself up my skin felt so dry after I showered.Measure right I added to much water one batch was watery."
4,Ok I seen this product on TikTok and thought I would try it works really well was pleased with the results it works so good that you better make sure you only get it in the places you want the hair gone another tip don’t reapply if you missed some spot I did and got a awful burning feeling had to rise immediately if you get a burning with the first coat remove it maybe to strong or add water now the worst part of this product the SMELL!!!!! Picture a dozen rotten eggs that’s what it smells like but if you get past that it work’s awesome
4,"It works, especially on course hair. I have to go over a bit with a razor for finer hair recommendation getting sensitive version for the peri area as it is a bit harsh there. Smells awful but i like the overall effect of smoothness."
4,"Bought this for myself (not a man)  works , but has a VERY strong smell that lingers for a long time.  I kind of tingles/burns while on.  And the smell is SO BAD and STRONG but but this stuff works great!"
4,Does what it says but the smell is just not worth it to me. It smells like a rotting skunk.
4,"You aren’t getting it for the moisture. You are getting it for the smooth finish it will you 🐈 it works well, but it didn’t take everything off, but much better than shaving."
4,"It is a good product in that it does what it says, to me it is the powder form of Nair. I’ve seen other types but I have only tried this one and the smell is horrible. It’s very putrid. I tried in the morning and when my husband got home in the afternoon he asked me what the smell was. It took a while for the smell to completely dissipate. If smell doesn’t bother you and you’re looking for a gentler version of Nair this is your product. You do get a lot of product for the price that has to be a bonus!"
4,"This smells horrible, my children accused my of lighting a rotten egg fire in the house. But if TikTok made you buy this like me LOL ..... you will for sure have smooth legs, I would not recommend the lady beard no matter what you have seen on TikTok, the chemical burn is not worth it people!"
4,This works great. Better than nair however you have to get past the smell. It made my bathroom smell like eggs for a few days. A candle couldn’t even get the smell out.
4,Product works amazing but DO IT OUTSIDE! It smells horrid!!! Seriously... no vents or fans will get the smell out. It took all day.Works great though lol
4,"I love this product! Shaving is awful, especially for a pregnant woman. However in the summer time it’s still needed. The SMELL is awful! But it is worth it! Mix your product and apply it, leave it for 5-10 minutes. Use a rag and warm water to remove. I suggest scrubbing the surface with a rag while in the shower. And then using soap to be sure it is all removed. It is not as close as a shave with a razor, but you can use this and go a couple of days without shaving. My face is too sensitive for it. It leaves my skin red and dry for days. But overall 4/5 much better then shaving!"
4,I didnt like how horrible it smelled. Smells like straight rotten eggs. I have never been so happy in my life thi.. It worked amazing. Bye bye razors. My skin feels so soft. Maybe a little itchy but th ty s after it drys
4,it smells like rotten eggs ... once you get past that you have nice legs 💖
4,It worked great and took off the unwanted hair but the smell was a little too pungent.
4,"This stuff really works I tried it on my arms wow , the only thing is that smell is really really strong, my husband  kept telling me to get out of the room what's that smell. Other than that the product works just like it says it removes all the hair I just recommend doing it somewhere very well ventilated."
4,"The scent is kind of bad but the brand does have a unscented kind that'sreally good. Also if you don't want to mix a powder there's also a cream that's works good.. Just make sure you wear gloves, don't leave it on for too long, and if you're using on your head and have psoriasis it's going to burn like hell. Other than that it is a good product."
4,"Product does what it says it will do. What it doesn't say it will do is: dry out skin, and leave it smelling quite disgusting. BUT I didn't buy it for those reasons. It removes hair. My tip- if using it on your legs, wash it off with a wash cloth. Directions say rinse with water, but that didn't work. Got out of the shower and had dried stuff on my legs yet. Actually like this better than other 'hair removing' products. (minus the smell....pungent)"
4,It works great on my legs but I tried this on my armpit and it burn my skin so I like it for my legs meanly I mean I would buy it again but this one isn’t for Sensitive skin
4,"Start off by saying I didn't listen and used it on my legs lol. I bought the aloe version first and it worked decently well, with some stray hairs left behind.  It was not available when I went to reorder, so I went for the extra strength to see the difference. It was incredibly well. However, there are positives and negatives to bothAloe version:-works decently with some spotting-smells not to horrible, definitely manageable-a bit more expensive-no irritationExtra Strength:-smells like you lost 10 easter eggs somewhere in your bathroom for a year-slight irritation that goes away after about 20 min (nothing crazy)-took every hair off for me-cheaper than the previous versionConclusion:This product definitely works and I will continue using it. The smell of the extra strength is to much for me so I will reserve it for when I really need every hair gone. I will most definitely continue to use the aloe version."
4,it work to remove most the hair but i haven't wanted to use it again because it smells so strong like sulfur.
4,Bought for my teen daughter to use as she requested to try it. Worked well enough but said she should’ve used a little more to get hair completely off. She only did half of her thigh down to ankle on both legs and used over half of the can. The only downside is the smell;  air out the house when done lol.
4,"It works, kinda messy but it worked on my legs, they are super smooth."
4,"It worked great for my legs. I saw this on a tiktok video. Overall a great product for getting rid of hair. Note that if you don't want your entire house to smell like rotten eggs for a couple hours I wouldn't recommend 😬 I had the bathroom door closed, the vent on and the window open. My family had a good laugh and just said I ate too much spicy food last night 🤣. I will definitely look into getting the light scented ones."
4,"i used this for my armpits, legs, and other areas. I love this for areas where I get more razor burn. I think it’s a little messy and the smell is disgusting! Like rotten egg farts. I also feel like it’s more work to do this than to just shave in the shower."
4,Works great. Smells horrible
4,"Smells horrible, and flakes all over the floor when dried. It worked about 80% well, still have a few hairs to go over. Not bad for the price if you can withstand the odor, it also burns a bit when it’s drying."
4,The smell is terrible but love the product!
4,"This product STINKS for DAYS. The worst smelling this out there 😂 but it sure is wonderful at hair removal!! I used it on my legs and I am day 3 with no pricklies! Will buy again, but make sure you don’t do it the night before an event, give the smell a day to completely fade 😅"
4,"I used it for my legs! It works amazing, my legs are smooth as can be. No rash which is a plus. The down of it is my entire family noticed the smell right away. They didn't know I was applying it and they all agreed it smelled like ""rotten eggs"". I don't mind it so I will continue using."
4,"This products works great! You have to add a little less water than what is recommended. It does burn just a bit, but it’s not too bad! It does smell AWFUL. Like my whole house smelt for hours."
4,"Okay guys!! So I’ve seen this on tik tok, and I HATE shaving my lady parts. I’ve actually been debating on rather or not to get a Brazilian, but I’m so so glad I found this product. It STINKS like rotten eggs, but I can handle it because it’s worth it. It’s been probably a month since I shaved down there, and I was worried this wouldn’t work because of it. Well I was WRONG! It got most of my hair, and I’m definitely buying more of this stuff. I did have to shave some parts that were you know too close for comfort, but that’s fine with me because it only took me 5 minutes for all of the hair to be gone! Plus I have a young daughter and the only way I can shower is if she’s with me, so thank goodness for this product. It’s a MUST HAVE. Also forgot to mention, it does burn a little, but only in a few areas"
4,Love this product but it made my house smell like rotten eggs. Works great! Just smell is horrible. Would buy again if they fixed the smell.
4,"You may not like the scene though, it's relatively strong."
4,"I want to start by saying I don't usually like using products from big companies, ESPECIALLY ones like J & J, but I have to admit when my skin loves a product. I was recently on vacation visiting my mom and forgot my moisturizer and had to use hers. I was very nervous bc I have very sensitive skin with rosacea that usually gets triggered by products like this and containing fragrance. I also have hormonal acne around my monthly that was around this same time, so my skin was angry to begin. I feel like someone reading this may think I'm lying when I say my skin immediately, IMMEDIATELY perked up with first use. I couldn't believe over the following week when my skin is usually at its worse, it looked better than it had in years. My 40 yo skin was transformed that week to supple, firmer looking skin that it hadn't been since my 20s(and I've always looked good 'for my age'). I wish it weren't true, but I had to come home and order it right away. I can't imagine my life without it now. Took a star away for being owned by evil and containing fragrance, though I have to admit the fragrance isn't overpowering at all and is quite pleasant. I can see from the ingredients list it could bother some people, so it's not for everyone."
4,Like: I like it how it keep my face moisturize for the whole day.Dislike: every time I use it I feel my skin heating warm. Good thing there’s no breakout.
4,Have been using this regulary everyday. For some reason other brands that I tried never worked for me. The only down side is the cost but the quality of the product is very nice
4,I like that it moisturizes without being oily.
4,This product has  too much scent in it however good Moisturizing ability
4,Perhaps not for my type of skin. Will continue to use it but it does not absorb as I would like for it just sits on the skin...and is a bit too greasy.
4,"Started using this night gel for past several months. Having very oily skin, this has been really good. My skin is clearer. I now also use the day gel, eye gel and SPF gel. I like that it doesn't have much of a scent. Will buy again."
4,Like: prevent face from dehydrating.Dislike: cream make face sticky
4,"I love how watery, cool and comforting it feels to put this on! It's always been difficult finding products for my extremely sensitive skin, so it's nice not to have my face feel irritated for w/e reason for once!"
4,Good but for some reason I gives me acne even though I didn’t have any when I started using it
4,"I have veryyy oily skin and this moisturizer is recommended to people with oily skin all the time so I thought I’d give it a try. I must admit it is pretty good and it leaves your skin really smooth, soft, and well moisturized. I don’t know if it’s just me and my skin but after a couple of minutes it makes my skin even more oily like super (I could probably fry some chicken with it😭) so if you’re someone like me who has really oily skin I don’t think I would really recommend this."
4,Love how moisturizing this product is but could do with out the blue tint… my skin seems to be sensitive to this… but I just have sensitive skin… I know friends who use it and have such a beautiful glow all day long after use! Seems fine just not for me… I enjoy cerave moisturizing products much better.
4,I really liked the description of this gel I have sensitive skin and no scent I can smell  but first time I've ever used it and I took some out and so watery spilled a lot right in the sink because I like it trying to be careful but did it again not as much since I really like it so will figure it out it was this or another gel I used but that was a little to thick for me I just wish came in bigger size I think that would have helped but will keep using it because I like gels and light lotions not creams
4,Lightweight and perfect for summer.  No perfumes or smell.
4,"I love this product! It’s light and soaks in right away. Most face creams sit on your skin, only to sweat off later. This soaks in and hydrates very well! I use it on sunburns and it glides on the skin. No scent, so nothing to bother sensitive skin.One problem is with this particular container, the consistency is different than it normally is. It’s more creamy and thicker instead of more of a gel consistency like the previous one. I hope they haven’t changed the formula!"
4,"This is a good product. Unfortunately the lid was not tight during shipping and most of the product had leaked out before I opened the package which made unboxing a mess. After the cleanup, things got back to normal. I like this product and it does what it says it does. My skin feels much better after use. I will buy this again."
4,very moisturizing and calming for the skin but the scent is very strong when you first apply but it wears off pretty quickly.
4,Good moisturizer cream for sensitive skin and suitable for all seasons. Although it doesn't have a strong smell but suits me and my wife's skin. We just love it
4,"Feels great, not as creamy and thin as I thought it would be , kinda thick which works for night product. The scent is minimal , my skin feels good after wearing it. The only downfall is the amount of product feels like so little ."
4,"I don’t know why it had to be so heavily perfumed but I wish it wasn’t. Otherwise, it has a good value and you get a lot for the price. Plus, it does a great job at moisturizing so a little goes a long way. I put it on every night and my skin feels plump and hydrated in the morning. So far it hasn’t made my skin break out either which is another big plus."
4,Love it
4,I bought this after reading an article about combination skin. My forehead is greasy but my cheeks and chin are dry. This did work great to give my skin some moisture but it’s not a moisturizer. I still needed to wear a moisturizer on top of it. But it did help. Hope this helps.
4,"I was not expecting too much, but I’m happy to order it. I have combination skin type it moisturizes, calms acne!  is light and is great for summer time. I think its too light for Winter. though. The only thing I didn’t like it came open..."
4,Been really liking this my face is so soft with it
4,"I really liked this moisturizer, my face breaks out easily and is super sensitive but this moisturizer really didn’t break my face out at all and helped me clear a little bit of my acne. I recommend this for anyone who is looking for a moisturizer to help extremely dry skin on the face!"
4,Great deal on a good product
4,"My husband really likes this lotion, as he has combination skin; but for my sensitive skin, it made me have breakouts, which I never experienced with Neutrogena's water gel lotion."
4,"Liked that it was easy to spread although it’s thinner than I’d like, so when the jar tips over, the cream goes into the cover. Not a big deal but xcept when traveling. Seems to moisturize well."
4,For people with skin that breaks out with the use of cream moisturizers this is a god send.  It helps with my wrinkles. The moisturizer dries quickly.  I wish the container was a bit bigger so it would last a month.  Reasonably priced.
4,"Very moisturizing, has a cooling, watery feeling, which I like. Very gentle and soothing."
4,It's very hydrating but I would prefer a non-fragrance as it was a little strong for my taste.
4,"This has become my favorite. Absorbs well, baby soft skin, keeps skin well moisturise. I have used the ordinary product before this and I can bet this works really well for me. I have dead dry skin.PS - this is a genuine review, I wasn't paid."
4,"When I use this product, I feel my skin is looking more Healthy and Glowing!"
4,The product packaging isnt sealed and it was a bit damaged so I was a little worried that it had been opened. The container and the inside of it looked fine so it didn't bother me too much.As for the product itself I have nothing but good things to say. I love the lightness of it and it feels refreshing. Smell isn't overwhelming. You don't need much to apply on your face.
4,"Easy to apply, non-greasy on your fingers when applying or on your face.  I have seen a difference in the texture of my face.  Bought a second one to continue using."
4,This is a good cream which doesn't leave any greasy thing behind
4,Left my skin feeling very moisturized.
4,"I was looking for an oil free, night time moisturizer and this was recommended on a lot of skin care top tens. So far I'm digging it! Dries down quickly, skin feels smooth after application and skin texture in the morning is A1. Only con is the scent...not terrible but with my supersonic nose I will go with the scent free option if I order again. I also use it over like three other acids in my regimen with no irritation."
4,good moisturizer
4,"I like this moisturizer a lot and use it frequently so I thought I would restock on amazon. However, the packaging had no tape and looked like it has been opened so I returned it. I wish it would come sealed so that I would feel safe using it"
4,It works great just like the serum.. The combination is better with the serum
4,The cream is very light and refreshing. My skin absorbs it well. I prefer the product didn’t have any fragrance since I am allergic to perfume. The scent is mild but I prefer no sense. But overall I like the product.
4,My skin is very dry and this works great for a moisturizer before bed.  I do like the cream better than the water though.
4,"The product is good, but for some reason it causes me acne. Maybe it is not for all skin types"
4,Skin feels soft and fresh
4,"I like this product. When I feel dry, it really moisturizing my face."
4,"I am so happy with the results of this moisturizer!Previously, I was using Aveeno face moisturizer and after realizing it wasn't really doing a good job of moisturizing my skin, I did some research and decided to go with this Neutrogena moisturizer.I am very happy with it! I have very sensitive skin but have not had any sort of reaction to this. I love the sent, not overly perfume-y, but a nice fresh smelling sent. I have noticed a great improvement to my skin since using it. It is so much softer now! My skin feels amazing when I apply this lotion. I am also happy with the price and the product lasts a long time. A little goes a long way. I have been using it twice a day every day, for about and month and a 1/2 and I am only about 1/2 way through the jar.The only reason I gave this 4 star in stead of a 5/5 is because there is no SPF in the moisturizer, which I feel is very important to have in a face moisturizer. But otherwise so happy with this product!"
4,I used this for my Face. I Love the way it melts right in... doesn't end up in my eye's. I do see a difference after only a week. Ordered two more & it is reasonably priced. Keep the PRICE the same & you will have a continuous customer. My friend told me about this product. I'm 70 now & need moisturizer
4,"So I have complicated thoughts about this moisturizer. I really liked the texture and the cooling feeling it gave, especially under my eyes. I'm not sure, however, it is a true moisturizer. It honestly felt more like an hyaluronic acid serum to me. I usually had to put on a regular moisturizer over it. That being said, I really liked it for that purpose. My skin felt bouncy and fresh after using it. It is a tad expensive for the size, I think I'd repurchase but from Costco next time."
4,This product gives you moisture without a greasy sticky feeling. I have seen an improvement in my skin texture.
4,"After I wash my wash to get all the makeup and dirt and anything else that has accumulated on my face and neck, I pat it dry and then put this on my face, neck, back of my hands, and elbows. A little go a long way. I'm currently trying a Nutrogena hydro body lotion type item (forgot the exact name of it) to use on my hands, elbows, legs and feet. Like the facial one I am reviewing right now. It's amazing how quickly it's not wet after you apply it. My face looks and feels more healthy and youthful the next morning after my shower and makeup is on. You can definitely tell when I skip my nightly routine. I love it. My only wish is that there was more in the jar and with all beauty products I wish it was less expensive. It asked if it was good for sensitive skin. Idk. My skin isn't sensitive."
4,"Smooth silky, clean finish. Keeps skin hydrated. I use daily the day time version and night time moisturizer."
4,"I recently purchased this product because I was looking for moisturizer that was highly moisturizing for my skin as my skin was getting very dry. I really like this product it did moisturize my skin really well I use it twice daily, and I have seen great results in just a week. I would highly recommend getting this as it really moisturizes your skin well and should be used in your daily routine. The only thing that I did not like about this is the packaging, when I received the product the packaging was all damaged and that was the only downside that I can think of about this product. Overall a very great product, it smells really good when you apply this."
4,"I bought this cream for my son. He have oily skin. He loved it, this is his 3rd bottle and will definitely buy more . Very hydrating and soothing."
4,Love this. I keep it in fridge.  Nice and cooling!
4,Absorbs nicely. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Light fragrance. Add a serum if you want deeper hydration.
4,I love this moisturizer but i hate that neutrogena added dye and scent. Neutrogena should NOT advertise that this is perfume free because IT IS NOT. THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS PERFUME. I’ve been using this for a while now but might have to change because i find the perfume irritates my skin a bit. Please switch it back neutrogena!!!
4,I really liked this! Helps really good!!
4,"when i first tried it i felt a burning sensation but that was likely because my skin was irritated from something else because now i no longer have that issue, smells REALLY good as well."
4,Works great as a night cream and a bit thicker than the water gel face moisturizer. I prefer the water gel. This will make me break out after awhile if used every night.
4,I really loved the moisturizer and the face wash but the moisturizer is weird lol
4,"Daughter likes it, little pricey for the amount"
4,"I am 84 years old so I did not expect miracles, however after using this product for one week I found my skin not as dry and more youthful looking. As for the wrinkles they are thereto stay but seem to be less prominent."
4,"It has no small, it spreads easily. Great for the skin. I recommend this product because it’s amazing."
4,"I like this alot, it creates a nice barrier on your skin so really good to use before putting on makeup, I have combination skin and this hydrates really well, my skin is also sensitive to perfumes but this hasn't caused acne at all and smells fresh. the only negative is it did cause my nose to peel the first week, not sure why.. but overall really like it and will continue to use."
4,Good for daily use.
4,Won't need to buy this as often as they recommend. Great investment!!
4,"I plan on buying it again after I finish the first container. I do not have sensitive skin, but I do struggle with acne. lovely on the face: cooling and hydrating. Soaks in a bit too much, as my face feels like it needs a second coat of hydration but I use an spf moisturizer regardless so it works perfectly. Hasn't bothered my acne at all, If anything it's helped the healing process. Little goes a long way."
4,"The texture is great and it absorbs into your skin so fast. But if you have sensitive skin be careful - this is the SCENTED formula, which can sting. If I had known there was a fragrance free version before buying I would have gotten that one :/ just hoping my skin can learn to tolerate this or I may have to toss it. At least the smell is nice."
4,This product is very soothing and light. My skin often gets very dry especially during winter season and this hydro boost moisturizer sure fixes that. I highly recommend.
4,"This moisturizer is nice. However, I am not a big fan of this type of smell. Some people might find the scent of this product is wonderful, but I am not a fan of any type of smell in moisturizer. I like Neutrogena and I trust their products. Like I said earlier, it functions very well, the texture is very thick so you won't need to apply a lot at once. I would've given them five stars if they did not have a scent in this product. Besides the scent, I think this is a good moisturizer, but if I were you, I would just buy Nivea cream instead. It has more portions, and more importantly, it is cheaper."
4,"I want to love this product, but I think my skin is just too dry. It’s super lightweight and doesn’t make my face feel oily so that’s a plus."
4,Moisturizes nicely. Goes on nicely. Nice texture & feeling
4,Trying several new moisturisers.  This is high on my list.  Feels wonderful and a good price.
4,Love the moisture but not the scent.
4,"I really like this stuff. It’s different than a moisturizer in that it is a thin, gel like substance and a little goes a long way.Normally I have dry skin around my nose, but this stuff gets rid of it completely, making makeup look much nicer. It makes my skin feel soft a dewy. I would not recommend putting this on right before wearing foundation/powder. It needs to be completely dry, otherwise the makeup doesn’t sit right.I was reallly disappointed though when I opened the jar and noticed a strong perfume. The smell is amazing, but I feel like it’s unnecessary for a moisturizer to smell good and scents can be harsh on those with sensitive skin, although (after using this for a week, daily) I haven’t noticed any unusual sensitivity or more acne. If perfumes don’t bother your skin and you need something more from a moisturizer, I recommend this stuff!"
4,Very good for my dry skin. I use twice a day and it lasts me about a month-2
4,"For my dry/combination skin, this is a perfect summer moisturizer. I don't need much in the summer, but in the dry winters, I use this and a thicker moisturizer on top.ALSO, if you have a Costco membership, it's a lot cheaper there so I started getting mines from there."
4,"This fragrance free, lightweight moisturizer feels good in my sensitive skin. I'm prone to cystic acne and found that gel moisturizers work well. I haven't noticed any changes in tone or fine lines after 2 weeks of use but we'll see."
4,My skin is very picky and i have not been able to find a moisturizer to help my skin in winter but also not break my skin out. I have combo skin and usually moisturizers break meOut. This was a long shot but i honestly saw results the first week. Face feels and looks 100 times better than usual. My routine is wipe with water upon wake and sleep and put this on right after.That’s it. I love the fresh scent and the fact i dont have to put much on to get an effect. I’m impressed and will continue to use!! :)  i feel like my face looks fresher and more awake. Love it so far!
4,Nice moisturizer for dry skin
4,I Have only had this for 24 hours so I will have to update later. So far this has left my skin super  soft and smooth I have been breaking out really bad and I have started a new skincare regimen. This product was highly requested and so far I love it. I have oily skin around my nose so though it is very moisturizing it leaves my face feeling fresh. I thought the container looked pretty small but it is a good amount of product
4,"I would recommend getting the fragrance free version of this product instead. I didn't really like the smell, but that is the only negative. Overall is moisturizes really well and contains great ingredients."
4,The smell is nice. It is moisturizing. I did have some dryness still around my t zone as the weather changed.
4,"When I got my package, it looked like the box has been through a WW2, and somebody opened it couple times. Also the Gel container itself, when I opened the lead, didn't have any plastic or some other second protection. Maybe that is how it's supposed to be, but it sure does look suspicious. I don't have any complaints with the products itself, its good!"
4,"So I likeIt - but very light and not very good  moisturizer for winter ( and I’m in Florida , so that says a lot )Good for summer!! Not irritating, but I wasn’t sure how it got such amazing reviews"
4,"This did not work for my face. It caused a breakout; Honestly, most things do. I now use it on my hands to treat the dryness from hand washing and sanitizer, and it makes them feel great. I enjoy the clean scent."
4,My skin was looking and getting so dry. It helps to keep my skin softer especially when wearing a face mask to 8+ hours.
4,Freshwater cold feeling
4,Works ok
4,"Smells nice, not good for dry skin"
4,"I like this product and kept ordering this is the 3 or 4 time. But this time the package like a returned product that had been opened and tried. I didn't want to take the time to return but I am a little less happy. So, I took 1 star off."
4,Love this moisturizer for my oily skin. Makes my face feel smooth and supple
4,"If you want a moisturizer that is light, airy and low maintenance then this is for you.  I recommended this to a coworker who is in her 20’s since it seems perfect for someone that need a lot of additional bells and whistles.For someone with the occasional long night that leaves dark circles or a few laugh lines forming I felt this didn’t do enough for me.  I’m moving back to a creamier, more fully-loaded creme.Also the scent can sometimes come off a twinge like burnt hair.  I smelt it occasionally, probably when I put a bit too much on, but I didn’t bother my boyfriend at all..."
4,Light and gets absorbed fast. Good for oily skin
4,"Scent was too strong for my sensitive skin. Didn't care for the feel of the product, didn't moisture my dry face as I was hoping.  Not sellers fault, they did great shipping it out. I should have investigated prior to buying. B"
4,"Plumps way those fine lines while it’s on, not that moisturizing though, good for oily skin, dried fast, scent is a little strong. Don’t get it in your eyes though. tatcha water cream is just more moisturizing and balanced if you have combination skin, I was hoping it was the same for less, it’s not but the closest I have tried so still a good value if you are on a budget"
4,I like lotion better
4,My dermatologist recommended this product. Love it!
4,This product was pretty good. I have combination skin so it worked ok for me. I would say this is more for oily skin people since it is pretty light weight.
4,Wish it came in bigger size
4,"This moisturizer is okay. It is moisturizing enough but it’s nothing to write home about.  Also, it has a fairly strong scent. The scent is not unpleasant but I just prefer my skincare to not have fragrance. I wouldn’t buy this product again."
4,Not ideal to use in az summer heat. Walk outside and instantly melting. Otherwise great feel on face
4,"I love the product, as far as moisturizing skin goes. However, the perfume scent is a deal breaker for future purchases. Why is this scented, Neutrogena?! I'm using the remainder of the container on my feet, which works well. It's still difficult to get the scent of my hands after applying to the feet, however. Anyone know of an equivalent product that is unscented?"
4,"The only moisturizer that I trust! It’s so light on your skin, yet keeps my skin silky all day. And I think I’m addicted to the scent."
4,good for sensitive and oily skin
4,"The immediate hydration you feel applying this moisturizer is fantastic. My only complaint is the time that hydration lasts. It may we’ll be my dry skin is sucking it up quickly, but the moisture seems to fade rather quickly."
4,If you like light weight moisturizers this is great and doesnt leave you feeling sticky or looking like you let elmers glue dry on your face like I feel with the elf moisturizer. If you prefer heavier night creams like the cerave skin renewing moisturizer then you might not like how lightweight this is.
4,"I have acne prone skin and this seemed to calm it down a little. My sister did not like the scent. I was okay with it, but prefer unscented over scented. This jar was shared between my sister and I and it lasted us 1 month only. It came without any seal, so the moisturizer got on the lid. I do not know if there was suppose to be a seal, but I was expecting it to have one or at least one of those skinny second lids that some moisturizers have (like the E.L.F. Holy Hydration)."
4,I don’t think it gives a bunch of long term benefits but it’s super hydrating and I love it
4,Good product at affordable price.I order for 02. One came with box seal.The other one without box seal
4,"It’s a really good moisturizer, however I started noticing flare-ups. I read the bottle and even though this item is listed as fragrance free, fragrance is listed as one of the ingredients."
4,I was looking for a moisturizing but lightweight product and finally gave in to this one as a dupe for Laneige. It works perfectly for me! Also it’s very refreshing 😊
4,"I was disappointed to find that I could not use this product. It was fine at the start, feels good, leaves my skin smooth and well hydrated. Halfway through the jar, after I'd ordered a second jar, I began to have a strong allergic reaction to the scent which is pretty overpowering. If you don't have a problem with scents, you'll love this. I ended up using the rest of what I had, and the new jar, as a body lotion and it's great - a little expensive for a body lotion but it is a super-hydrator."
4,"I’m loving this! I have very dry skin and this seems to do the trick. Lightweight and very moisturizing. On the other hand, I don’t care for the perfumed scent."
4,It definitely helps my skin soak up and retain moisture. I have sensitive skin and it didn't bother it at all.
4,Great light moisturizer
4,Gave as Gift with other neutrogena products
4,"I bought this to replace my body shop vitamin E daily moisturizer and it has been working really well, if not better on my skin. I have combination (and sensitive) skin. I use this as my day time moisturizer and it has worked really well to hydrate my skin without leaving me oily (despite this summer heat)!  For the price, I can't believe that this works so well."
4,"The only thing I would improve is to make a fragrance free version. It feels great on the skin. very moisturizing, yet light."
4,Great but too pricy
4,"Its a nice smelling, light and non oily moisturizer for dry skin."
4,I love that this moisturizer has no greasy residue at all but it does really burn when you first put it on and I don’t consider myself to have sensitive skin.
4,"Really like this product, wish price were more competitive."
4,"So, it made me have a ""skin purge"". It took a little over a month for my skin to adjust, but now it leaves my skin feeling soft. I have super clear skin that is less textured. It may not be the best for sensitive skin. It may be a good idea to ease into it so your skin doesn't break out."
4,"Great, lightweight moisturizer. I have combination skin that tends to be oily and this helps keeps me moisturized without feeling heavy. I use it every morning."
4,"This product has no scent and works good, but the cream version works great. This one is a blue color and stings slightly around the eyes if I put too much. I prefer the Hydroboost cream version of this product because it is for very dry skin and works better for me."
4,It spilled when i opened but besides that its good
4,"Great for rough sensitive skin. I usually have problems with the scents, but the scent doesn’t last once it’s on your face. I was experiencing changes to my skin with rough patches that would return after exfoliating. This has cleared it right up. Wish they would have sealed the package, it’s the only reason I gave it a 4. Makes you wonder if it’s legit, apparently others have also noticed. I spilled 1/4 of it out while opening because there was no inner seal. Otherwise I love it!!!"
4,Great for sensitive skin. Moisturizing but great for humid hot weather of Texas. I will rebuy for size and price.
4,I usually spend a lot on hyaluronic serums. I saw this one In a magazine article and decided to try. It’s very cooling and refreshing. Definitely a great find.
4,Sometimes my skin gets sensitive. When it is and if I put this on my skin then the skin gets kind of tingling. But other than that good quality and good price. Its moisturizing is pretty awesome. I put this on in the morning and night. Even here is dry area but I think it is enough.
4,"I actually liked the cream, it doesn't feel sticky, it is light and absorbs quickly, maybe seriously interesting and it would be good if I had sunscreen, and in my opinion the package is very large for the actual amount of cream"
4,"I love this cream! I had the feeling of thick, oily, heavy, greasy moisturizers on my face so, to be honest, it's very hard for me to find any that I would even like to put on my face. This moisturizer is very nice, literally like putting water on my face, feels cold when I put it on, and makes my face hydrated without feeling greasy or heavy, I love it. That being said, I'm not sure if this is really moisturizing my face because of its light consistency, or at least not enough. I still really like this cream but I think it really depends on what you are looking for and what adapts based on your skin type. This would favor more for those who have oily skin."
4,"I really like Neutrogena products but for me as a guy, it made my face feel like clammy hands so I gave this product 4 Stars because of the Brand Name, it has a pleasant scent and it's very moisturizing, it's very easy to use and massages to the face and neck very nicely, it also washes off the hands with little effort. The product didn't work for me but I still recommend Neutrogena Products, I trust the Brand name and I will keep buying their Brand products I currently use."
4,"This smells and feels great, however, after about 6 months of use, it’s started to lose its ability to moisturize for my skin. I’m not sure why this has happened and I want to keep using it but it just isn’t working for me anymore."
4,Great smell and it does a decent job moisturizing a little goes a long way
4,"The Neutrogena Hydro Boost line has been great for my skin. I use the serum and moisturizer. It’s the only moisturizer I’ve tried that doesn’t leave a top layer of film/grease. It actually absorbs completely, softens, and makes my skin less oily, thus also helping with my fungal acne too. It also doesn’t break me out. Other moisturizers leave a film and give me whiteheads.It’s a great line of products, and Amazon has made it more affordable with subscribe and save. I pay around $13 for each rather than $18 at Walmart."
4,"Excellent for asorbtion, not thick and hasn't clogged pores"
4,"Been using this product for a week now, so far I feel better about my face texture. My skin type is oily, so is not like i will stop being oily but it feel way better than when i didn't use moisturizer. Also it doesn't clog my pores and I have open pores. Been using it with a cleaser from another brand. Will update after a month.Update: I get oily after several hours. It doesn't bother me but I wish I didn't get that oily."
4,"I had been hearing about hyaluronic acid, and thought I would try it out.  I usually try to avoid the hype as I always go back to Olay Regenerist.  I will use the remainder and think it is okay, but not enough for my needs/skin.  I don't have any negative feelings about it and would recommend trying as it may be just what you are looking for your skin regimen.  It is light, dewey feeling, and absorbs well into the skin.  I do not have sensitive skin and had no issues.UPDATE 8/20/21:  After posting above review, I finished the contents and then purchased Hydro Boost for extra-dry skin which did not feel any more hydrating to me than the original.  After having completely used the original, I then changed my mind as I look at my skin and see that it works as well or better than the creams I have been using.  It feels light on the skin and use it to prepare my face for makeup (like a primer).  My skin looks fairly well for a woman in her mid-60's.  Some do not believe me when I tell them my age.  I am not boasting, but do try to take care of myself.  I do not use liquid foundation any more and only use eye shadow, blush, mascara, and PÜR 4-in-1 Pressed Powder Mineral Foundation with Concealer.  Also, a little bit goes a long way with this moisturizer and even though container may seem small, it will last a good amount of time.  The adage ""Less is more"" applies to Hydro Boost."
4,I really like this product! It’s very light on skin and it’s absorbs into your skin very quickly. Even though I LOVE the scent I wish it was fragrance free to decrease any sensitivity.
4,It’s not oily or sticky . Absorbs nicely but the smell is weird I don’t know if I like the essence or not . Overall it’s a big container so it’s worth and does the job of moisturizer
4,"I love the consistency of this, and you only need a tiny bit. It smells fabulous and it's very moisturizing! My only complaint is that my package wasn't sealed, and even when I opened the moisturizer, it didn't have the protective barrier on top that you usually take off before you use it. So it almost seems like it has been opened before. That is more a seller issue than a product issue so I'm not sure that I would buy from this seller again."
4,"The advertising on this page says this product is fragrance free but the product I received includes fragrance. I don't mind the fragrance but for people with sensitive noses or skin, this could be an issue. Otherwise I like the product. I layer it under my moisturizer and my skin does feel more hydrated and soft."
4,this stuff is great.  It leaves my skin so soft. Its a regular in my beauty regime now.
4,"Good product! Not as good as the Monat moisturizer I use, but I tried this out to see if I liked it because it’s cheaper. Sometimes it makes my skin tingle but it is nicely moisturizing!"
4,I have super sensitive skin... this stuff works well but I found it stopped working for me after a while of using... if I go back to it after a while of using something else it works again.. it’s strange... but this is a nice product and is same (when I bought it over a year ago) as the one in the store!
4,"PROS: I have extremely sensitive and dry skin and this moisturizer does not break me out. I think I saw some reviews about the smell, but I personally love the smell. I noticed after only a few weeks of use my acne (combined with cleanser) has cleared up completely. Another thing I have noticed is that it does wonders for my wrinkles.CONS: Sadly, i did not experience a ""quenching"" feeling after using. It did the job, and I do have very dry skin, but I will probably try something else when this runs out. For the price, I think it should it should moisturizer more."
4,I like this better than the $60 Estee Lauder one I had before.  It's a gel cream and glides on really smooth.  <3
4,"I have been using this moisturizer for years and it really is gentle and makes my skin feel soft and smooth. The packaging is a little bit deceiving as the container does not hold as much as one might expect… However, the product is great and I keep coming back for more so overall, I’m a happy customer. Hope that helps!"
4,Love the way it feels going on but not a heavy moisturizer.... if you have very dry skin you will need the heavier one.
4,I like this product. It is very refreshing and compared to the last skincare item I used this is very much less oily and it feels like water on my skin. I love how cooling it is!
4,It feels so wonderful on the face when you put it on and a little goes a long way with this. It is so soft and gentle on the face and neck. Only reason is 4 stars is because i don't know if it actually is doing anything for me but it definitely feels amazing and moisturizes my skin when i put it on
4,"This water-based moisturizer is a nice touch at the end of my skincare routine. Having oily skin, the texture is much thinner and doesn't tend to make my skin break out. I only use it at night though, because it is still a little heavy to put on pre-makeup."
4,Great product for skin. Best used a day after shaving to get the cooling/refreshing effect.
4,"I really love this stuff cause it's scentless and just makes your face feel fresh. The only qualm I have is that I have to put on some additional moisturizer. If I don't, my skin will start to dry up after a bit. My be because the air sucks where I live? I don't know."
4,"I have a combo of oily and dry skin and have been using this product for a few weeks now and currently loving it. I thought the fragrance was too strong when I smelled it in the jar, but it really doesn’t smell much/at after application. It absorbs into the skin quite quickly and doesn’t leave an oily feel!"
4,"It really keeps your skin hydrated  and soft , Goes well with the cleansing wash."
4,Love product
4,I had an appendectomy a few years ago which left horrible stretch marks on my abdomen. The bio oil  has significantly reduced the redness in the stretch marks. They are there don’t get me wrong but I feel more confident in how cleared up they have become. I myself apply right after the shower on skin that has been exfoliated. Would recommend and the scent is not bad at all.
4,So I apologize I didDidn’t take a before picture because I was so skeptical and after a weeks use I’ve actually started to notice a huge difference! It’s crazy because I’ve had these stretch marks for so long and using this within a week has decreased so much now I wish I had a before picture but this is the picture now so hopefully I can do an update in a few weeks… If you had seen before he would be awe
4,Nice
4,This product is amazing it doesn’t really have a scent and really moisturizes the skin while helping improve the looks.
4,It works but it smells like an old ladies bathroom.
4,It’s okay.
4,"I can see the improvement in my skin already! It is gentle and effective. Only points off is for the smell. It’s very perfumed and I’m sensitive to smells. I wish it were a little more subtle, however, as sensitive as I am I can tolerate it. Has greatly improved my post-pregnancy skin of my face and the stretch marks on my tummy."
4,Face body love thisoil
4,Been using for a few months now for my stretch marks. When I got pregnant I had got a lot of stretch marks during the 5- months & they’re definitely lighter than before. Love it
4,Very good absorption
4,"Feels nice on the skin, I love the scent. I wouldn't apply too much on the face if u have oily prone skin but on the other hand it's nice I usually apply it a night and it does the trick!"
4,"I use this on my face at night and not the day, because it causes breakouts if I have it on my face for the whole day.Definitely smells amazing, it has this very light and soothing smell. On the rest of my body it doesnt cause breakouts, and it makes my skin super super supple and soft, I love that aspect of this oil. Definitely buying it again but will be using it either carefully or not at all on my face"
4,Working well.
4,Good so fan and fast shipping
4,My partner loves it! It does make her skin soft and great to snuggle!
4,This is a great product for preventing new stretch marks and minimizing the appearance of existing ones. You have to be consistent with using daily in order to see the progress.
4,"Smells great and has not made my sensitive skin react negatively yet. I just need to get used to the feeling of an ""oil"" on my skin. It doesn't seem to dry to soak in over time. But I am excited to see the benefits and results."
4,"I can’t say it’s “helping” to “improve” the look of anything if I’m fully honest, but I just like the product. It does make my skin feel nice and soft, though the scar from my acl surgery and faint stretch marks haven’t changed to any noticeable degree so far. I’ve been using it about a month."
4,"Definitely great for dry skin,gives your face and body a nice healthy looking glow. Wont take your stretch marks away but will help with the appearance."
4,"I am 16W and this stuff so far is okay. I don’t see results, my stretch marks are darker (guess that’s expected). But I know my family had used this stuff and loved it! Hoping to get the same results they did. It does itch a little. No weird smell. Basic oil texture.I recommend using before bed. I tried during the day and it was uncomfortable for me because of the texture and itchiness."
4,Been using for 8 years. Get compliments from medical professionals about the softness of my skin.
4,"i love this product however i do not like the price amazon charges for this , i can get it at target or walmart for half the price"
4,"I really like the way it absorbs. I will probably use this until a few months after my pregnancy mainly because it feels really good on my sensitive,  stretching skin. .. the only downside is it smells terrible! It smells like old parfum blended inbaby oil. I would suggest also using a good body butter about 30 min. after applying.  This oil absorbs alot.. but this is what I need. Its important to moisturize all the layers of skin durring pregnancy"
4,"If you have sensitive skin i advised you to use it for the belly only and not the chest or boob part. You will end up breaking out with bumbs like acne. But overall not bad on the belly and its not oily like baby oil , the skin absorbs it."
4,"Love love love BioOil, apply every night to my belly to prevent stretch marks. For some reason this smaller size is more difficult to get the oil out of the top and have to shake more vigorously. Larger size containers have not had this issue"
4,"The oil great for itchy skin. It helped me a great deal while pregnant, I put it on my boobs, belly and hips. However it did not prevent stretch marks. By 8 months I had stretchmarks."
4,My daughter uses this to prevent stretch marks.I love it for my skin oil for my extremely dry skin
4,My wife used this product for both of our pregnancies. She started applying this starting 2nd trimester. She didn't have any visible stretch marks after deliveries. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for stretch marks treatment (especially if you want to avoid the stretch marks). I am not sure how it would work if you already have stretch marks.
4,"The product does work for my scars that I got after surgery but the smell is awful, it smells like fish oil and it’s thick so be sure to use a small amount in you hand to rub on your skin as a small amount covers a lot."
4,Started using it. Seems good so far. Need time to see the results.
4,"Very good for healing scars when used with a fresh wounded area. Also used starting around week 35 to prevent tearing during childbirth and it worked great! The scent is the only thing I would change about it, not a great smell."
4,Haven't seen signs of scars clearing up but it does moisturize my skin doesn't leave my hands oily. Maybe a little more time is needed
4,"It's different but I still went back to the individual oils. This seems like but dries quickly. To me it had an odd feel after putting on skin , but I'm very sensitive."
4,"Seems to be helping with my psoriasis, my flares haven’t been quite as bad since I started using this. It’s only been a few weeks but I don’t have as many scales. Still cracking open but not nearly as bad."
4,"Great to put on before bed. The scent is a bit strong. Yet, it does a great job!"
4,"This body oil absorbs quickly and is hydrating. I haven't been using it long enough to write a review about how effective this is on stretch marks, but I will update my review once I know. Hope this was helpful."
4,"I just started using this, so can’t really  comment on long term effects, but so far I like it. It smells nice, as moisturizes well.  It feels good on my skinUpdated  Pros  Smells good  Have seen some lightening of dark spots  Moisturizes well  Cons  It’s oily (but probably why it is such a good moisturizer).If you don’t mind oily, I would recommend"
4,Impressed that the product doesn’t irritate sensitive skin or cause breakouts. Has a light almost baby powder soft smell to it. Absorbs well but leaves a dewy coating on the skin. Have not noticed any change in my skin yet but might use it on some friends and family to leave another review on it’s affects on different conditions.
4,"The smell of it from the bottle reminds me of fire ball but once you rub it on your skin it smells lovely, my skin did break out a little bit, everyone’s skin is different especially when trying new products but I do like this I have been trying it for about 3wks now some of my dark marks are going away, would definitely buy and recommend to a friend"
4,"Makes my tummy and back break out but really does work better than most things. I’d use it next pregnancy from the moment I found out. Acne or no acne, it helps stretch marks fade and keeps my belly moisturized"
4,i gave this to my friend and she broke out in a rash all over her body and she only used it on her face. it worked fine on me. depends on the person i guess. it made me break out on my face if i used it too much though. it does help with scarring. smells like hospital or somethin
4,Easy to use
4,If you put too much it makes your whole face like oily and like the most like basically you’re touching olive oil when you put too much stuff on your face but if you put the right amount on your face and let it soak in your face it is awesome it’s gotten rid of my scars and it’s just the best thing ever
4,"I’ve been using this product for a while now on a very large scar and some stretch marks. It hasn’t made much of a difference for the stretch marks, even though I’ve also lost 10lbs in the time I’ve been using this oil. The stretch marks are being very stubborn.However, it has softened the appearance of my supersized scar. It also keeps the scarred area well hydrated throughout the day, which prevents itchiness. I would say that I prefer having this oil on my scarred area as opposed to not having it.I accidentally got some of this oil on my face one morning and assumed I would breakout - very happy (and impressed!) that was not the case. It felt quite nice actually! So if you’re considering using this product on your face, it’s got my seal of approval.Overall I like this oil and enjoy the way it feels on my skin, particularly the scarred area that’s prone to dryness. Not sure if I will purchase more in the future though, since it doesn’t seem to do anything for my stretch marks. I may test out a few other products and then choose a favorite."
4,Excellent
4,Good one like how make the skin soft
4,"Purchased this with little hope and have been using it daily. After a week, I've seen my stretch marks from being pregnant start to fade away. I've also used it on my skin to make it more evenly and on my scars in hopes of fading but have yet to see results. 4 stars because I still have hope and although it's oily, it isn't messy."
4,Oily....greasy....will make skin supple but does not penetrate layers.....had better success with traditional lotion......May be good for surface damage when combined with dermal abrasion
4,I like it not greasy
4,"I like it. (As long as it’s the genuine bio-oil product). The smell is original and besides being an all around nice smell, I feel that it also works as a mosquito repellent. Of course that could be from a few of the oils found in bio-oil that are very beneficial to us for many reasons, Lavender, Rosemary and Chamomile Oil. I talked my fiancé into trying it and was surprised that he liked the smell and all around results when using bio-oil 1-2 times daily. Will recommend and will buy again !"
4,It looks like the real deal so I would say purchase it
4,"I originally bought this for my scar, after having a hysterectomy.  I found it's also great for my mild psoriasis.  I use it to moisturize my legs, I love how it's easily absorbed and doesn't feel greasy."
4,Great soft smell and excellent for sensitive skin types.
4,GOOD
4,So I LOVE this! It rubs on nice and I feel like I dont have to wait too long to pull my pants up over my stomach after applying. Also to scent isn't overwhelming or strong which is great! Been using it for almost 2 months now and still not sick of the smell! But with that said I don't believe I'll buy another bottle bc it doesn't have a pump. Its super inconvenient to have to squirt it out especially if I'm going back for more...If they updated this product with a pump it would be the best. I may repurchase it if the one I got my last two pregnancy is still out of stock (which is why I bought this one in the first place lol) but not sure bc it really does bug me not having a pump. And yes I knew it didn't have a pump when I bought it but didn't think it would be that annoying not to have it.
4,I wish the fragrance was more subtle. Product works very well.
4,I love bio oil for my stretch marks and dark spots. It needs to be used periodically
4,This is my first time using the product and it smells good and I rub it on my stretch marks everyday
4,Sleek. Absorbs well nice subtle scent. A little goes a long way.
4,Good value for money
4,I love this stuff!
4,Smells weird but other than that i like it i hope it works on my stretch marks
4,"I use it to treat facial blemishes. You can use this regularly on facial areas where blemishes tend to reoccur and new ones will be less noticeable from the start. It's not a miracle worker. I noticed improvement (fading) in 3-5 days, but it's an ongoing process of continuing to use the product to fade the blemishes. It also has improved the health of my facial skin overall."
4,"I have been using this for a couple months now and haven't really noticed much of a difference with my scars.  It has a pleasant scent, absorbs quickly, and isn't greasy, so thats a plus.  I probably won't buy it again, but I don't regret this purchase.  Sometimes you just need to try stuff to see if it works for you.  This, in terms of lightening my old scars not so much, but its fine otherwise.  The instructions recommend 3 months of use so I will continue to use it until it is gone, if my scars change I will amend this review."
4,I really like it. The sent is soft not overpowering.  I recommend this product.
4,"I love the sent. Subtle, fresh, clean. Not sure if it did anything for my stretch marks(they're old and apparently this works best on new scars) but I enjoyed using this as a daily moisturizer. Did not last long though and it was sold out when I went to repurchase 😑. I wish you could get a bigger bottle because it is easy to use thos fast especially if you'll be usinv morning and night."
4,I use this product for my growing belly to avoid stretch marks. It's not oily and doesn't feel sticky like other oil product and I really love the feel and texture of it. The scent is so nice. Would be nice if this product is more clean or organic.
4,"Great product, currently 23 weeks pregnant and no stretch marks so far! I am starting to have itchiness though I wish it help with the itchiness"
4,I have used Bio oil for years but only buy it when its on-sale at my favorite drug store. Ive purchase it from Amazon but the price is much higher compare to drugstores or Walmart.
4,"I like it, its my first time using this. Im on day 6 of using twice daily and my skin seems softer.. I'm not expecting immediate results but as for now i like it.."
4,"takes awhile to clear things up but not all the way, so it works some for fading dark spots had to use yogart to get rid of the mark on my legg."
4,Has no scent which is ok. But I recommend to- Stay away from if you break out.
4,Works great
4,"I LOVE this. My stretch marks are looking wayyy better. But wow, it smells bad."
4,Not sure if it’s doing anything but it smells super good and it feels great.
4,So far so good
4,this is a good price for size.  usually buy @ BJS but the price is crayyy. use it for sons scars on legs and it isnt too oily and shiny. also doesnt have a smell which is great. natural.
4,"Great moisturizer, doesn't leave skin oily and scent is pleasant. I almost finished 1 bottle and did not notice any difference in my scar or my stretch marks. As mentioned on other reviewes, more than 1 bottle may be needed to notice results."
4,"I used it before and I thought it was pretty good, so I bought another bottle for my brother to get acne marks."
4,"I’ve only been using for two months. What I noticed within that time was the radiance and this sort of youthful glow whenever I applied the oil. On days when I skipped or forget the application, I do notice my skin/face looked tired and dehydrated.  So on that note of skin being nourished and being supple, it definitely met those expectations. Now on the scar lightening/removing claims I have yet to really see any of those improvements, though I understand that to achieve those takes a longer time and full commitment. I have seen a couple spots disappear and reappear now and then, or was that my dirty mirror...wait....lol.  With that said, the fragrance is pleasant and although a little thicker in viscosity than other oils, it applies easily—-seriously you only need two dabs on your palm for your whole face. Probably use less if you have oily skin.  I’m pretty sure I’ll buy this again because that skin nourishment really makes you look like you’ve turned back the hands of time."
4,I’ve been pretty happy with this product. I feel like it is helped my post ache scars diminish very much over the past 3 to 4 months of use. I bought another bottle recently :)
4,"Quick turnaround time from order to delivery but when I opened the package the box was damaged. Luckily, the actual product wasn’t leaking or it was definitely getting returned. I love this stuff and definitely in need since I’m further in my third trimester, I am not willing to go through the hassle of returning only to run into the same issue again. Figured might as well keep it. Please do better with the packaging though. Highly disappointing."
4,It did not do what I wanted but still great for skin
4,Works well for dry skin took away marks on my face
4,"I bought for an upcoming surgery based on YouTube vloggers that showed their scars after surgery. I used some on my hand to get an idea of what it’s like.  It’s lightly scented, and doesn’t leave your skin greasy. It was easy to rub in and didn’t leave a stain or otherwise effect my clothing.  It’s thick but soft and satiny. Oh, I literally had to put the back of my hand to my nose to smell it, so if you are concerned with scent, don’t be!"
4,No improvement on my stretch marks yet since it says to use it for months but it really helps with my dry skin and I really love the scent!! Will update when there’s improvements on my scars and stretchmarks 😉
4,"This stuff is great! I have a lot of dark spots on my chin from pimples, and this has helped to clear it up. I don't use it when my face is extra oily, because it will add extra oil and contribute to breakouts. But it has really made a difference in my skin!"
4,"It’s a product that gonna last for a long time ,  just need to use a bit to make your skin feel gonna “ moisturized “ . I like it"
4,"Great for stress mark, the price went up more than I expected!"
4,I loved it!!
4,"I purchased because of the reviews. I haven't seen results just yet, but I like the smell and makes my skin soft. I would buy again."
4,I've been using this product for at least 2 weeks now and I'm already seeing results. My skin is glowing and acne free
4,"My body seems to soak this product up which is a good thing because the oil does get all over my clothes. I’m not a huge fan of the scent, it’s not terrible it’s just not my favorite. I started using this towards the end of my pregnancy and I definitely felt like my skin felt moisturized. It didn’t prevent stretch marks all together but who knows how many more I could have had without using this I still use it to see if it will fade them at all.  Not seeing much of different 2.5 months post partly but I enjoy the moisture so I will continue to use."
4,"Smells good, light to the skin."
4,It’s okay
4,I like this oil. It smells really nice not over bearing. It keeps my pregnant belly from itching and being dry.
4,I love how well it mosturized my skin and the scent wasn't too strong. It doesn't leave an oil stain on any of my clothes. Definitely buying again!
4,"This product is nice. For me the only thing I don’t like is how grease it leaves your skin. I use very little, let it absorb and wipe with a warm cloth. I stay busy so this lengthy process doesn’t fit for a consistent routine for me."
4,The product smells great. Currently using the product to see if it’s effective.
4,"This bio oil is very nice for the skin, feels very smooth and blends in well nicely. Most oils sit on the skin and transfer everywhere, this oil absorbs but feels moisturized for hours. Nice smooth skin and if it can help with stretch marks and scars over time I will keep buying, I’ve only been using for one month so I haven’t seen improvement in scars or stretch marks yet but I am hopeful!"
4,"Great for moisturizing skin, doesn’t really help with stretch marks but makes skin healthy shiny and soft!"
4,"The only reason it's getting four stars is because it does leave my face feeling greasy afterwards, everything else it says it does is true for me."
4,"Good product. Price too high for the amount, but I guess you get what you pay for."
4,So far this (if nothing else) helps to keep the scar moisturized allowing for proper healing and stretching as my son's skin expands. He has sensitive skin and his skin takes to this just fine.He's 14 months and had a fall causing a big scar on his nose. Doc said it'll take up to a year to fully heal and natural oils are great for scars. So we'll see a year from now how it looks.Note: I let the scab heal first before using this product.I use it daily to aid the healing process. His pink scar seems to be fading faster than I expected. So far so good.
4,"First time using bio oil. Bought the biggest bottle, as I’m planning to use it throughout my pregnancy.Seal or no seal: there is NO seal. There are so many conflicting info in the reviews and the Q&As. So I actually went to the local drug store and got one to compare. Same thing, no seal. The one I got from the store is the smallest size.Maybe years ago it came with a seal? I don’t know. All I know is that the current version doesn’t. So please stop calling it a fake because of that.Pros:I developed dry/red/flaky skin around my mouth since pregnancy. I tried lotions, serums and oil based essence but none of them last more than a couple of hours before the skin becomes dry and flaky again. I tried this bio oil around my mouth, it actually would keep the area moisturized very long. I do wash my mouth after meals and re-apply, so I don’t know whether it’d last a whole day, but it has been dramatically longer lasting than my other products. The redness is also reducing overtime. Not completely gone yet, but previous the redness was surrounding my mouth area, now it’s only at the corner of the mouth and above, nothing on the chin any more.My husband is also using it on his knuckles on one hand that’s itchy. It seems to be helpful for his skin condition too. We don’t know exactly what that is, the doctor just asked him to put anti-itchy cream which isn’t very helpful. This oil does help so he’s been using it.Cons:Gosh for me, it has to be the smell. I honestly thought it was a fake product when I first tried it because I really don’t like the smell! Some reviewers said they love the smell or it comes with a pleasant smell, no it doesn’t! That’s another reason for me to get one from the drug store to compare. It turns out that’s just how this thing smells. It has a a pretty strong oil smell that reminds me of industrial oil products. It doesn’t come with the any flowery or pleasant smell, not even like the basic no-smell oils, but actually something I dislike. So be forewarned. If you put a little on your palm, the smell isn’t strong, but if you rub it in, like on your tummy or on your face, holding your breath for a few seconds won’t do it. Since I do use it around my mouth, I even tried to mix it with my other non oil based serums to cover its smell a little, which helps but it also reduces its moisturizing effect. Since it’s the only product that works with the dry skin around my mouth, I’m biting the bullet. The smell doesn’t linger for long, so that was helpful.If you are not sure about the smell, get a small bottle to try it out. At least for me, the benefits out win the smell issue for me.Funny that I’m not mentioning any stretch mark effect as pros or cons. I actually have developed some stretch marks on my lower back and my butt cheeks before using this product since the pregnancy, not on tummy yet. I don’t expect the product to get rid of the existing stretch marks or at least not in a short period of time. Maybe in a few months it’d get better over, and more important to me is for prevention of new stretch marks."
4,This product is really nice for moisturizer and nice scent
4,"Great oil mixture for scars or eczema it seems as winter approaches. Excited to see if this helps with my scars but so far extremely moisturing and the smell is very light ""old lady"" floral perfume scented but it's not very noticable and almost all oils will have a scent. The scent doesn't bother me enough to not give this a shot like others complain about in the comments."
4,"I think the product is working, but I’m not sure that it truly works better than coconut-based creames."
4,"I bought the product for my eczema skin issues. However, It did not good but worse my rashes. It's sad since I really like how well it moisturizer and soften other skin areas."
4,"I have only been using this product for about two weeks now and I can already see a difference in my skin. I have sensitive mostly dry skin and this has worked wonders. So far no irritation and my complexion is evening out. I have been using it mainly on areas of my face where there are dark marks. I use it after washing and toning, and before moisturizer and SPF. I would recommend for anyone looking to correct discoloration and/or dark spots."
4,"The oil is really nice. The smell isn’t too strong, too. It has helped my skin stay hydrated, but I haven’t seen a huge difference with the pregnancy stretch marks. I had in my head that the oil would lighten the marks in about 2 weeks, but I’ve been using it for almost two months every single day, and the marks are still very visible in some sections of my body. I do love using the oil and enjoy the consistency after using it. My body doesn’t feel oily, my skin soaks it in. Overall nice product."
4,"From my 9months pregnant wife: I use this mostly at night, because it can stain clothes (that’s why it’s getting 4 stars instead of 5). I haven’t used it long enough to see if the stretch marks “go away”, but I like how it smells, how fast it gets absorbed in the skin and how it soothes the itchiness of the growing belly."
4,Have used this multiple times and I keep on buying this for her. Awesome moisturizer and good smell as well. Really softens and nourishes the skin. But this is on a costlier side. And is very often used.
4,"I bought this to use for my C section scar and stretch marks, about 2 months after baby was born. I have been using it morning and night for past month.Things I like:-Nice light scent-Absorbs relatively quickly-Highly mosturizing-Has significantly improved eczema on arms that developed post part (nice surprise!)Thins I do not like:-Have to use a significant amount (I have lots of stretch marks), already halfway done with bottle-Because of consistency, my vanity where I store it has an oily residue on it (cleans up easily though)It has only been 1 month so not sure how it will improve stretch marks and scars. I do not see a difference yet but skin is feeling healthier overall and will keep doing this for at least 3 months and provide an update."
4,I have very sensitive skin and it did not bug me. It has a nice consistency and does NOT leave a gross sticky or greasy residue like most oils do. The only downfall it smells like straight up old lady perfume. I added some lavender essential oil and it helped.
4,"I really enjoyed this product. The scent isn’t awful but it definitely isn’t pleasant. I have very sensitive skin and I’ve had no issues at all. I use this oil after my shower nightly, and wash off what ever is left over the next morning. It is an oil so I do not use it durning the day for the sole purpose that it makes my face super shiny. I can’t say if the product lives up to its intended use, but regardless I love this stuff. I also have only used it on my face so I can’t comment for use in other areas. I wouldn’t say it’s moisturizing but it’s for sure hydrating. I can’t wait to see what it does for my skin in the winter. And I will say my natural skin seems to be so radiant and glowing after using this consistently."
4,"It's my first time to use it. My friends recommend it most. After using it, I think it is too oily and will stain my clothes"
4,My grand daughter uses it too shes 16 she notices stains on face disappears out and pimples too
4,I like it a lot! I noticed a difference. But everyone’s situation is different
4,"This is a simple item, but effective. I notice the scars resulting from removing keloids already growing smaller and fainter. That's all I need."
4,"So, I was nervous about using this because my legs tend to get clogged pores easily or just get irritated easily. I use this after showers and give it a bit to absorb. I do feel like my scars have soften in appearance, but this product does take time to fix skin concerns and I think you need to use it for at least 3 months to see any intended results. The smell is good and it does absorb okay (might be a little oily, but when I wake up I just have hydrated legs). I feel like it has been good for my tummy which sometimes feels like it just isn't smooth. Like how cellulite can look, but not quite the same. I do work out, but it just never looks smooth, but that is changing and this is something I have added to my routine so I feel like this is doing something. I do use Fur oil for post-shaving and this layers good with that. I did order a larger size and do feel like it works well for me."
4,"I am loving this for stretch marks. I’m 20 weeks pregnant and apply every morning. I will update later in my pregnancy, but right now I’m feeling very moisturized."
4,"After having my first baby, I noticed my skin became sensitive and very dry. The normal lotion didn't fit my need, so I added 2 drops into the lotion to moisture my whole body skin every day. After using it for 3 days, my skin became better! That's impressive. I'd highly recommend not to use too many drops once, or it would cause acne. However, I didn't like the design of the bottle itself. Why not design it as a push-on bottle? It's very inconvenient. I waste a lot of the oil just because it slips from my oily hand... That's super annoying."
4,Introduced to this oil by a friend. LOVE IT! A light scent. It was delivered in a timely manner (pre corona). It is as product description says.
4,I like bio-oil. It keeps my skin and my face glowed.
4,I have been using this on certain areas of my tattoo after getting it and it has healed nicely.
4,Bought this product for my sister! I used it a couple years back for stretchMarks and it worked super well! I got a little rash at first but my skin is super sensitive! Would definitely recommend if you are trying to get rid of or lessen the appearance of stretchmarks! Works well and the scent is really good! It does not leave your skin dry!
4,"The oil has a great smell, a bit on the greasy side. I do notice a bit of irritation when I use it on my face. I haven’t noticed a difference on fading of any marks or scars but it hasn’t been a month yet."
4,Well I wont lie it takes time to see PROGRESS you have to use it daily even 2 times I buy it for my stretch Mark's and am now on my second bottle it makes your skin feel so soft and it works
4,good
4,It looks like someone jumped on mine and it was definitely open before because the pack was tiring apart but overall the product is good
4,Haven’t seen a difference so far but I’ve only been using it a couple weeks. Smells good and is moisturizing though.
4,This oil is amazing! After using 2 nights I noticed less itching of my stretch marks!I am 9 months pregnant & my body loves this stuff! But the smell is a bit MUCH!
4,"I have been using this stuff every other day (alternating with coconut oil) to moisturize my skin as my belly grows. I loved the scent and the way it moisturized so much that I now use it on my entire body. I haven't gotten a lot of stretch marks, but I did eventually develop some on my hips / top of butt and under my breasts although I was using this product. I think developing some stretch marks is normal, especially with my genetics, as I am prone to getting them! I have continued to buy this product over & over throughout my pregnancy because I think it does a great job keeping my skin as elastic as possible. I would not recommend using this every day or more than once a day because I did notice that if I did this, I started to develop acne on my chest and stomach and random places on my body. I think the oil started to clog my pores. Overall, if you switch off using this with another lotion and skin product, I think it is a great addition to help with pregnancy stretch marks! Also, let's be honest, this is not the cheapest product out there, so switching off with something else will make it last a lot longer. I hope this helps!"
4,Pretty straightforward
4,Smells great. Waiting to see if it works.
4,"Okay so everyone was raving about this product and I had to give it a try. I have some really intense stretch marks and scars from health issues I’ve had. I’ve always wished they weren’t there so I thought I would give this a shot. After using this religiously for 3 months, I definitely saw an improvement. I have really pale skin and my scars are purple and red so they are very noticeable. After consistent use, they began to fade.What I will say is that it took a while to see a difference and for how much money this costs and the results I was seeing, I don’t think I’ll keep using it. It seems like it’s going to be too expensive and take to long to invest that much into. But I’m glad I tried it.It has a lot of other uses too. I’ve used it in my hair and stuff as well."
4,I enjoy it. It's a bit messy but it smells nice and hydrated my skin. I haven't noticed much difference to my stretch marks and I've been using this along with a few other products. Might just be me.
4,"Smells great, I just got it so I can’t say if it works or not. It makes me skin feel very soft and smells like a fancy baby oil with hints of flowers."
4,Smells good and feels great to rub in your skin
4,Loved it
4,Really like this product!
4,"Wanted to love this but I don’t like how this oil doesn’t dry down for a long time. I know with an oil that is to be expected but if you are using this for pregnancy stretch marks that means not putting on clothes for a while unless you are okay with it getting on everything. That being said, I do still use this from time to time because I really like the smell and how it feels to apply."
4,"Smells very pleasant, I don't feel as sick as compared to the artificial scented body oil."
4,"I would say this is more of a body oil than it is a face oil. It smells like baby oil to me, very pleasant smell. My face didn’t like it, but my body loves it! I used it wherever I have stretch marks. Love the bottle, love the scent, love this for all over the body, just not face."
4,Decent body oil but I cannot say that it does miracles.I like my skin after it but to be honest I love Bodyshop Moringa lotion best of them all.
4,"I took a chance on these and couldn't believe how great they worked. I would not recommend if you have very sensitive skin. I am not sure what magic is in these little dots, but whatever you put them on, the next day it's gone -- vanished. I'm a fan!"
4,They do the job. They are a little but too sticky for my taste but it stays long enough to protect your pimples
4,"This is a product that works great. Treats, hides & will continue ordering …. It’s not just for teens it’s for anyone who has those occasional spots. WORKS GREAT"
4,So far its okay but it was kinda hard to take off. I didn't figure it out till 5 mins later tbh. But overall pretty good product!
4,I have had on and off success with these; still not sure on their effectiveness.
4,i dint review often but I really like this acne patch. I tried other brand such as Cosrx and it have little effect ok my skin. This product pulled most whiteheads gunk overnight.
4,I really like patches that have stuff like tea tree oil in them and not just the hydrocolloid itself for when I get acne with a lot of pus. You do t get much compared to other brands but you do have to take into account that some are fully hydrocolloid and some have hydrocolloid with ingredients in them to Gelo clear the acne more while it’s taking out the gunk. These are a little pricey for me but I wouldn’t mind repurchasing again. Only thing was they were a teeny bit too thin & I hate when they’re too thick as well but I feel like they maybe adhere better when they’re thin so I mean not a big deal if it helps stick to my face.
4,"This product works, but not on cystic acne that has been there for awhile.  You need to apply it as soon as you feel the pimple under your skin. This was used in conjunction with acne pads and Zapzyt in the evening/overnight and these pads in the day.  They are very good at hiding the spot, where you can't see it"
4,It sucks up the gunk yay but SOMETIMES when you peel it off it leaves a big hole in your skin. This happens mostly with big pimples.
4,"i’m shocked at how well these work. i put them on before bed and by the time i wake up, the bump is muuuuch smaller. i have super sensitive skin and this hasn't irritated it at all"
4,"This product is very good, it gets the job done and works over night! It has a lot of bigger sizes but not as much smaller ones. Very good for the price of the product 👍 would buy again"
4,Don't work as well as I hoped but gets some gunk out of your pores.
4,Really good and it helped a lot with my pimples
5,"I have been using this for about a week, and my cracked nails are already healing and growing. I usually do not like scented products, but the coconut scent is very nice and not too overpowering."
5,My nails ands hands looks well moisturized
5,Love the smell of coconut. Only product that I have ever used that help strengthen my nails and prevent peeling. I use it at least twice a day. I highly recommend it
5,Smells great
5,"My nails were so bad from using gel polish. I was so impressed after only using for a few days, I could really tell a difference. my nails are nice and smooth now and they even look healthy. I will definitely buy again."
5,"Honestly this is pretty good stuff.  I am a male that doesn't pay much attention to my nails, however, I used to bite my nails because of anxiety and once I went an a medication for anti anxiety, I started to grow my nails.  They would break however,  that has changed with this product. I am impressed and the price is very affordable."
5,"This cream has a pleasant, light scent.  It doses exactly as it claims.  Neater cuticles and harder nails.  I don’t know how they do that, just so glad they do!"
5,"Smells great, works great!"
5,A little bit goes a long way with this stuff! Smells great and I didn’t have an issue with my sensitive skin
5,"No more dry and cracked nails. I no longer need to use nail polish. My nails are so healthy now, that it looks like a French manicure done."
5,I've been using Hard as Hoof Strengthner for a year or 2 and it really strengthens my nails and moisturizes my nails and hands
5,"I have the weakest nails. They break, they split, they have huge ridges, it's awful. I was cautiously optimistic about this product, but I really did see results. My nails were stronger. I don't know if they grew faster or anything, but they grew without breaking, which is the same or better."
5,Love the smell and how easy it is to apply. I plan on buying this again. It really has helped my nails a lot.
5,This nail has a nice feel and smell. It's not greasy and a little goes a long way. I am very satisfied with this purchase.
5,"This stuff really works. My natural nails are longer than they ever have been in just fifteen days. They used to chip and flake like bad, but so far so good"
5,I really feel like in just two weeks this product has stopped my nails from splitting and they look much healthier!  Would definitely purchase again!
5,"I have just bought my second jar (and, before I forget, the jar is very deceptive, with a raised bottom, thick walls, and a deep lid), and suspect I will keep on buying it. My nails used to be thin as paper, and it was not uncommon to have nine broken ones. Then I got onto Nature's Bounty hair skin and nails, which helped.But my left hand index finger bail broke a lot, and left hand thumbnail tended to shred along the inside, and right hand thumbnail had a perpetual chip in it along the outside.So I thought I'd try this.Results: Right hand thumbnail still has the chip, but, after filing it away, it seems to come back more slowly. I guess the left hand thumbnail is still weaker, but it hasn't broken. Neither has index fingernail. It's come close, but filing has been enough.For context, I've been moving furniture, painting, and digging holes for new plants. So I'm pleased."
5,Ladies/gentlemen this nail miracle is a true product. One week and my nails look like I’m wearing acrylic. I will purchase again!!!!
5,I love it
5,"I love the smell and used the product at night to moisture my cuticles. After a month or so, my nails aren’t breaking like they used to. Kinda can’t believe how much stronger they are."
5,"This product helped me go from weak, brittle, peeling nails to strong and long fingernails in about 10 days. I don't always remember to use it regularly, and it still gives me great results. Highly recommend."
5,I really like it.
5,Easy to use and actually works!
5,"I usually never review products, but with this one, I had to!It really works. I used to have to use nail polish to keep my nails thick and not breaking, but everytime I removed the polish they were even more damaged!I've had this product for about 3 months and my nails have never been so thick and long! It took about a month to notice, but now it is undeniable. I don't need polish anymore, unless I just want color, but my nails are strong and beautiful!"
5,"I have very thin, flexible nails that break easily.  I've been using OTC products from the drug store for years and have had mediocre results.  Hard As Hoof has made my nails much stronger, grow faster and my cuticles soft and smooth in just one month.  Just massage a bit into your nails and cuticles every day and it works like a charm.  Highly recommend."
5,It is really good for me
5,"Bought a few products to help resolve my brittle nails. One other product, that is like a nail polish but claims to resolve brittle nails,  made my nails much worse.  Hard as Hoof has proven it's worth and has made a positive difference.  I tossed the other stuff in the trash."
5,Thickened my nails so much. Just after a few months. This saved my nails. They will finally grow now without breaking.
5,I love this product.  Makes nails strong and healthy.  I also love how great it smells!  Will buy again!
5,This product has strengthened and improved the look of my nails as I have grown them out. The texture and scent of the cream is also very nice.  The cream  lubricates the nail and cuticle without leaving a greasy unpleasant residue on surrounding skin.
5,I have finally found a great product for moisturizing my cuticles to keep them from splitting. Definitely will purchase again
5,"I like this product. Took off my dips and when I put them on again by someone who didn’t do a good job - like I was able to peel off the dips within a week, I used Hard as Hoof again and it continued to strengthen my nails and I was able to grow them. Love this product."
5,I use this every Niigata and every morning. Have noticed a difference with my nails getting stronger.
5,"I recently had a medical procedure that weakened my nails, so I was referred to this old favorite product as a way to get my nails back in tip-top shape. I had used this stuff in the early 90s - this batch is much fresher and seems to work even better than I remember. Has a nice coconutty scent and sinks into the nail beds quickly. Nice to use at night."
5,My cuticles are in much better condition!
5,Hard as hoof is a great product with a pleasant sent.  It really works as described. I have been using for about 2 months once a day . My nails are stronger and are growing. My husband had a slit in his nail for years and used many products with no results. After only a few days he saw slit was disappearing and after few months almost healed. Highly recommended you won’t be disappointed
5,Very good product!
5,I bought this because of the favorable reviews.  This stuff is awesome.  I NEVER had long nails because they constantly split and my cuticles were horrible.  My nails are gorgeous now.  This stuff smells amazing.
5,"This product works great but you have to used it, almost need a smaller container to keep on youI like to garden and my hands are wet a lot of the time. Using this product does help strengthen the nails, but you have to use it."
5,Don't know yet if it works but it feels & smells nice
5,"I had worn acrylic or gel nails for 20+ years but because of covid, getting my nails done came to a halt. I knew my nails would be in terrible condition, I just did not know how terrible. For a year I tried different strengthening creams, strengtheners you paint on, I’ve increased my vitamins and nothing helped my nails until I found this. I had one nail that had completely‘s split up the middle and my nails were paper thin. I use the cream throughout the day, just whenever I think about it. The new growth looks great and healthy, my nails are no longer peeling or splitting, and are beginning to look good again!"
5,Easy to use and if you use to much it is a very good skin cream
5,My nails are much stronger after one month of use!
5,"I’ve used gel nail polish for a while and my nails became very thin, this helped my nails grow back stronger."
5,Used it only a couple of days I like the smell of it use barely any it should last a long time so far it seems to strengthen the nail
5,"I'm ashamed to admit I have bitten my nails all my life; a disgusting habit. I wanted to quit especially because of COVID concerns. Hard as Hoof quickly transformed my soft, dry, peeling nails into shining, strong, and rock hard nails within a couple of weeks. I kept the product close to where I spend much of my days and evenings so it was convenient for me to easily & quickly massage it onto my nails several times a day. The transformation was truly rapid. My nails have NEVER looked this good! They are healthy, strong, and shining!  I'm so thankful for this outstanding product!  I don't understand why everyone who's purchased it doesn't rave about it. There are many causes of nail problems, and it's reasonable to assume that problems are caused by a diversity of nail deficiencies. I can PROMISE you that if you follow the directions and apply this product 3x day, you will be pleased by the results.  I'm certainly recommending it to all my friends, most whose nails don't look nearly as good as mine do now!!"
5,Easy to grow it does not take much product
5,I was looking for something to help my nails to be healthy and strong.  I have been using this 8/9.  I have notice that my nails are becoming hard after the first day.
5,This smells sooo good! My hands are soft from using it but the best part is I've only been using it for 5 days and my nails are already growing and improving! Definitely recommend.
5,This was recommended by a friend  to me. The smell is wonderful but not over powering. It goes on amazingly without any greasy residue
5,"This product works just as described. Started to notice a change within a few days, which is something new for me since my nails were like onion skins. Looking forward to obtaining the natural strong nails I've always wanted."
5,"This product does exactly what it claims, which rarely ever happens nowadays. It truly is a great, reliable product. However, every time I open it, my dogs scurry over to get a lick. So weird. If you have labradors, beware! They may try to eat it lol."
5,This really improve the look of my nails. They are stronger the cuticles are neater and the grooves on my nails are getting less noticeable. Also like the smell and the way it was absorbed. Would recommend.
5,"I have only been using this for a couple of weeks and I can see a difference in my nails and the skin around them! I haven't had a hangnail since I started using this stuff! It has a light scent that's like coconut, it's not overpowering-very pleasant. I have tried so many products out there to increase my nail health and this by far is my favorite. Definitely will be a repeat purchase!"
5,I like that you can use it with or without nail polish. The smell is a coconut vanilla and immediately makes your cuticles feel soft. In the summer here in AZ my cuticles get dry and I end up with hangnails. This prevents that from happening. It’s so great I use it on my hands and feet as well. Don’t hesitate to give it a try!
5,"When I started using this, I thought it wouldn't work.  It feeks like a rich hand cream, and it smells so good, but wasn't sure if it would affect my nails.  IT DOES!!! I use it often throughout the day.  Within two months, my nails felt stronger!"
5,I had a nail splitting from end of nail toward beginning of nail and rubbing this cream into nail has stopped the split and healed it. Still have to use it to keep nail healthy and healing complete.
5,I love this product. My nails are finally strong enough to grow long without having to have polish on.
5,Oh my goodness!! This is the holy grail of hand creams and amazing for your cuticles as well. I have used soooo many hand creams and this is by far the best. Several women recommended it on a Nail Facebook group. So glad I took their advice!
5,I really like this stuff as a hand cream too & it smells good.
5,Love the scent and feel. Not oily but dies it’s job. Nails are stronger.
5,"I don’t know what’s in this stuff, but my nails are stronger, and they’re growing—FAST. I’m not sure if it’s the massaging of the cuticles when I apply the product, or the actual application of the product itself…or both. Either way, I’m seeing amazing results. Yep, it’s worth a try!"
5,"I have very brittle nails. I have to keep nail polish on if I don't want them to break. It's frustrating. I've found if I use this cream every day then my nails really do get stronger, but if I don't keep it up, they become brittle again over time. So keep using! The cream is also a great moisturizer for you hands, but it does smell like coconut. So if you hate that smell, don't buy this. I like it. It's a little oily until your fingers/hands absorb, so know that you have to wait a little before using your computer or there will be a residue to wipe off. Overall, I'm glad I found this product. I just have to remember to use it each day. Haha."
5,"It definitely worked on my nails! I can rarely grow my nails since they are very brittle and starts cracking from sides as soon as it’s growing. After 2 weeks of using this product my nails grew and it did not break at all, I ended up clipping them once it passed 1” from the tip of my finger."
5,I’m not one to write reviews but this product is so great I feel like I should. My cuticles were terrible so my manicure never looked good. I’ve used this for 2 days and already see a drastic difference. I also put it on my heels and can’t believe the improvement in just 2 days!
5,I really like how it smells.
5,I have only used product for a short time but my nails are looking  better.
5,"The holy grail of nail care. This stuff is everything, it smells good without being overly offensive, it lasts forever (a little goes a long way), it has such a gorgeous texture and it literally saved my nails. It makes your nails grow like crazy too!"
5,"I literally just put this product on so I can’t really give a full/accurate description yet, however I can say that it’s definitely moisturizing. I can tell a noticeable difference on my cuticles after application. Can’t speak for the hardness just yet but I’m hopeful! Also, this products smells undeniably similar to Palmer’s Coconut Oil Deep Conditioning Pack ANDDD it has the same consistency too 🤔UPDATE!! 🤩Actually works to harden nails but takes a few days of application. I’m impressed!"
5,This product pretty much did what it said it would do. My nails were really damaged. I used the product as instructed and it really improved the look of my nails. Plus it smells great. Will purchase again when I run out.
5,"This product was awesome, although it didn’t speed up my nail growth, it made them super durable and I’ve always bitten my nails, and this has helped me stop! Too strong to chew through!"
5,Helps stop nails from splitting.
5,"Smells nice, it does feel a little greasy. My nails have been stronger and cuticles look better."
5,"This is a great moisturizer for my nails and cuticles. Not too greasy, easy to apply, and soaks into my skin really well. I really like it a lot and I have added it to my moisturizing routine."
5,Got it to help my nails grow
5,"I have used so many nail strengtheners and this one truly works.  My nails are stronger and my cuticles look great!  I love nail polish, but it does a number on my nails, and this product helps them recover so much more quickly than anything else I’ve tried.  I do not like the coconut scent, but I’ll put up with it for the fantastic results."
5,"This stuff is the truth!!!! My nails would break as soon as I would get the stighest bit of lenght, that has not happened with this product. I’m so glad I finally found something that works and at a good price. A little goes a long way too."
5,Great cream to heal splitting nails and spur healthy growth!
5,"I have super weak nails that chip and break like crazy… I’ve used this daily for only a week and notice a huge difference in the strength of my nails. They look healthy, and don’t break or bend on me! I’ll definitely use this product in between my acrylic sets"
5,I've never been able to grow my nails without it chipping and breaking. I've been using this for about a month now and yes it's growing beautifully! No more press-on nails for me!
5,Nails and cuticles are loving this!
5,this product works well and is not bad smell to it
5,"I have soft nails. For years, I have tried a multitude of products at various price points that require various amounts of effort with various results. None have come close as Hard as Hoof. It’s easy to use and effective. My nails have never been as strong - NEVER. I am delighted.I haven’t checked the chemicals as I usually due. I sure hope it’s safe because it will be difficult to give it up. It’s awesome!"
5,"I really like this product! I keep tubs everywhere - in at least two bags/purses, at my bedside, in the kitchen - all over. I started using it because I use Color Street nail strips. It's the only way I can manage to do my nails, but I feel like the strips damage my nail a little. (Not all Color Street users experience this.) I use the Hard as Hoof to moisturize my cuticles. I usually apply once or twice a day, more often in the winter and more often when I've removed the strips and want to work on healing my nails. I love the coconut oil base, it's easy to apply, and it's a product I trust."
5,My nails feel better already. Highly recommend
5,Love the change in my cuticles on my hands and even my toes. They are less dry and I tend to pick or need to trim ragged skin less.  This is my second jar. First jar lasted a long time.
5,I love this stuff!! I’m a vet tech so I’m constantly washing my hands and my fingernails have been brittle for years. Literally 2 weeks after using this and my nails are as long as they’ve ever been with no breakage!! I would definitely recommend to a friend!
5,Strong coconut smell and very moist
5,I've had a nail that grows out with a split for several years.  After using this for a couple of weeks it started growing out without the split.  My nails look super healthy also.  Great stuff!!!!!
5,2x a day and it really improves your nails.  Highly recommend
5,Not sure about strengthening my nails as a gel manicure destroyed my nails but it sure does help with softening my cuticles and area surrounding my fingers
5,"I liked this product because when using it as directed, it worked for me. My nails were brittle and cracked from years of wearing artificial nails all the time. I decided to let my natural nails heal. This cream smelled good and helped my nails get better. I would recommend for sure."
5,Worked very well on my very weak and easily torn fingernails in a short time. Nice scent.
5,"My friend recommended this as my nails are a hot mess! I was skeptical, especially paying this much for something I've never tried.  I used it for about a week, and I never want to be without it again!  LOVE this stuff.  My nails are in better shape than they have been in my entire life. By the way, it also smells wonderful . . . sort of vanilla and coconut scented."
5,For my spliting nails used today very soothing and made my nails feel nourished
5,1000% must buy! It saved my nails
5,Very nice product. Waiting to see results but seems to be working nicely after 2 weeks.
5,Been using it once a day for a few months now over my nail polish and haven’t broken a nail since I started using it when normally I would break at least one a week (stupid job). Super happy with this.
5,"I try to apply at least two times a day, but with constant washing of hands, I was hesitant that this product would even have a chance.  I can definitely see the difference.  Not only are my cuticles stronger, but the nail bed is stronger and definitely less nail breakage."
5,I love this product. I can see a real difference in my nails! I can finally see white at my nail tips! I will keep using thisand write another review later!
5,Great nail and cuticle moisturizer that is not greasy!  Nails are much stronger!
5,Affordable treatment that works and is easy to use.
5,Love this product. I’ve been using it for several months with great results. My nails feel so much better and are getting stronger. My natural nails are finally past my tips some. The smell is nice of a light coconut.  I’ll purchase again.
5,"This product works!  My nails are soft and split easily, this product makes my nails hard!  It smells great too!"
5,This feels amazing on the nails.  You can actually feel it absorbing and moisturizing.  The coconut scent is really nice.
5,Nails are stronger and healthier after consistent use.
5,Very moisturizing and makes nails feel significantly stronger.
5,This is exactly what I need to strengthen my nails.  It smells great. It's moisturizing and has helped my nails strengthen.
5,"This product is amazing! I ordered it by accident and gave it a try - it smells incredible, is all natural, and the packaging is all recyclable. It’s all just natural ingredients and vitamins - I’m using it on dry skin because it’s like a lotion. Would recommend"
5,Hard as Hooves is a great product. It’s moisturizing properties make my nails grow quickly.  And it smells wonderful-like a coconut flavor.
5,Cream to strengthen nails-someone recommended this product to me
5,I am so glad my daughter recommended this to me.
5,"Absolutely love this! My nails look 100% better after just a couple days of using this.  A little goes a long way, and a jar lasts a long time."
5,I haven't had a broken or split nail since I started using it.
5,"Softens cuticles, I haven’t noticed any difference in the strength of my fingernails"
5,"My nails were brittle and peeling, I started using this on clean nails several times a week. After about two weeks I noticed less peeling and they seemed stronger. I now use it before I polish and around my cuticles. My nails are growing again."
5,"This stuff is amazing!!!! Apart from when I was pregnant, I’ve never had nails strong enough to grow long, And Stay Long. We just went to the beach and after several days of digging and playing on the seashore- not one broken nail. This stuff is 100% true to its truly amazing name."
5,"Easy to use and it really works.  Despite taking biotin daily and other vitamins, my nails were thin and brittle for the first time in my life.  Since starting to use Hard as Hoof my nails are getting stronger and healthier."
5,I love this cream! It made my nails strong to where I could open cat food lids without the nails breaking. It also smells good
5,Love the product!
5,"This is a great product! I don't even use it 3 times a day as directed and it has greatly helped my nails! They don't tear or break as often and I'm able to use nail polish and have pretty nails. If you have problem nails, GET THIS!"
5,"Love this product. 2nd time ordering.  It works.  Also, has nice fragrance & is easy to use."
5,Smells delicious and has made my cuticles and nails so much healthier
5,Best product even over nail polish! Repaired my splitting nails!  Love this!!
5,This stuff works!! My nails can be very brittle and split easily.  I use Hard as Hoof multiple times a day. Now my nails are hard with no splitting.  I definitely recommend.
5,"I am stunned. I have always had soft, peeling nails, and with some nail hardening products they might get brittle as well. I used this and within a couple of days my nails were healthier and stronger and I can finally grow them! I use on nails with and without polish. Where has this product been all my life???"
5,good product and price
5,"Splitting nails are almost gone, after 7 months of use 2 times a day. My nails look better than they have for a long time. Have to use it a long time faithfully."
5,"I'm on my third jar of this this miracle. It's cured my splitting and ridges. I imagine I'll continue for life. Be diligent; it took a couple months for the best result, but improvement starts right away."
5,I cannot believe this cream works great.
5,I have naturally dry cuticles & this helps so much while also aiding in the growth of my nails!!
5,"I absolutely love this product; after taking fake nails off my nails are a terrible mess for many months. But I started using this product right away and my nails grew quickly and stronger. Cant say enough how well it works. I read a review where someone says take it with you at work, or in the kitchen, and apply it (takes less then 2 min) several times a day when u can- and it worked for me. And no more wrecked cuticles either. Great moisturizer for nails and cuticles!!!!"
5,"I am in my late 50s and have been manicuring my nails since high school. Since menopause my nails have been a mess: ridges, breaking, peeling, and yellowed. I tried:1) using non-acetone polish remover2) using acetone remover but only for a few seconds per nail3) using formaldehyde-based nail hardeners - they work for a month or so and then your nails begin to shatter4) using anti-peeling polishes5) using moisturizing polishes6) using Sally Hansen, OPI, Orly, and a ton of other polishes to repair various issues7) biotin supplements8) gel nails (ruined my nails even worse)9) cuticle oilsMy nails were disgusting. I was *desperate* and on the point of making a doctor's appointment to get some type of prescription. Having read about this stuff for years, I decided to give it a try. I had already stopped wearing nail polish (after 40+ years of never being without it) and constantly moisturizing with hand lotion and cuticle oils, which wasn't really helping beyond cosmetically.I applied Hard as Hoof diligently 3 or more times per day. I also kept my nails very short (like no-white showing short). They would grow out a tiny bit, but still appeared peely and ridged. I just kept cutting them off and applying Hard as Hoof.After six weeks I was cynically muttering, ""This doesn't work."" My nails would look better when it was freshly applied, but I wasn't seeing any major difference in strength, peeling or whitening. I vowed I would give it 3 full months, though. I also began applying one coat of clear polish (nothing special, just clear polish) because having polish-free nails just bugged me. I continued applying Hard as Hoof over the polish.Suddenly around 10 weeks in I started to see improvement. Was it just the polish making them LOOK better? No...I removed the polish and they looked whiter, felt stronger, almost no peeling.Now at 11 weeks I looked down this morning and my nails look better than they have looked in 40 years! They are strong. A 1/4 inch of white is showing past the nail bed. And it's WHITE, not yellowed as my nails have been for years. (I""m sure part of this is not wearing polish, but even when I didn't wear colored polish for months, my nail tips were always yellowy). There is also a clear demarcation between white and pink - something I never had before - so it almost looks like a french manicure but natural.I'm sold! If you're trying this and it's not working, give it 12 weeks with 3 x a day application and I think you will see a result.P.S. I decanted some of this into a smaller container to keep in my purse so I can use it during the day."
5,At the beginning of the pandemic I began using this on my nails. I feel like it does help strengthen my very thin nails.
5,Helped my thin nails grow relatively quick! Very easy to apply and scent isn’t overbearing.
5,I had never used this before but I recommend it to anyone.
5,Love this product
5,DON T KNOW ABOUT THE GROWTH YET BY MY NAILS FEEL BETTER AND I HAVE TRIED LOTS OF PRODUCTS OVER THE YEARS I DID NOT KNOW THERE WERE PEOPLE OUT THERE WITH NAILS AS BAD AS MINE I HOPE I CAN HAVE NAILS EVEN SHORT WITHOUT SPLITTING AND BRAKING
5,I like the moisturizing cream a lot but I can't attest to hardening my nails as of yet. But I have only been using it for three weeks. Excited to see if it strengthens them in future.
5,"All I have to say is if you’re have problems with your nails being soft and splitting, do yourself a favor and buy this product. My nails were in bad shape and I didn’t want to get fell nails, so I decided to try Hard as Hoof. After using for 3 weeks I really noticed a difference in my nails being longer and harder. My proof that it works was when I went to the nail salon and the manicurist paid me the best compliment by saying my nails were so beautiful before she put the polish on!!! I also love that it is not greasy and it has a pleasant coconut smell! I definitely recommend!"
5,My nails have never been this good
5,Love this my nails seem healthier than there we're no splitting or cracking due to acrylic nails.
5,"I was skeptical but, I gave this a try.  The product instantly hardened my nails! Bonus of helping my nail polish not chip!"
5,"This has made my nails stronger, I noticed a difference in just a couple of weeks. It’s easy to use, soaks in nicely and doesn’t feel greasy, and a little bit goes a long way.  It also smells nice. It’s part of my morning routine, while I wait for my computer to boot up."
5,I started using and love what has done for nails so far
5,"I really love this product. My nails are already pretty strong but they tend to tear when wet for long periods of time. I work with my hands alot and particularly in wet conditions. I feel this product definitely made them tougher, but also whiter and grow quicker. It smells wonderful and my skin loves it too. I rub it into my cuticles and over my knuckles as well and it makes them soft and rejuvenated!I feel like even using it every day it would last quite a while because a little goes a long way. Very pleased to have found this product!"
5,I love the smell easy to put on not grease y
5,"I've always bit at my cuticles and after my wedding (which is had fake nails on for), my nails were fragile to say the least. This stuff has my cuticles looking like I've never bit at them and my nails are so much stronger! I'm able to grow them out and they're not breaking, splitting, and peeling! I LOVE THIS STUFF! And an added bonus is that it smells like coconut!"
5,Fabulous product
5,"This product delivers on its promises.  My nails are much stronger after just a few weeks use.  Can't say I use it 3X a day as directed but I'm getting good results.  Note of caution to the fragrance sensitives - the coconut  scent is pretty strong.  Other than that, I highly recommend it."
5,I bought this for my mom. She liked the product and has used daily. She has suggested we also use it on our daughter's fingernails. So far so good!
5,"This product helped my winter cuticles to smooth and nails to become stronger.  Less breaking and cracking.  I didn't really buy it for my hands, but they are smoother also."
5,ease of use
5,"I waited a few weeks to write this so I had time to see results (or not see results lol)My nails have shown significant improvement in strength and moisture. I have always had issues with my nails getting brittle and breaking, doesnt help I live in the southwest desert of the US.THis stuff works great and smells good. Isnt too greasy either!"
5,"Love the scent, and my nails seem stronger."
5,"First of all whoever created this is amazing 👏🏾! My nails have been a flaming burning hot mess since the pandemic once I decided to stop wearing acrylic nails. They have been soft, brittle, not growing...could barely even add press on nails. I've been using this for about 3 weeks now and my nails are stronger, growing and they look normal. The skin around my nails are also smoother with minimum to no peeling (the minimum is bc of me bc I'll forget to moisturize after washing my hands)  it scent is amazing and my nails smile. I can feel it lol. Thank you for the great product. Customer forever!"
5,Highly recommend this ! My nails have always been flimsy and would peel. After about 3 weeks I can honestly say I've noticed a huge difference in my nails! They are so much stronger !
5,This stays on for weeks I love it!
5,I’ve not found anything I didn’t like about this. It also works great with other similar products.
5,I’m not a professional but I do the nails to many women in my family ;) and honestly WE LOVE AIMEILI
5,I really like this brand.  I have had great success using it with MEFA polish and it cures hard which I really like.  It is hard to get off however even with filing and acetone soaking.
5,"I used this base & top coat on my first true gel polish mani, and it turned out great. Would definitely purchase again."
5,"No sticky residue, smooth to the touch and lasts long, like 3 weeks once applied properly."
5,"bought it as a result of all them better tthan positive reviews, i was not at all disappointed! definitely recommended with no reservations!"
5,I’ve used a few brands from Amazon & hands on this is the best. It keeps my nails on for 2 weeks.
5,Beautiful finish and any one can use it. Just add over the nail and place under the light and go! Beat top gel EVER with a beautiful finish
5,For the first time I’ve found a set of base and top gel coats that work!
5,This is a good affordable gel nail it is a bit on the tick side. however it does stay shiny and hard.
5,"This polish absolutely makes your manicures last longer! Regular gel polish stays on my hands about 7 days before it starts chipping (I have super thin nails). When I used this polish as my top and base coats, my gel polish lasted for 3 weeks+! Amazing!"
5,"I personally loved the base and top coat so much, I placed a second order for my back up and also went with the matte coat. I love this brands matte and gloss finish. It's clean, it lasts long and doesn't leave a weird color after curing under UV lamp. Highly recommend."
5,A little goes a long way. This base and top coat make even my cheapest gel polish stay & not chip. Don’t pick or peel at nails because the top coat can pull off a layer of your real nails.
5,I love this product. The only flaw is I am used to changing polish colors frequently and with this it wears so long I don't change colors. So really not a bad thing at all
5,This top coat allows my nails to last for 2 weeks+! It’s priced great for the quality. Definitely will be purchasing again.
5,"They are easy to peel off without damaging your nail.So its good if you do them every week, probably wont stay longer than 7 days before peeling."
5,So far I have been very happy with this product!
5,The last gel top coat I purchased (from another website) was very thick and hard to apply. I bought this to try and absolutely love it. My nails came out so pretty. I would definitely buy again. Great product.
5,"I like that the top coat is not sticky, you take your hand away from the UV lamp and you are done!!!"
5,This is amazing product.
5,Love both base & top coat.
5,"Love this brand ! Works great , easy to apply , lasts longer than 2 weeks if that’s what you want . Easy to take off"
5,So in love with this gel. It is thick and gets into all the nooks and crannies. It was actually recommended by a nail tech on you tube (nailed by nikki) and I had to try.  So far I am loving this product!!! If you don't like thick gel this is not for you but trudt you won't regret this buy.
5,Great quality for the price. Convenient that you don’t have to use rubbing alcohol after use. My nails stay on really well using the base and top coat. Used with uv light.
5,This product is great
5,Great product
5,These are great !
5,The works so well
5,Nice gel. As expected.
5,These are perfect base and top coats for gel. I’ve gotten so many sets out of these and they’re no where near empty. Great shiny topcoat too.
5,Life saver😍
5,"Love the ease of these, it’s the best base and top coat you can find."
5,I like the product it’s a good shine and it lasts about two weeks I was pleased.
5,Love these top and base coat.
5,Best brand for top coat and base!! My favorite one
5,I love the base and top coat the only problem I’ve had is that the top coat came really lumpy but I’ve been working through it and just wiping the clumps off as I work. But over all they’re both great and last.
5,I’m just starting doing my own nail so this works fine to me. We’ll see how long it lasts
5,Cost effective
5,Works well with my Saviland builder gel. The top coat is true non-stick. Works with uv/led light. No problems!
5,Got this for my teenage granddaughter.  She loves it.Win for Grandma.
5,Love this top coat!  It stays shiny for at 2 to 3 weeks.
5,Good quality! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
5,This product worked amazingly well. After a minute under LED /UV it was dry. Very sheer and worked well with my polygel kit.
5,"this is just nails by Marie oak park mi. Ive been doing nails for 15 plus years. This product is worth the try. Base and top have a good  consistency, not runny and top coat very glossy. The top coat works well with nail art."
5,This is what I’ve used for over a year now. The price is great and it works really well. The bottles leak a bit so they have to be stored upright
5,Long lasting and great value
5,"Best gel top coat on the market!! Won't pool, sets hard , stays glossy for four weeks. Love!"
5,This gel polish lasts a long time. It's easy to apply and stays hard even when working in water often. Recommend it.
5,Works great! You definitely need to cure the base for about 90 sec plus to get a good stick. I have always had problems with my poly gel nails falling off and haven’t had that issue while using this product.
5,Top coat goes on nicely and leaves a nice shinny coat and is not sticky.
5,"The top coat really glistens! Looks so good only issue is it comes out too thick and therefore cures thick, and peels off much quicker.  Besides that, big fan."
5,Easy to use
5,seriously soooo good! i do my own gel nails/toes at home and this is by far the best set i’ve gotten. gel polish is definitely an art and takes a long time to master - if this set “lifts” you probably just aren’t doing your gel application correctly. these two are excellent! also added bonus you don’t need to wipe the top coat :)
5,"I have been doing my own gel mani’s with Aimeili base and top coat for years. The quality is consistently good. I’ve never had any problems. It’s a great price. Lasts at least a week even without primer, longer depending on how well executed the paint job is. I use 2-3x/month and each bottle will last about 5-6 months."
5,Easy to apply and remove
5,No complaints whatsoever! Lasted an entire week before chipping which was great for me because I use my hands more than the average person.
5,Easy to use works well.  Top coat feels a bit thick not sure if that’s normal for the no wipe formulas?
5,"Perfect to top my dip nails..Makes them have a super shiny finish, which lasts a very long time."
5,Works great and great price!
5,I work whole day and full time mom and this works great lasts 10 days!
5,"Works great! And super reasonable, I would buy again"
5,"Love ,love ,love. Very easy to apply and the topcoat is amazing. Week 3 and no chips on my nails. I have tried many other products,  but this is the BEST.  Highly recommend."
5,Great quality! They make my gel polish last at least a few weeks on my toes. Sometimes it’s a little difficult to get off when I want to change colors because it works that well. The top coat really is “no wipe”. Will definitely buy again when I run out!
5,Nice
5,I saw someone use the base as a “nail glue”. That is so smart and it actually works and lasts pretty long.. about 3 weeks to a month! It only dries in a lamp and dries pretty quick!
5,Brought for nail tech to use with the same line of gel polish that I got. Goes on easy. Does not burn (I put the gel on my natural nail and not acrylic) and it is comfortable.Happy with this line.
5,Love the product and the price as well :)
5,Update: I find that I use both the base and top coat no matter what polish I use. I often use the base coat instead of slip solution in various brands of polygel. I use the top coat to lighten gel polish.  I use both the base and top coat for multiple reasons._________The no wipe top coat has been working well with all brands of polygels I've used so far.
5,Easy to use and works great!
5,Love everything about this brand. Use all of their products...builder base is awesome! Polishes are very good. I’m a repeat customer and a very happy one. The price is unbeatable. Never had an issue. Cruelty free. Customer for life.
5,Great base and top coat for gel nails
5,I like the brushes on these better than any polishes I’ve used. Very good for acrylics or press-ons cause they’re wide and require less strokes so less chances of messing up. They kind of smell bad though. Top coat shines like glass!
5,Best no wipe top coat love it never stops shining
5,Perfect
5,First time using gel. Really like it
5,Love this. Works great.
5,Will be purchasing again because its the only coat that works for me. Love it
5,It’s my first time doing gel nails at home and these are great! Both are easy to apply and the top coat really looks amazing. 60 seconds of cure time and my nails looks shiny and the color is consistent. Love it!
5,Absolutely love this product it sets fast under the uv light
5,This is a great product. Just don't apply more than two coats of this or it'll peel off.
5,Loved it!
5,love product
5,Great for beginners. Works well
5,"I wouldn't be writing a review if amazon did remind me but this product is great. It runs out quickly if you live with 5 others who like to do their nails for free :'( but it's great plus buying separately cost too MUCHHH. Hope this helps. Oh yeah, cures quickly and does the job flawlessly, if it doesn't cure properly- keep yo lamp, it's DEADDDD.~Thank you"
5,I really love using these gel polishes. The top coat doesn’t leave a sticky residue unlike other top gels!
5,"I bought these in an attempt to upkeep my nails without going to the shop... although I was worried I wouldn't get the ""filing"" right it was very easy. My polish lasts up to 2-3 weeks and I dont wear gloves for washing (which I should), the shine last right up until I take it off :)"
5,"This item is a great price for the two bottles. And it a product that I like because of the no wipe top coat, and it give a nice shiny finish."
5,Great product for a great price. Cures well. No complaints here!
5,Don’t waste your money on any other top and base coat because this is the only set you’ll need . I’ve tried others on Amazon and this one is by far the best one !
5,Good product...I would buy again!
5,"I’ve been using these products for a few months now and I love them! Super easy to use and I love that the top coat is no wipe. Don’t be alarmed if you’ve never done gel nails yourself, the base and layers will feel sticky even after curing before you put on the top coat. Once the top coat is on, everything hardens and looks beautiful!"
5,worked so well!
5,I am new to the DIY UV lamp. This is a must have for UV gel! Make sure your nails are clean and dry before you put the base coat (wiping with alcohol works well). Would recommend and buy again
5,"Super shiny, lasts 2-3 weeks on dip nails. I do the dip process but don't use their top coat instead I do one layer of base coat, uv light for 90 seconds the one layer of top coat then uv light for 90 seconds. Normal for base coat to be tacky after uv light."
5,"This works great, I am so pleased. Will buy this again."
5,"Don’t listen to any negative reviews on this product!! People are complaining that it’s hard to take off but that just means it actually stays on.. which is the point?? Totally worth the buy, I’ve bought so many types and had so many failures and can honestly say this is the best I’ve seen out there for at home manicures! Buy it"
5,"works really well, cured perfectly under a uv light for 2 mins, easy to use:)"
5,LOVE this brand!!! love the base coat and top coat!!!
5,Great product. Use it on a regular basis!
5,I've purchased this set a few times now and will continue to purchase. Works great for base and top coat on my gel nails.
5,"Easy to use, not super thick which I liked. So far I’ve gotten at least 7 days out of my manicures, and they stay looking shiny."
5,Works great. Happy with purchase.
5,Really good too coat. I was nervous at first but the top coat really seals the nail I love it!
5,"The best top coat, so shiny and nice and cures super quickly!"
5,Amazing! Lasts the longest out of anything I’ve tried!
5,Very impressed with how quickly it cures and looks great!
5,I love this top and base coat. This is my second repurchase. I love how the top coat does not need to be wiped with rubbing alcohol and it dries not tacky. It is the perfect consistency - not too thin and not too thick. It dries/cures perfectly for me when I leave my nails under the light for one minute and thirty seconds.
5,A friend recommended this specific top and base coat because she loves them and I totally agree.  She let me borrow hers and then I ended up buying my own set.  I have bought this set again because it works great.  It lasts well.  Goes on smooth and easy.  Hardens up quickly with the uv light.  I wouldn't use another kind because i know this one works so well.
5,works great
5,Great base and tip coat!! Lasts atleast 3 weeks for me!!
5,Is very easy and good but the brush need to be more thinner
5,"This is the best I have used, my gel nail polish last 2 weeks with out any lifting, chips or damage to my nail polish."
5,"This is the best base and top gel polish I’ve tried. It cures hard, it’s super shiny, and removes easily with acetone and a cuticle pusher. It does burn if you have cuts on your fingers or bite your nails, however"
5,Great value and great product
5,I was skeptical at first of this bc of the price and had never heard of the brand... but seriously the best I’ve used yet!I do my own dip nails at home but was never happy with the top coat that went with the brands I used. I tried their gels top coats too and they kept chipping or getting dull so I decided to look elsewhere for a base+top gel combo.I’m two weeks on my set and it’s still SO SHINEY and no chips! I’m so impressed. Only complaint is it’s not one of those self leveling ones so make sure you get a nice thin and even coat before going under the light
5,I love this brand these are amazing
5,"While the polish is great, every bottle I've ever had from them, 4, ALL HAVE LEAKED when on their side."
5,Exactly what I needed with me UV light. I love this purchase
5,I’ve tried A LOT of clear gel Polish but this is by far my favorite!! It is durable as I’m a welder and am hard on my hands. This lasts for a long time and it’s still easy to remove. Super happy with my purchase. Will definitely but again!
5,Works great with the LED nail dryer lamp
5,These are great and they work too
5,Cheap but works great and kast a long time
5,Very thick but easy to use
5,Consistently great product. Long lasting and easy to apply
5,"So far I have had two coats and one top coat on for over two weeks with no major issues! I did this as a fill on my old gel nails, only had a couple mistakes and they were so easy to file and fix! I have received so many compliments on how natural they look (left them clear) They are very hard and hold up great!"
5,I was scared at first because it Was still tacky after curing under UV light but I read it’s supposed to be so polish will stick. Continued with my nail routine and it turned out well! Really great product especially for the price!!
5,love these they work great
5,This is good quality and not too thick like other brands. Nice no wipe feature and decent size bottles.
5,I have purchased no wipe clear polish before and this is by far the best one that I have found. Very easy to use my nails are super shiny and they last very long.
5,"It’s a good top and base, but my top coat is turning yellow and I’m unsure why."
5,Protects and very long-lasting. Honestly can’t complain at all
5,I bought those gel sticker and they always crack after a few while. Got this one to seal the top and it worked perfectly. Last longer on my nails and no stinky smell
5,"The absolute best base & top coat, do not wipe base coat after curing under UV lamp, just apply color coat(s) cure, then use & cure the top coat. There’s no mess or fuss. Professional quality polish, no one will know you didn’t spend a ton at the salon. And I haven’t had any chipping or lifting since I started using this pair. Works great on natural nails as well as acrylic tips & gel nails."
5,"This! I can’t even begin! This is an amazing base and top coat my nails lasted! It was easy to use, and great for gels!I love it"
5,I love this product its so easy to use and leaves my nails shiny
5,Goes on so smooth and easy! This makes polish last a long time and minimizes chipping! Top coat is not sticky so there’s no need for wiping with alcohol after wards!
5,love these  products !
5,This is my favorite base & top coat set. I definitely wish that they made bigger bottles or maybe a refill bottle because I literally have to order a new set every week. I go through them too quickly and having the option to just refill my bottle would be so amazing.
5,Looks amazing! Easy to use and yes!  No wipe !
5,"For dip nails, so I use dip powders and I used these to top off my nails because nothing was leaving a shine like I wanted it to.  I need my normal steps and then did one coat base and cured and then did the top coat and cured.  😮 holy cow so much shine and easy to use!  Makes my nail super smooth too!  Will repurchase!"
5,"I was skeptical when I saw just how compact the bottles were, but these work great! My gel manicure lasts about two weeks and even then I could stretch to a little more if my cuticles didn’t need to be trimmed. Make sure to prep the nail correctly, give each layer the proper cure time under the lamp and it’ll last!For the base and top coats, I cure for 60 seconds and that has been sufficient time."
5,I would buy it again. Beats having to use nail polish remover in the end. Best quality I’ve ever used at home. Nails come out looking professional. Very easy to use. I recommend it.
5,"I love this base coat and top coat.  They apply smoothly with little effort and cure quite rapidly.  It lasts at least 2 weeks for me and looks professional.  I am not very talented at applying nail polish, but AIMEILI makes my nails look like I am."
5,"This is really good, it lasts so long and is so easy to use. It doesn’t require too much time under a UV light. I used it for my poly gel nails and it allowed it to last 2 weeks and I’m sure it will last longer. Works well with everything, very happy with product."
5,I wish I could review the actual product but I couldn’t even get the bottle open. It’s like it was superglued shut.Edit: my friend was able to open it first try. I’m just weak. My bad. Great polish.
5,"Truly is a no wipe polish, and it has a great shine to it, so far it’s holding up pretty well."
5,Omg I love it and it last forever it’s so worth it
5,Excellent line of products!! They work as well as the professional salon products!  I’m pleased to use it at home :) Remember as with all polishes store upright.
5,"I’m using this for something other than nails, but it’s awesome for my art project!"
5,Still learning how to do my own mani. These look best with very thin layers.
5,I bought this due to the fact it was on sale and I was like why not. This is probably my favorite base coat/top coat at the moment. It goes on without any issues. It’s seriously a no wipe top coat. It’s all around a good product. I use a lot of different gel products so this one is definitely 10/10
5,"I have used and repurchased twice now. I absolutely love this product used with my color street strips. I apply the base, cure, color street then top and cure again.I get two weeks of wear easily."
5,YAY! Finally a lower price gel top and base that actually work. Affordable and not goopy.
5,"Super easy to apply, formula is great, quality is great. I'm impressed with the quality of these polishes. Will be buying again in the future!"
5,Great product and price!
5,Works well with my UV/LED lamp 168 watts
5,Nice polish. I really like this brand. Stays on and colors are nice
5,Very good product. Will buy again.
5,Good product
5,"I just started to do my own nails because of Covid.  Im 70 (actually 71 but don't tell anyone :-) and am not that ""techie"" but using gel polish and the LED light I purchased is easy.  To be honest, Im not sure what the ""base"" does but every site says to use it, so I do.  However, I can tell that  the top coat works well.  One coat is all you need, however, I use 2 coats.  The trick to gel polish products is that less is best.  A thin coat is much better than thicker application.  I actually use a thinner a lot.  I definitely recommend this product!"
5,Easy to use and has a nice longevity! Impressed with the quality.
5,Loved this product!
5,"These are my go to base and top coat. It helps my gel manicure last for several weeks.  I’ve purchased more expensive brands at the beauty store and always come back to this one.Make sure you use a thin coat of the base coat.  Check cuticles for excess top coat before placing into the light; otherwise, it will cause your skin to get hot and burn."
5,"I have been going to my local beauty supply to purchase my gel polish and they have not had supplies in a while.  I decided to buy on line and this had good reviews so I thought I'd try it!  I'll never go back to the other brand I used to buy!  this is FANTASTIC and at this price you can't go wrong!  my polish lasted longer than the other brands and still has a great shine!  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product!  I'm going to purchase the polishes."
5,"No wipe off needed. Long lasting and stays shiny for 1-2 weeks. When you want to remove it, let your nails soak in nail polish remover and cover it with aluminum sheets or nail clips for 15 minutes and it’ll easily come off. The yellow stain that some reviews mentioned can be removed if you let it soak well."
5,Love this product works great cures in 30secs. Would recommend 2 anyone who wants stronger lasting 💅 nails
5,This product holds the gel polish so well i do have difficulty removing it
5,Beautiful topcoat and basecoat definitely would recommend to Everyone has a beautiful shine and dries in 20 seconds or less no wiping needed
5,"Definitely beginner friendly. I’ve never done gel nail, especially at home, so I was a little nervous. But it was extremely easy & straight forward & came out amazing! Very impressed. I would recommend reading the instructions on the Amazon listing, as well as some of the reviews. They had some good tips as well. Following that, it was very simple & came out looking salon quality."
5,Best product I have used is far. This is going to be my go to brand from here on out! Easy to apply and simple instructions to follow for timing based on what you are using to cure them.
5,The polish is long lasting and the top coat adds a nice shine to the nails.
5,Lasted a good amount of time (2.5weeks) and I picked at it! Super shiney and easy to use.
5,Works well. I will be repurchasing in the future
5,"Been doing my own gel nails for the last few months.  Purchased this product due to all of the positive reviews.  I am impressed for the price point how long lasting this product is.  Very easy to use, even for a beginner.  Just repurchased a second pack because I don't want to run out.  Can't really tell how much is left in the bottle."
5,"Im impressed! I’m not a gel nail expert by any means, but this worked great!"
5,Great product for fingernails
5,"I was pretty skeptical, but as soon as I applied and cured the top coat it was perfect. Only been about four days but it still looks great, no peeling or anything. Definitely recommend!"
5,"I have been using the same crappy pairs of nail clippers forever. Finally decided to make an investment in some nice ones. These feel sturdy, like they won't fall apart like the ones you get at the drugstore. They're very sharp and comfortable to use. Very happy I purchased these."
5,The best clipper I’ve ever owned.
5,"After trying several nail clippers with poor results, I bought this set.Best nail clippers I’ve ever owned. Easy too use, very sharp, comes with a sealing plastic pouch.I would definitely buy this product again. Top Quality!"
5,"Easy to hold, easy to use, and very sturdy for tough nails.  Great price on a quality product. 5 stars!"
5,"Excellent product, great design.  Light years ahead of your basic grocery store model."
5,Nice set of nail and toenail clippers.  Feels nice in your hand. Effortlessly clips my nails.
5,"Well-made, much better quality than the usual clippers you find at the drug store"
5,I’ve had several nail cutters that hurt my hand while cutting and cut the nail in a way that they split. These are great! Finally have cutters that work!
5,These are the best nail clippers I've owned. By far. They hold easily and comfortably and make crisp cuts
5,Super sharp and very well made. Makes grooming a breeze.
5,"I have always been a tightwad and purchased the cheap nail clipping sets. You know the ones! I decided to step up my nail game and purchased these from a friend's recommendation. As soon as I grabbed hold and made the first cut, I knew these clippers were 100X better than the crud I had used previously. Best clippers ever!"
5,"After the first use, they clipped well, felt really good in the hand, and also felt very sturdy. Much better than any other clippers I’ve used."
5,"These feel heavy and solid in your hands. The blades are SHARP and make a good, clean cut. No light, flimsy dull clippers here."
5,"Although most nail clippers are good when they’re new, some cheap ones seem to dull rather quickly. I’ve used these clippers several times and the sharpness of the edges seems brand new!"
5,Worked well with a nice sharp edge. These are my favorite clippers.
5,"High quality, sharp clean cuts."
5,Thank you
5,Love you these.  Plus they have a nice little pouch to hold them.And a lifetime warranty!!!
5,I thought these were very well built.  It felt heavier and more sturdy than the ones I have bought in the past.
5,"highly satisfied! They are sharp, nice size, easy to use. Just what I was looking for."
5,"JUST WHAT I HOPED FOR, ESPECIALLY THE BIG ONE FOR THE TOES.  BOTH CUT SHARPLY, NOT CRUSHING THE NAIL"
5,"I like these clippers. Easy to use - don't slip, and sharp enough to get through tough nails. I like them!"
5,The clippers are very sharp and cut quickly & easily - glad I believed the reviews!
5,"These are so much better than every other pair of nail clippers we have acquired over the years. Strong, sharp, comfortable, easy to use. Highly recommended, especially if you have super thick toe nails!"
5,They aren't the sharpest and you do end up having to file your nails but they are definitely durable clippers that have built in filers which helps a lot. I would buy these again for the price.
5,Best clippers that I've ever used. Makes it so much easier especially on the toenails. Love it and highly recommend it.
5,"Since my stroke clipping my nails has been very difficult.  I couldn't press hard enough to clip the nails, and the clippers kept slipping out of my hands. When I got these clippers I was amazed by the difference! Easy to hold, easy to use, I highly recommend this product!"
5,"Everything about this product is top notch, from the outer packaging to the prodcuct build quality - the best clippers I have ever purchased. And even though this isn't a high tech piece of equipment, the after sales customer service is on par, if not better, with what you would expect from a high end electronics company!great job all round AAA+++"
5,I would say it is noticeably better than my cheap run of the mill clippers. Actually hated clipping toe nails because of sensitivity from years ago cutting to close. These give you better and I mean better control and have me looking forward to cutting both Mani and Pedicure.If you're on the fence especially if you are use to really cheap pairs go ahead and pencil these badboys in. Plus they come with a small pouch to store them in which was a bonus. Would definitely buy again and highly recommend.
5,Very easy to hold.  There's a little spot if gritty stuff that comfortab L y keeps your fingers from slipping.  I might order another set just in case.
5,"Very smooth working, they are sharp and they do a neat job of clipping my nails.  Best clippers I have for fingernails."
5,"Love them, high quality and easy to use!"
5,cuts very thick nails with ease
5,Easy to hold and use for old hands
5,Best nail clippers I've ever had.
5,"I bought these to replace an old TRIM set that I had. Apparently the quality of the newer TRIM sets are not even close to the older ones. So, I thought I would try these Harperton and I have to say I am not disappointed. The quality and sturdiness of these are outstanding not to mention extremely sharp! I would highly recommend them."
5,It very sharp compared to other nail clippers I owned. I really like it.
5,Love my new nail clippers. Easy to hold. Good cutting edge.
5,"This is my first Amazon product review, can't believe it's about nail clippers.  Such a silly thing right? I mean, they are nail clippers, have different can one product be from the other? Incredibly different!!! These are far and away the best finger and toenail clippers I have ever used.  They are super sharp, easy to grip, well built and do a fantastic job.  I ordered one for home and one to leave in our travel bag.  I will be ordering more sets for upcoming Christmas ""joke"" gifts.  However, the jokes on them once they try these clippers!!!"
5,Super happy with these nail clippers. Such an improvement over cheap clippers. Totally recommend these. Very comfortable and controllable.
5,I like how sharp they are and how easy they are to compress. They cut fingernails and toenails beautifully.
5,Easy to use. Nice handle grips.  Good quality stainless steel.
5,"Rec have used, blades lined up well for good cut. Very sharp fit well in my hamd"
5,If you've got thickened nails this is a good set of clippers.
5,sharp works GREAT
5,"As the title states, I should’ve bought these clippers years ago.  I’ve dealt with sub-par clippers all my life and didn’t even know there was a premium product on the market, until I bought these.  The power and precision of the cut is just amazing."
5,very nice dont fall out of my hands
5,"opening is wide enough to clip thick, rough toenails.  the best I've ever used."
5,"These Harperton nail clippers are very impressive. They are very high quality, sharp and easy to manipulate. Much better than those found at the local drugstore. A terrific purchase!"
5,"Never thought to upgrade my nail clippers, but I’m glad I did! These razor sharp trimmers  actually live up to the hype. Precise, sturdy, and don’t leave jagged edges. The built in file is a nice touch!5 stars… would recommend."
5,I have never owed a quality set of nail clippers before and these certainly fit the bill! Would buy again in a heartbeat.
5,Works great!! The best nail clippers we have ever used!!
5,"I originally ordered these for myself, but they worked so well, I ordered an additional set for my husband."
5,Very good hefty clippers
5,They are sharp and easy to use
5,These are very sharp and cut easily. They are pretty easy to hold.
5,"These nail clippers are very heavy duty and will last a very long time. I love having 2 sizes of clippers. I've now purchased a set for every member of my household. These might be difficult for a person with very weak hands (a child, due to old age or arthritis) because they are heavy duty. For your average teen or adult they are great and work very well."
5,Easy to hold. The whole family loves them.
5,Nicest set of clippers I've ever owned. They even have a built in emory board on the underside of the handles!
5,Quality set. Comes with nice storage Bag. Recommended!
5,These are easy to use and sharp. I would recommend them to everyone who wants great quality clippers.
5,The small one is good enough for me.
5,"Love these. Well made, easy to hold and very sharp. Nothing like the clippers I’ve bought at the local pharmacy over the years. They look like they will last for years."
5,"Great nail clippers, and phenomenal customer service. Will definitely buy more Harperton clippers!"
5,Best clippers ever. Will never buy anything else but these. Reasonable price and great quality!
5,"Never really thought I’d write a review on nail clippers but these things rock. They are clearly quality made and they are sharp! You almost have to be careful when you’re using them! If these ever wear out or get lost, I will buy another set, anything else isn’t going to live up now."
5,This pair are sturdy and will not fall apart. My husband has a hard time keeping track of small things so the yellow is a plus. Makes them easier to find. Come in a nice case for traveling.
5,"These nail clippers are perfect. They don’t require a ton of pressure to cut. They are easy to hold and easy to use.  They are sharp. They are durable. So good, I bought a second set."
5,"Quality clippers; sharp, easy to use."
5,This is hands down the best set of Nail clippers I have ever owned. I am very particular about clippers since most are so poorly made. These are worth every penny! Just be exceptionally careful because they are sharp
5,My only regret with these clippers is I hadn’t found them before now .  These are perfect for my husband who has strong thick nails .  They are easy to hold  and are heavy duty !
5,"Took me until my 40's to learn to buy one quality product instead of countless cheapies over the years, especially when it comes to taken for granted day-to-day products.Love these clippers. Solid quality, clean cutting. Don't expect to need customer service, but they were quick to check in to make sure everything was good.Well worth the money."
5,"Bought these to replace a bunch of old, worn out nail clippers. These are made well and feel like they will last years. The blades are lined up properly and give very clean cuts."
5,They seem like good clippers to me. They feel good in my hands and easy to hold. The blades make a clean cut and seam very sharp. I'd recommend this product to my friends.
5,"These clippers cut very well and are very sharp. The larger clipper also is available as a straight edge, which is my preference. Other clippers I have bought do not cut as well as these clippers. They come in a convenient storage bag. Customer service is outstanding. I highly recommend this company.  You will not be disappointed."
5,I could feel the difference immediately just picking up the clippers.  They are very ergonomic and solid.  I found it very easy to clip my nails with a precision never before experienced with the average drugstore clippers used in the past.  I will never go back to those again.
5,"Best clippers I've found yet! No more cheap ones for my family. Easy to use, comfortable shape for holding in your hand, and sharp. Well made!"
5,These are the best clippers I’ve ever bought.
5,"In my book every man needs their own pair of super strong sturdy finger AND toe nail clippers. My bf love these and doesn’t even lose them now. They are super durable and I think they look super expensive. They way they work seems like they would be. I’ve gifted this to 2 other guys other than my bf and they love them, lol."
5,Easy to use and very effective clippers for tough nails!
5,The product is well made and works terrific.
5,Work great. Sharp and strong.
5,Flat out the best clippers I have ever used let alone owned. For in my hands well. Easy to use. Sturdy. Nuff said.
5,These are the best nail clippers I have ever used.  Very sturdy and sharp.  Easy to handle
5,"Wow! These nail clippers are heavy! In the good way. They’re well crafted, and easy to use. Sorry I can’t tell you much more, my son took both of the clippers, and I haven’t seen them since! Both pairs, really? He loves them, and ended up throwing all the other many clippers we were collecting. The price is excellent, considering the quality of both nail clippers."
5,"Sturdy, sharp and well made"
5,These clippers cut easy and accurate. They are now my favorite and come in a handy pouch
5,The thing I like most is how sharp they are and easy to use
5,Great clippers. Only think I regret is not getting a second set.
5,"These clippers give a sharp, smooth cut with minimal effort. I really like the grip. It's really comfortable  & easy to squeeze. I also appreciate the little yellow bag that holds the clippers. I never have to dig through the drawer to find them. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these or buy another set for travel, etc."
5,"These are sharp and well shaped for both toe and fingernails.  The arm on top moves every time I use them, which makes it difficult to trim with one hand. I don’t know why these have so much play in them, or if it is just a weird thing with this Pair."
5,Heavy duty and excellent product.
5,"Works great, smells great. Just a great product!"
5,"I have bought this cologne a few years ago, and I loved it since then."
5,Really good smell
5,"Stuff smells amazing.But its not a magic wand...  it will open the door to conversation, its an ice breaker for sure when out trying to meet someone new you will know who is interested in you immediatly and the rest is up to you.Now if you have someone you know is already into you this will make them go crazy.I would best describe this as a confidence inhancer ! I tend to be alot bolder when wearing this."
5,"I had a patient at my urgent care who smelled INCREDIBLY good. I intentionally kept walking past him until I built up the courage to ask what cologne he was wearing. I immediately added it to my Amazon cart! My only complaint is that you have to use a lot more than ""normal"" to make it noticeable and keep it lasting all day."
5,"I love this cologne, all though I would call it an oil. I use it by itself, or I mix it with my other colognes. I call it dressing my nose, but anyway, goes great with my natural body odor. Women always compliment me on how good I smell. I do suggest layering it to make it kind of enhance the cologne your wearing. It goes best with brighter scents, but it also compliments more manly scents like Dior Saavage. So I give this a 5. I am def going to buy again. NO CAP!!!"
5,"It is a solid cologne just for the wonderful light and long lasting smell, and it gets double points for the pheromones which my girlfriend can't get enough of!"
5,It smells amazing and came just in time for my vacation!
5,Couple sprays before going out and noticed right away a different attitude or approach from the opposite sex. Not the most fragrant but apparently effective via the airwaves as attractiveness potential increased noticibly. Not clear the science and your mileage may vary but its worth a purchace to try out and or stock up so youre always ready.
5,Amazing product. Amazing service
5,My girlfriend loves the smell of this cologne and so do I.I have ordered it for the second time.Be careful not to apply too much because peoples noses are quite sensitive.Too much of a good thing can also hurt you.
5,Great product for men who already have swagger and confidence. This just makes it easier.
5,"She likes the smell, will update you tonight if it takes into effect.  Also, she has no idea what I'm wearing, but so far my butt has been grabbed 3 times"
5,Love this cologne! Highly recommend!
5,"Amazing stuff, put it on and my wife loves it. Will definitely be making another purchase of this chick magnet scent!! Wow"
5,This men’s cologne smells so good and lasts so long. The scent blends with the wearers natural smell and gives a great essence. My man got this to wear and I fell in love with the scent!
5,I like the smell of it and so do others
5,Smells great i like this cologne a lot
5,I like that it isnt overpowering. My interactions with people are much more positive.
5,I wasn’t too sure what to expect trying out this product and trying to go a more natural route in life. I was extremely surprised at how great this scent was and my wife greatly approved as well ☺️
5,Has a great scent that last a long time.
5,Loved this product! it was amazing 🔥
5,"I did not expect tht this cologne would smell so good! My friends (girls) asks what I’m wearing as they haven’t smelled this before.It last long enough and you have to apply two sprays unlike perfumes, just a tiny drop is fine. Overall I am satisfied"
5,Great product. Smells great and seems to be noticed by my wife.
5,"Love the scent, lasts longer than other brand cologne"
5,Ladies love it and smells great last all day
5,smell amazing
5,"Normally wouldn’t buy cologne without a test smell, but this is surprisingly good!"
5,Not bold and overbearing. It has a very nice and pleasant fragrance.
5,I give 5 stars. No dislikes.
5,"The scent smells good, but at times people have to be really close to smell the scent."
5,I just purchased it and it smells very good - masculine yet not overpowering. Not sure how the Pheromone qualities work but hopefully I’ll know more soon. Wish me luck!
5,"Freshness smell and longevity all day this product is worth trying , I would purchase it again"
5,I like the smell. Very smooth.
5,"It’s good stuff, I am happy with it, i bought it as a experiment, now I want something stronger though."
5,"Great product, great service!"
5,Honestly one of my favorites. I've been using it for years and I doubt I'll ever change it. Definitely give it a try.
5,"Gets compliments all the time more than any other cologne I've ever tried, it's kind of weird actually."
5,I subscribe to this stuff.  I get compliments from men and women all the time for how good I smell.  This stuff also lasts much longer than normal cologne.  It mixes really  well with other scents too which helps to shake it up sometimes.  This is worth it!
5,Smells amazing
5,"I was skeptical too, y'all. A cologne that attracts woman to you? No way. But my first test came when I stepped into the office this morning. My boss (female) is at he reception desk taking tempetures before you enter the office (covid), and she didn't compliment my scent or anything, but she started talking to me. And she would not stop. Even as I was trying to ease away to go to my desk she just kept trying to talk to me. Now I don't know if it was me subconsciously or what, but not just the females, the entire office was in a good mood with me. I'm not going to say that this cologne puts everyone around you in a good mood, but there is certainly a difference in the way people acted toward me yesterday versus today. Try it for yourself and see."
5,"Can't make this up, but literally every girl noticed something ""different"" about me and wanted to be near me. I tried switching back to my normal cologne, no results, switched back to raw chemistry and girls noticed really fast. Don't know what it is, but all I know is that it works. This is my second bottle and I'll be coming back for more. The scent does last long, even when you think it wears off, it's still there. I've tried other pheromone colognes but this one is my favorite and girls definitely notice, trust me. Give it a try!"
5,I really liked the smell
5,"Great scent, subtle yet gets noticed in the right way"
5,Great product. Smells good and last for a long time.
5,Smells great and not to oily on the skin.
5,"Good stuff, been using it regularly for 4 plus years.Reasonably priced also, wife likes it also 😉"
5,"I am not much of a cologne guy, but I came across this one a few years back and have been using this since then. It has always been good to me with no overpowering smell and it does last long for the days."
5,Useful and a great deal.
5,"The scent was very nice, didn’t smell like alcohol. I can tell that a couple of women enjoyed the scent as well. Value was great compared to others!"
5,"I have no idea if the pheromone thing is legit, but for $25 this is a great cologne. I alternate between this and Dior Sauvage and even prefer it over Versace Eros."
5,"GREAT product! This is my 3rd bottle. I'd like to advise the shipper to be careful, this last one leaked out, into my box."
5,"Smells good, seems to last awhile and the lady loves it. Score!"
5,Smells great 👍🏼
5,Love it this Cologne stays fresh all day
5,My husband LOVES this cologne!  He educated ME about it wow!  Anyway awesome company.  Very attentive to my needs.  No complaints here.  Thanks guys!
5,Men and women at work are friendlier at work when I wear this. Very interesting social experiment!
5,"Great great Scent, is so pleasant!"
5,"I believe that the item ,  besides smelling well , does not necessarily make a huge impact on its own pheromones wise. I believe One has to take care of himself and start feeling confident. The product might give a false impression you are more attractive  because you might feel more confident . I still have not obtained much success with my wife that , besides liking its smell, did not seem extra excited about it. Maybe down the road the time will cause it’s effect to happen. Still waiting. However it is a good item . The box is beautifully crafted and the cologne smells really good."
5,Great smell! Not over bearing. Have only worn it out once but got a few compliments. Excited to continue to use it and see how much attention I attract.
5,"I'm a skeptic, and was skeptical, but this not only smells great, but really works! It took about a day, but I've noticed it in my wife and pretty much every female I interact with is kinder and responds to me more positively than usual. I didn't even notice at first, but there's definitely a distinct difference. Makes me wonder what kind of lame pheromones I've been giving off all these years! :-) Great product!"
5,"I am incredibly satisfied with the product, I wasn't looking for something inexpensive just something that worked, somehow I found both"
5,Nice for a gift
5,It smell great and I went out and I was hit on by a pretty lady
5,I like the scent.
5,"Scent is great. It’s a sadly small package though, only 1oz. Otherwise it’s great so far."
5,This smells great and my girl loves the smell as well
5,Nice smell
5,"Scent initially smells good, will update this review about it’s efficacy after some time."
5,Work like expected lady love the smell
5,This is my bf cologne and I love it. I had to buy a bottle for myself and I use it to make my room smell good. It’s dreamy
5,"I really did enjoy this, I typically like more fresh and clean scents, this is kinda darker and musky but it isnt like any other darker musky scent that I've experienced before it blends really well and isnt too heavy for me. For the price definitely worth a try"
5,I love the smell and the packaging. I cannot wait to use my cologne today.
5,"This Smells just as good as the expensive colognes you can find at the mall. Has a great masculine woody scent. I don’t know if the pheromones work, but I definitely get compliments on the smell. Will definitely purchase again."
5,I like the feel of the product and the fragrance is pleasing by imparting the freshness of just getting out of the shower. It lasts a long time and the lingering scent is pleasing on worn clothing.Thank you!
5,"It smells amazing. Light but masculine, lasts a long time and you honestly can't beat the price.. It's a little oily so I would definitely recommend spraying it directly on your body rather than your clothes to avoid the risk of it staining your clothes."
5,So far the cologne is pretty good with a good smell that isn't so overwhelming and last all day.
5,"The smell is amazing, cute bottle, nice packaging"
5,Smells great and works!!
5,Smells good. Wish it would long last.
5,The scent is very nice and not too pungent. Great value.
5,"If you need this for certain....... Purposes, it does work very well at attracting certain females. They may not be the kind that ya bring home to meet the folks, but they definitely invoke a good time!"
5,I love this product. I use one spray per day and it’s lasted me almost 6 months only going halfway through the bottle. The scent is great and I’ve gotten several compliments from women on it.
5,It’s good
5,"Great smell, very little goes a long way and it lasts all day.  This is bottle #5 for me."
5,Great product!!! Great smell!!! Will definitely order again. And yes it really works!!
5,"First and foremost, it smells good and masculine. People seem to notice the pleasant scent and say I smell nice."
5,I love everything with the best results
5,"This works no joke I usually buy Gucci, Versace , etc.But this here is the best mild smell last all day as it’s oil based my wife can’t stay off me always asking for a kiss coming behind me to give me hugs saying ily man this work must buy on my 2nd buy and will be replacing my collection."
5,Great product for what you're paying
5,Very good
5,Perfect for what I needed!!
5,"Nothing attracts a woman like a good a personality and a bit of confidence, however the cologne smells great and i found it did make me feel a little more confident which may go a long way. I think it's a great buy but it is no magic spray."
5,"Was excited to see what this may do, I tried it on myself and 2 others, all of us wound up with a separate scent, which is amazing. The smell isn’t super strong where your eyes start to water, it’s subtle and light. Perfect."
5,She has been acting like a giddy school girl ever since I put it on. She is next to me laughing trying to contain herself but is losing control. I will definitely be buying this again!
5,Bought this a couple years ago and it just smells amazing! It lasts all day long and definitely attracts the fairer sex
5,Great scent and it last quite a long time!
5,"I like this product it's not overpowering really mellow, smells can good, will recommend for others to but."
5,Great smell. Last for a long time. I get a lots of complements and I always get ask what perfume do I used. I keep it as a secret and love that the smell is not overwhelming.
5,"Put the spray on, and about 10 mins later my fiance could smell it and asked if I put it on. Than proceeded to lay on me and now she's waiting for me to finish this 😅Guys if you want to have some fun, buy this. It's definitely worth a rebuy"
5,Thought it was a hoax. Smells great! Works as intended wife loves it!
5,I love the scent of the product and it pairs very well with other cologne for a more varied experience.
5,"Great product, Im on my 6th bottle works well with my regular cologne. Has a really appealing smell"
5,Just recieved the product but really like it.  The scent is mellow and pleasant. My wife loves it.
5,"It has a little to no scent at all, which is a plus because you can wear any perfume on it if you like.I didn’t really need it, but it’s nice to wear to to see what it is like."
5,Love the scent. Natural manly scent.
5,* Very affordable cologne* Smells very good* Scent stays on my skin a long time
5,"Scent is great,  seems to go well with my body chemistry.  Can't wait to see how long the scent last on me."
5,"This cologne smells like pure confidence. It’s not too overpowering, but has just the right potency to get people smelling you. The chemistry of the this fragrance mixes well with your sweat and makes the ladies go crazy!"
5,"This product smells so good, and lasts so long. I love it, and recommend it for any male looking to smell better and attract more woman."
5,Love this product! Got immediate results the first time I applied it! The wife noticed and was immediately drawn to me!!
5,This cologne smells really great. I will test if it actually attracts woman tomorrow when I go out!
5,"I was skeptical of this product for sure, but in my small, not so scientific sample, here’s what I found:1. Whenever I wear this around my fiancée, after catching a whiff of it, she immediately drags me to bed to “cuddle”. Every time!2. When I wear this at parties, I get attention. LOTS of attention- but not just from ladies. From pretty much everyone- older people, younger people, men and women alike. This stuff is dangerous, and made my fiancée very aware about how much attention I was receiving, and voiced her displeasure. Lol!If I had to describe the scent, it would be “what the coolest guy at the club smells like after an hour on the dance floor”. It’s musky, but definitely in a good way"
5,Overall worked great I loved it and so did those around me
5,For the price this product has a really good smell and since it does have an oil type base the fragrance last longer than standard colognes.
5,"Good smell, I’m trying it now"
5,"The scent was ""phenomenal"" and fit me like  stud.."
5,I receive compliments shells frequently
5,Smells decent and works very well. I’d definitely buy it again and would recommend this to other people.
5,"This product does smell good and it attracts a good vibe. Although it is a little oily and the cap falls off easily, it is still a quality product for the price."
5,Smells good. Works well.
5,"I do like the scent and longevity of this product, I do wish it was available in a bit larger of a size."
5,Great scent. Very masculine scent. Would recommend for the price. It's non-alcoholic which I like as I react badly to alcoholic colognes.
5,"This product works only for men,apply some and add some Dylan blue and be respectful when approaching the ladies and watch what happens.......thanks for some magic @For Him"
5,Love this stuff!!!
5,Smells awesome
5,I absolutely love this scent!!! My new all time favorite!
5,"Haven't had it very long and will update this review after some time. However,  it smells very good and have had compliments in that aspect."
5,Great stuff smells great
5,Works perfect for what I need it for
5,Best cologne out there .Smells super clean and spicy 🥵
5,Really enjoy the smell and look forward to the results
5,I liked it she loved it she couldn’t keep her hands off me
5,Great with cologne. Easy to use with the spray head.
5,"Raw Chemistry ""For Him"" cologne has a nice scent. As the title says, it's pretty interesting. It's almost a bit spicy and warm. Scent is quite long-lasting and is not overwhelming (if applied appropriately). Comes in a neat box. This is also quite affordable as a cologne, if you're just looking for something new or an affordable gift option."
5,I think this product works.  It always gets my girlfriend frisky.
5,I just started trying this product but so far it smells good and girls are more talkative and joking around more
5,"Great product, smells amazing.  It almost has a warm ness to the fragrance that lingers.  I put it on in the morning and could smell it still later that night.  Will buy again."
5,I like the way it smells and my wife sure like when i use it
5,I like the packagingThe fine print directions are too small to read
5,"I love how it smells and for me it lasted longer than it says it does. I have sensitive skin too and it did fine on my skin, which I am happy about. Great product!"
5,"I was curious about this product. Now that I have used it, I know that it was worth the money. I can smell the cologne an hour after I used it and better yet, so can my wife."
5,"It smelled really good, but it does fade out fast so you might want to carry it on you or somewhere in the car so you can re apply it. As for it’s intended effect, it actually works a lot. My friends that are girls that I hold strictly platonic started getting touchy and acting weird. So it actually works."
5,"Have been pleasantly surprised by this product. Definitely noticing an X factor in my relationship with my fiancé (who hates cologne by the way, but can’t keep off me with this) as well as coworkers and my bosses. I’d recommend this for sure, it may be specific to people’s body chemistry, but surprised by how well it’s worked for me beyond what I imagined it could."
5,Worked really well on the very first use
5,Great product. Smells awsome and makes the wife get into the mood really quick.
5,Great smell. Lasts all day. My new favorite. Don't know if its an attractant but my wife loves it . I think personality will do more to attract the opposite sex.
5,This stuff smells great. Women go crazy for it. They'll be getting topless in no time. This is perfect for any man.
5,"As described into products descriptions, its works nice. soft fragrance that last all day."
5,I can't for certain say if this product attracts women but it definitely seems to have a positive effect around them. I wore it today around a potential love interest and she seemed more receptive. We went out to eat and the waitress and her trainee were definitely very flirtatious. Even if it doesn't do the trick it has a nice scent that isn't like the scent of most colognes and isn't overpowering. I will definitely be a repeat customer.
5,Love this product. Smells great!
5,"Just got it yesterday,  so far so good"
5,This product smells very well. When you get heated up from working or playing you can smell it even more. It is subtle but is also a lovely scent. I would recommend this to someone looking for something a little extra.
5,I love this product!
5,"Unique scent, very inviting. Excellent"
5,"It smells amazing. The time it last is shorter thss as n expected. However, still great."
5,I loved it wife goes wild
5,Great smelling product and a good selling price compare to others.
5,Smells amazing. Will definitely buy again when I run out!
5,"So, I wore this to see my long distance girlfriend for the first time in a while. It obviously worked, she hasn't stopped talking about how much she loves it and it's a few weeks after. It also worked in... other ways if you catch my drift"
5,Great so far.
5,"Smells great and doesn't smell cheap, and it's well worth the price."
5,The best cologne that I have so far.
5,"product blends really well with my natural scent! plus i got some free things today, just cause, so that was nice"
5,Great smell hope it works as good as it smellso
5,"Smells good, would buy again"
5,This is my third bottle of this cologne. I love it’s scent!
5,I am eager to try the free set! This cologne smells great at first I was a little nervous because it really is a kind of oil lol but as it sets in it's pretty strong it lasts pretty long it really does smell good compared to my other natural colognes it is somewhat of a fruity smell but it could be because of all the natural essences they're going to come from nature so I suppose but I like it and I'm eager to try the free set!
5,I bought this for my boyfriend and we both love it! Sometimes I want to wear it!
5,8/10 really good for the price
5,I love that smell
5,Smell good
5,"Guys, dont let the price tag sway you, this fragrance is great! Much so for me as i need something that isnt too harsh it might start choking patients out. Very clean, apple scent… refreshing"
5,"Lovely smell, stays on all day unless I start perspirating. Can't beat the price. Very happy overall with this cologne."
5,Love the smell on my man.
5,For what i paid good value
5,Hadn't bought a cologne in a while. Got a few compliments!
5,smells amazing
5,Nice smelling
5,I have never had multiple people come up to me and say that I smelt good out of random nor has anyone asked me what cologne I use because I smell so good. I work in a warm warehouse where I am physically lifting boxes all day and three to four sprays last me the whole day even after getting sweaty and hot. Worth the purchase and I will be using this consistently. Don't be afraid to buy it. It's awesome.
5,AMAZING SCENT! Authentic. Last for about 6 hrs. Projection-2-3 hrs then becomes a skin scent. Great scent for the money. Will buy again.
5,Legit and worthy
5,Last long and smell great!
5,Smell great for less.  Using it everyday.
5,My husband likes this brand and the fresh scent. He loved the value for money as well. Makes a nice gift.

5,My husband loves this gift ! He got plenty of compliments from family members on Father’s Day ! Well worth it !

5,great price smells good just what I was looking for
5,"I bought this for my husband and didn’t know what it smelled like of if we’d like it, but it smells really good, you get a good amount and I bought the smaller one too! And it last for awhile too! Anyways I would definitely buy again and probably will!"
5,It’s not a overwhelming smell. It smells good and the girls seem to like it.

5,It was a nice surprise

5,A very good value!

5,Very nice smell. The longevity on it is okay
5,"Definitely buying this scent again, aquatic, salty, clean, fresh, timless.. great longevity and great value for the money.."
5,"A few sprays on the chest and two on the wrist (skin, not clothes) of this has been my routine for a for five or so years now. It’s in my routine.I have gotten compliments from family, friends, co-workers, and more. It’s so in my routine that I’ve forgotten how good it smells. I’ve just become the “good smelling guy” in the friend group. Not a bad thing when it just seems so natural! Even after five years it’s still proving strong!"
5,One of my favorite smelling cologne. Will buy again.
5,I love everything about the cologne.I have nothing to complain about. I’ve been using it for years.

5,I have received it thank you
5,"After receiving the perfume, I added two shots of it the my work shirt. I can safely say that after returning home from a full 10 hrs manual work day, my wife was able to tell me that I had on a new perfume she never smell before. You literally have to wash your shirt to get it out.  Money well spent :)"
5,"it's a nice clean scent.. people will say.. you smell good.. it's not heavy, it a breeze of cool wind that gentle wafts the senses, making people thing . He smells good as you walk by.. guys will want to hang out with you, because you are the man, women will appreciate the fact you don't stink, like 60% percent of the other guys they walk by.. to be appreciated.. is a good thing.. ask anyone...b"
5,Longevity scent awesome
5,"A pleasant, not overpowering, scent for regular use at a modest price."
5,This is a classic cologne. It has a fresh scent and is very affordable. My woman loves it!
5,"Great for daytime casual wear, but not an Essy Miake"
5,Good quality. Low price
5,My dad loves this. The scent is very nice
5,Love the scent. Not to strong. Smells like just took a shower. Lol.
5,Liked most items
5,"The packaging was great, the smell is wonderful on my husband and the price was affordable."

5,"Was skeptical about this purchase but boy did this exceed our expectations, scent is really nice and lasts long as well definitely value for money , will buy again"
5,"The scent is amazing, it starts with a strong aroma of “I'm not sure” then cools off with almost a cucumber lilac summer scent. Lasts all Day! So surprised by this."
5,Great value Great smell
5,I have $100 bottles and this fragrance contends with them. When I wear this I get as much compliments as the $100+ bottles. This is an amazing fragrance and it's so darn cheap. If you don't want to break the bank but want a fresh clean aquatic summer/spring fragrance look no further!
5,Birthday present for him. He loves the scent so 5 stars.
5,Great budget buy.
5,its ok
5,This cologne is a complement getter. The longevity of this is amazing. I washed my clothes and you still can smell it. If you have sinus issue don't buy these but it's great for the price.
5,I love it 🥰
5,Scents good
5,This is such a great deal compared to purchasing in a brick and mortar store.
5,I like it so it works for me.
5,Literally smells like the ocean if the ocean was sweet. Buy the big bottle.
5,"I took a chance on this because I like a summer beach type fragrance.. Very mild,GF loves it..Longevity is a few hours,which is fine by me..  For the amount and price I can’t complain.. I’m not a cologne snob,I’m not educated in scents.. I took a chance on this,and the GF really likes it..and she’s a scent snob! spends hundreds on perfumes.. maybe I got lucky?"
5,"It's hard to find a good scent that isn't stupid expensive, it's even harder to find a scent from Nautica that isn't completely horrible. Somehow this is actually really high quality/enjoyable and also inexpensive. This has been my go to fragrance for around 4 years now. I highly recommend it."
5,Rally Great
5,This was a gift for my husband and he loves it. Purchased another one for my son-in-law and he went crazy he wanted that cologne and did not have a chance to get it before so he really loved it I'm so glad.
5,Great scent last all day.
5,"Don't know if it's original or not but for the price, you can't beat it. Large size bottle, smells awesome and last long. Always receiving compliments from the ladies, they love it."
5,Great scent! Not heavy but light! Great for demands for physical movements at work!
5,"It smells really good, my son loved it."
5,Good scent
5,"Great value, smells awesome and lasts a long time"
5,Smells great and the scent is kinda strong so u only need to spray it like 2-3 times so it lasts a while
5,Love this fragrance and great price as welll will be buying again
5,"I Tried this out of the blue, (pun intended), and was quite surprised! Am very pleased with this cologne. It is light, airy, fresh, not overpowering.. a good value for the price. I like nautical themed products, & it does seem to be a scent one would wear on a cruise overlooking the ocean; laying on a comfortable chair at the beach, or just everyday when out and about, wishing you were near the ocean. If there’s one thing to critique, it would be nice if the scent lingered longer, but definitely will not step me from buying again!"
5,Smells great. Overall happy with my purchase.
5,Perfect smell
5,I love the smell of this.  While it lasts longer than most colognes I wish it would last even longer.
5,My late husband one and only cologneSmells sooooooo goodIts a light refreshingLawd couldn't get enough of smelling him lol

5,I get compliments every time I wear this cologne
5,I bought at discount... I was so lucky!!!
5,The scent is very lovely its long lasting
5,I was skeptical on buying this for my boyfriend after seeing a few reviews of it having a high school boy scent. I gave it to my boyfriend and he wears it quite often and I love the smell myself. Deff a good purchase/gift
5,My ex used to wear this and I love it! I got it for a Christmas gift and I know he is going to love it too. 🙂
5,Smell's good doesn't last very long value for cost its ok

5,Smells great & you get so much product for a low price! Bought for a guy friend and it smells more expensive than it really is! Great gift or everyday wear!
5,I got this for my dad for his birthday. He said he really loved the scent and my mom said it smelled very familiar and she enjoyed it too.To me the scent reminds me of the Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disney World. It smells like that tropical fruity floral scent when you go in with the big battling tall ships.
5,"Sent lasts , unlike the stuff I have been using ,IT'S OK STUFF ."
5,"This the one, dont even think twice. It smells good and last long."
5,I like the smell and it last more than I thought it would

5,Perfect
5,I get so many compliments on this cologne. It’s a must have
5,Good item

5,very good product thank you
5,very good price.my grandson love it..
5,"It was a very good value for my money, the scent is pleasant and fresh, and it surprisingly lasts for more than 8 hours."
5,Value for money
5,Smells great! Last long.
5,The smell is AMAZING. I LOVE it. Lasts all day long.
5,Very good value for money product from a famous brand.
5,This is my favorite scent Cologne and for a while I couldn’t find it ! So happy to find it on Amazon for a great price
5,Was very surprised with this cologne. I took the risk of not smelling before buying but it was worth the risk. Buy it if your thinking about it it’s worth it
5,Oh my god this cologne is the best I’ve ever had… it literally last all day.. I spayed some in me the day before around 4pm and I still smell it on me the next day 10/10 product
5,Awesome
5,Great scent and good price
5,I bought this for my husband and it smells AMAZING!! It came pretty quick too! He loves it!
5,"It's not Penhaligon's, but you get your money's worth"
5,My son loved it.
5,"Smells really nice - strongest notes that I got were vanilla, and seemed to be the longest lasting of the notes.  Could put two shots on the wrist, rub wrists and neck, and could still smell vanilla 12 hours later.  Scent did not project too far, so wasn't offensive and I didn't leave a cloud behind me, but I could smell it.  The scent is not complex at all, but I enjoy it.  Will be trying other versions of the Cremo cologne as I really enjoy a couple of their body washes (Blue Cedar and Cypress, Sage and Citrus are both very nice)."
5,Don't smell like I imagined but it still smells great
5,"this smells very good. It is a perfect mix of all of the notes, the vanilla isn’t overwhelming. Despite this, it still is a very unisex scent. I am so glad I bought it. Very “alpha” woman-y."
5,"Honestly the scent is really nice, I'd say rustic, and I would say it's close to being a everyday kind of cologne. Lasts all day and the wife loves it"
5,Tell you the truth I did a lot of shopping to find this cologne. I stayed away from the popular name brands of cologne for two reasons 1 fear of receiving a fake designer knock off 2 wearing a fragrance like everyone elseThis Cremo was a perfect choiceI’m pretty sure it will never be a fake designer cologne the price is so good it wouldn’t make sense.The fragrance is totally unique and awesome. Unlike a anything you’ve ever tried  spicy and sweet (vanilla). manly but not over powering women love it.Guys isn’t that the main reason we even wear cologne so we smell nice to women 😂Buy this today you won’t be disappointed
5,"This inexpensive cologne smells as good as the $100.00 fragrance I bought for hubs! Woodsy, manly, not too strong. I purchased on strength of reviews, and was not disappointed. Hubs loves this cologne also."
5,I like that my wife can't keep her hands off me.
5,Smells great love the comments
5,"I am shocked at how good this smells. Especially for the price! I almost bought my husband $100 cologne, but thought I would try this. 100% recommend!"
5,"It’s really just that simple everything that I have purchased from cremo from my first bottle of body wash has been good, the scents are great and very affordable, I shop regularly and get compliments daily. The cologne is great and you don’t need to spray much at all"
5,Great scent for the money
5,"Never been told I smell good so much... Don't buy it, This stuff needs to be kept a secret, we don't want everybody using it.  ..."
5,"I love Viktor & Rolf's Spicebomb, and this gives me that fragrance to wear every day and save my ""real"" deal for special occasions. It tends to last most of my work day and at the price point you can't really deny how good of a deal it is. Definitely looking forward to trying their other scents!"
5,"Very nice aroma , not longest lasting, but for the price it is very nice."
5,"I love the scent...smells natural, of wood and musk, pe"
5,"Not what i was expecting... Definitely not a well rounded manly scent...Highly musky, very floral...i didn't like... wife didn't like amd my kids said i smelled like a goat lol soo... that's a no go..HOWEVER, THE  SPICE & BLACK VANILLA (whatever) IS AMAZING!And a great value for money... many compliments,  by women, wife included from that one."
5,It smells nice without being feminine or overwhelming
5,It is just Wonderful !
5,Smells great last long great value
5,this cologne smells amazing and is so worth the money. great value
5,The smell is absolutely amazing. Super appealing and receive tons of compliments when wearing it. Worth every penny.
5,It's a good value buy
5,"I've been trying to buy this scent forever. They finally had it in stock and i  jumped on it. The scent on this cologne is amazing. It starts off a little spicy and woodsy. Than you smell a little deeper and you he tell the warm vanilla in your face. Thus scent lasts all day and the smell just gets better. If you love vanilla and spice, this is the cologne for you"
5,Smells great!!!
5,"I hope they never discontinue this stuff. I've been looking for the perfect cologne for my main man for a long time. This scent is beautiful, masculine, and SEXY.  I bury my face into his chest whenever he wears it.  He also loves it.  It lasts all day.  It's affordable.  It's not poison.  What can I say but BUY IT!"
5,Captivating! Spicy scent with warm under notes of vanilla.
5,It’s smells amazing! And my husband loves it
5,"This smell is fantastic, lasts a long time, and is a definite winner. The vanilla is strong, but not overpowering. It also takes on a different personality after a few hours which is not a bad thing. Lasts about 4 hours before you have to give a touch up spray though."
5,Reviews were on point. This is a very nice fragrance. Can be a bit overwhelming!! Just a dab will do!!!
5,Women go crazy over this cologne!!! And it smells awesome lasting for at least 8 hours!!!
5,Fantastic sent great bang for your buck do not hesitate by at 110% you will be happy.
5,This scent is pretty heavy and would be best suited for cooler seasons. Nice smell and long lasting. Good value for the money.
5,I love the scent...I'm a forklift operator and I don't like wearing my good stuff to work so this is my next best option and all my homies be like say og what's that
5,"This is a great scent, not over powering.  I've seen a lot of reviews complaining about it not lasting all day.  EU de toilette cologne lasts about 4 hours,  this is what I expected.  If you want all day applications,  spend the extra on eu de parfum.  This cologne gets attention in the way you want it to."
5,Great masculine smell that lasts a long time. Definitely worth buying especially for the price
5,"Oak and Bourbon is a great combination for a man's cologne, very earthy."
5,Doesn't break the bank and smells awesome lasts me all day. Everyone always give compliments on it all the time.
5,Love the pleasant smell.
5,Smells great and scents last s very long time! 👍👍
5,"I love how it smells, it absolutely smells like vanilla and spices. This is the first scent I’ve ever gotten online, and I’d definitely buy again!"
5,Smells amazing...very masculine but sweet scent.
5,Love the scent!! Speedy delivery! Thank You!👍👍👍👍
5,It smells absolutely amazing! My husband LOVES it. He is SO picky when it comes to his cologne. I haven’t been able to find him one he likes since Avon discontinued his. But this one smells exactly like it.
5,I really like the smell. I get a lot of compliments on it
5,"Smells Good, Good Value"
5,I love the smell and aroma of the spray. You have to enough to really get that long lasting scent. I work with a lot of women and when I walk into a room it’s like WOW! When I leave a room they know I was there but not in an over powering way. Awesome fragrance as well as the other scents.
5,"My new favorite cologne, my wife loves it!!!It smells like an expensive masculine cologne. I will be ordering more in the future."
5,Loving It
5,I was blown away! I'm particularly picky when it comes to buying husbands cologne. OMG! Off the charts FABULOUS FANTASTIC.  It's what all other reviewers say! If these notes of men's cologne intrigue you! ...buy! Husband LOVED it win win for Us! Buy buy!
5,Love this cologne! Great smell. Last along time and a great cost.
5,"I've used other Cremo products and have always been satisfied with the quality.  This cologne is no exception.  it smells wonderful, masculine and woodsy and just a couple sprays and it lasts a good long while.  I sprayed a shirt and then two days later the shirt still had that smell to it.  great stuff, couldn't say enough good things about it and would definitely recommend.  also recommend the accompanying body wash, it's equally awesome.  100% buying again"
5,My wife loved it. Long lasting. Not perfumy but manly.
5,"Smells amazing, a little bit goes a long way, but the scent stays for a while. Would definitely purchase again!"
5,Love the smell and get ole ty of compliments
5,"I honestly didn't know what to expect when I bought this product, but after the first spray I knew I made a good purchase. I wished the smell lasted longer than it does and maybe then I wouldn't have to keep smelling myself to make sure the fragrance was still noticeable. I plan on purchasing a different fragrance in the near future to compare."
5,Well worth the price! Lasts long and smells great!
5,"Very pleased with the scent ,well worth the money . Would definitely recommend this product if your looking for a woody masculine smell"
5,"Yo! I've bought and have so many different colognes. My aunt has been a cologne sales person since I can remember so any just about any fragrance you could think of, I probably have it or had it at one point or another and some very expensive.  This $25 bottle of cologne has immediately become my favorite. The smell is very manly yet not overpowering. Every time I move I get a slight wiff of that bourbon oak smell.  One of my favorite colognes is Terre DeHermes which cost well over $100 and this cologne smells better to me. This will easily be my go to fragrance."
5,Love it!
5,Love they products
5,Very nice sent. My wife loves it.
5,ME really like it
5,Simply I love it
5,"Smells great and last long, what more do you want for the price"
5,I love the aroma which is a desirable scent.
5,Great love the scent fast service
5,"Basically Spice Bomb. Literally super close to the real thing for a fraction of the price! Highly recommend this. Lasts almost all day, performs well, compliments left and right. Worth every penny. I buy designer fragrances for 100$+ and this is one of my favorites in comparison actually. Great daily scent. Best used in the fall or winter. If used in the hot summer, I would use it only if you’re staying indoors. 100% buy this."
5,I loved the smell and the size of this… it will last a long time and the scent lasts a long time! So happy I bought it!
5,Amazing juice same like spicebomb extreme
5,Scent lasts all day long. Has a sweet smell that could be worn by either sex. I'll definitely order again but try a different scent in hopes of finding something slightly more masculine.
5,"my neighbor wears this and after asking them again what the scent is, i finally bought some! i love this scent!my only critique is it doesn’t have longevity worth the scent. you need to reapply often"
5,Wow this cologne smells and lasts like a cologne that costs 60-80 dollars. I get plenty of complemts and it lasts long
5,Really happy about the purchase
5,It’s a great smell. I feel like it doesn’t last very long but it’s does smell great.
5,Doesn't smell exactly like body wash or beard products but still a great smell that lasts all day.
5,Tickle the nose alittle but once it calms down it’s really nice and light if you don’t spray too much ! Not bad ! Good product ! Great scent ! Very masculine with a soft touch !
5,"Scent is a nice oaky spice, great value smells like cologne 3 times the price. I really like it and my wife thought it smells good too."
5,This smells AMAZING. I get compliments each and every time I wear it. I def recommend.
5,"The initial scent is more bourbon, but the dry down is more depth of the oak barrel. Very manly and sophisticated. The longevity could be a little better, but for the price, it's a nice bottle to keep in the collection. Probably a better winter profile than summer."
5,Very large bottle! Smells really good.  Different from anything else I've smelt.
5,Good product fast shipping thanks 😊
5,I love this smell! It’s fresh smelling just like their shampoo!
5,I wasn’t sure about this scent. But for the money it’s a good purchase. I’ve received many compliments
5,"Was always a Paul Sebastian fan. This is even better. Wonderful, long lasting scent. It's high swoon."
5,Perfect Scent for the summer!
5,Smells nice and lasts long
5,Smells good. The wife loves it!
5,Bought this for my son. He loves it.
5,I want to start with I enjoy the body wash with this scent. It is a bit stronger and harder on the nose for the first 15 minutes and I would recommend spraying in an open area. I.E don’t jump right in your car afterwards or you may need to drive with the windows down for a while. Again it’s not bad and if you know what the smell is like then your getting just that. It’s just starts off very strong and then it becomes smoother.
5,Smells really good. Vanilla musky.
5,I absolutely love the scent of this cologne and others have even complimented me on the smell of it in public.  It's difficult to describe the smell but somone who is a little more  mature and not into axe body spray will love this cologne. The best I can explain with the smell is it has a pleasant scent of vanilla to it that last for a long time. (All my opinion)
5,"Long lasting, nice scent without an exorbitant price.  Great value for the money."
5,It’s actually smells pretty good I was surprised with it . Is it the Best smelling stuff and last forever ? No . But it does smell good and it is cheap .
5,"Not much to say here. This stuff smells great and is as nice combination between botanical and musk. It’s a nice, clean, masculine scent.Just buy it, already. One bottle should last two years."
5,"A dab on my wrists, and a touch behind the ears and I was in love with this cologne, so was my wife, my daughter and her friend, two female customers, the bank teller, the gas station attendant then 9 hours later my neighbor complimented me on how ""enticing"" I smell! Now it has been 12 hours and I still smell wonderful. I will definitely be buying this again and again!"
5,Very unique fragrance. Had several compliments. Great price
5,Great product.
5,Scent is just what I was looking for! Smells more expensive that what it costs so the value was great! Can't rate longevity because I just received it. Will buy again soon!
5,Love the scent
5,A very good product....recommended
5,Great scent. Asked numerous times by women what it was and told them where to buy for their men and now its almost impossible to get.
5,Good Manley smell lasts all day long.
5,The scent is absolutely amazing!
5,"Pretty nice, clean scent, not super strong, and not actually very cologne-y.  Good stuff, could last a bit longer, though..."
5,"Smells just like spicebomb extreme, maybe not the same longevity but at this price you just put on a few more sprays so who cares. My wife loves this on me. Definitely a compliment getter..."
5,Great scent. Great price. Premium aroma. It does transform towards the end of the initial scent and you kind of smell like a bread pudding. Quite spicey at first and then smooth warm vanilla at the end. I like it and people tend not to make faces and ive gotten compliments already. Similar to a True Religion cologne i had.
5,"The cologne I was using doubled in price. I tried this for about 1/4 the price. I liked it so much I just sent off for more before it too goes up. It last several hours, and smells great."
5,I love the Cremo fragrances that I purchased so far. I wish it got more cred in the YouTube videos. I do keep on telling folks in their comment sections how good Cremo is.
5,I get a ton of compliments when I wear this
5,Hands down best company of cologne
5,I just love this porfume! Last long! It’s my second purchase!I noticed that it change a lot with different skin!
5,This cologne is terrific and the price is right it starts out strong but then it mellows out to smell fantastic at first it reminded me of cream soda and after about 5 minutes WoW and it lasts all day but not overwhelming very pleasant to to nose.
5,Amazing my only regret is I didn't buy 2-3 more honestly . I love it
5,Just as advertised and fast free Prime shipping. I will be back for other scents. Great smelling per my wife. My new favorite. Thanks for a great Amazon experience.
5,I had to immediately write a review for this AMAZING COLOGNE!!!This inexpensive Men’s Cologne smells so good and lasts all day!I bought this for a inexpensive cologne to wear to work and around the house after a shower.The Bourbon & Oak scent is amazing and smells almost identical to several very expensive name brand colognes!I’ll never buy another expensive name brand cologne again! I hope Cremo never discontinue this awesome cologne!!!I just bought a second bottle of a different flavor!!!
5,I bought this for my husband because he already had the bodywash and it smells amazing. This is a great smelling cologne for the money.
5,"This product definitely exceeded my expectation, will definitely buy again..."
5,Looove this scent on my bf. Smells amazing.
5,Very nice item...I would buy it AGAIN !!
5,"Wife loves it, get lots of compliments and flirty exchanges when wear it. For the money a no brained buy try it, nothing to lose so much to gain."
5,Smells great and last long just with a test spray it lasted me 6+ hours
5,"Love this scent, lasts all day while I work with clients and is a very masculine scent. Very appealing to say the least."
5,Perfect scent and lasts all day!
5,A great smelling colone that lasts. I have bought more expensive colone that didn't smell as good or have the scent longevity
5,Bought this for my husband because he uses the Cremo Shaving Cream all the time and loves it. I was hoping he would like the scent and thankfully he loved it. Needless to say I will definitely be purchasing this again when he needs another bottle.
5,"I generally love Cremo products, but this is a complete “miss”. It smells great, but is completely gone in 30 mins. So disappointed. Their other scents for men last way longer and smell really great. Stupidly, I bought two and now have to hassle with a return.  Stick with Cremo, but another scent."
5,"This is a strong fragrance lasts all day and smells wonderful, does indeed give you that spice bomb vybe.. Warning it isn't for hot days it will over power you and go light on the sprays it's strong!"
5,I love it
5,Easy to use and very convenient ! I like !
5,Love the fact it’s two in one. Much easier than having to use a brush and dryer.
5,Quick drying and styling. Love it!
5,"I own 2 Of these dryers. One for my home and the other for traveling. Yes, it’s a large size, but still very manageable to use."
5,Works great!!
5,I usually let my hair dry a little before blow drying to lesson heat time but I love this thing it's amazing and easy to use my hair is beach curls very lose texture and it does a great job it worked on my nieces thicker hair just as well
5,Works better than expected!! Excellent product
5,A great gift.  Dries and smooths hair so well.
5,I saw this product on a you tube review. It worked amazing. So i bought it and they were right. It works great! I love it and would highly recommend if your looking for this type of hair dryer.
5,"It’s a bit heave but it works great. Makes hair shinny like salon and my hair dries quickly. I blow dry with reg blow dryer first until my fair isn’t super wet, then use this fabulous blow dryer.I was worried my hair might get tangled  but it doesn’t.  My hair is below shoulders but haven’t had a problem yet."
5,Great for quick dry and excellent shine
5,I was hesitant to buy this product but I finally broke down and purchased it. I am glad I did because I love it and it’s the only way I dry my hair now. It is very easy to use and drys my hair fairly quick. It leaves my hair smooth and soft. Love it!!
5,"I don’t do my hair often but with this is so much faster, so far it hasn’t broken like I read in some reviews so crossing fingers it will last a while!"
5,My hair it's super long and and I day it super fast with this and give me a nice volume
5,"I love this!  It was recommended to replace another styling brush that died.  It works great.  You really don't need another dryer as this can do double duty.  The styling side is so easy and gives lasting curls.  My only complaint is that it's a tad large for my small hands.  If you have thin hair, I recommend using the low setting as the high is quite hot and powerful, which is great for thick hair."
5,This product has excellent drying power and it is easy to use.  The price of this item is hard to beat. If you have a coupon your an buy it for $35.00
5,Dries quickly and so easy. I was worried I wouldn’t have the mechanics to do it but it’s so natural. Get it!
5,Amazing literally cut my time in half
5,I have owned this for little over one year and don’t use it every day and the motor has already burned out. Hopefully I can get it replaced.
5,Love love love this roller brush hair dryer. Easy to use and adds body to your hair
5,Dryer that you won't regret to get!
5,Love this product!  It is so easy to add volume and get a pro blowout at home.  Straightens and smooths hair quickly!  Works great for my medium length hair and my daughter's extra long hair.
5,"This dryer works better than any I’ve used in the past. My hair is wavy so when I want it straighter and styled well I use the Revlon one-step dryer, and my hair looks silky and shinier than ever. I’ve not been able to achieve those results before."
5,"I was totally influenced on Instagram to buy this, and actually I’m really happy that I did. It’s easy to use and cuts down time I spend on my hair. Got one for my mom and MIL, and they both use it daily. Totally worth it."
5,Absolutely love how easy and amazing this works!
5,"No more taking an hour to straighten all this hair! It takes too long to do w a straight iron so for this price, it’s a great product. Throw it in the gym bag and use it at the gym and voila, hair done in minutes. Where had this been my whole life?"
5,Makes Curley hair straight.
5,After trying so many blow dryers finally I found the right one to straight my frizzy curly hair. I got the blue one for curly hair. My damp shoulder lenght frizzy curly hair was straight in about 15 minutes.
5,"Now I can brush, straighten and go.  I needed this a long time ago and best of all fits in my drawer •••••Love my hair makes it so soft"
5,I almost cancelled the order because of some reviews here but I’m glad I ended up going through with the purchase! They have added a low setting which works perfectly for me and it’s so convenient to use!
5,I’m picky in anything I buy for my hair as is long and thick was in search for something to help me dry it faster and stumbled on this one not only does it dry it but also straighten it not much as my hair is thick for does with thin hair this would be heave but got me it does enough that when I use my straightener it has cut my tone from 3hrs to about 1 1/2 it’s a huge difference so do recommend this whole heartedly
5,Easiest way to straighten my curly hair !Close to a professional blow out
5,"This is very simple to use.  A little loud however, it dries my thick hair well & helps me to style it better.  I usually keep my hair straight so now I hardly ever use my flat iron.  This gives you that blow out look."
5,"As someone who can’t blow out my hair the traditional way, this product gives me that same look and it’s so easy to use!!! Leaves my hair sleek, shiny, and with volume!"
5,The ease of it.  For short or long  hair
5,"It’s so easy to work, just don’t use it on highest heat you will get burn. It’s already very hot in low. I haven’t got burn but I did read the reviews and watch YouTube… but it’s a most amd great for the price"
5,"First let me preface that I have only used this product for ~10 minutes and have already decided that I love it. I have thick and curly/wavy hair. I would definitely describe my hair as a bit of a hassle to deal with, so I seldom do deal with it. I am 21-years-old and can probably count on one hand how many times I have tried to blow dry my hair in my life. And I have never been successful. Anyways I made a pact to commit to being a hot girl this year and I think this brush will be the secret to my success? It was humorously easy to use (take it from the girl who literally does not know how to regularly blow dry) and my hair was ready in less than 10 minutes. I have A LOT of hair too. Also, there's no frizz!!! I put in some product before blowdrying but still my hair usually frizzes. I feel like I just got a blow out and my confidence is through the roof.Also, I know some reviews said it got too hot so I was kind of nervous about this. However, I had it on high the whole time and felt that it was cooler than when I get a blowout at the salon. At one point while using this, the brush slipped off my countertop and in a panic I grabbed it by the bristles and was totally fine."
5,Dont buy fake products with no names saying their hair dryer is good my wife got one and literally light up on fire revlon is the real deal never had any issues.
5,I have very fine hair and this tool dries my hair very quickly.  I wish it had more than just a high and low setting for heat.
5,"Like how it works, just wish the barrel was a little smaller since I have short hair.  Also not very many settings so it seems really hot or cool. With a little practice you can get your hair to come out the way you want."
5,"Easy to use for drying, styling or touching up the next day."
5,This is fast and easy to use and saves me from having to flat iron my hair. I feel the trick is to let your hair dry naturally until it’s barely damp. The air can get pretty hot so be careful. It’s a little noisy but not as loud as described on other reviews. Very satisfied with this purchased and not sure the more expensive brands would warrant the extra cost. Thanks.
5,Best brush dryer ever. Super easy to use!
5,Love this I have thick hair bought my daughter one too
5,Easy to use! Blow drying my hair made it frizzy and fly away. This product leaves my hair silky smooth.
5,It pretty useful and good quality
5,I love having a hairdryer and brush in one tool. This makes my hair straight and shiny without additional product. I LOVE this so much and would definitely take this on vacation with me and pack fewer clothes just so I don't have to use the hairdryers that are provided in hotels.
5,"I have tried and failed several times doing a blowout at home using the ol' metal roundbrush and blow dryer w/nozzle combo (even after several youtube tutorials).  Using that method, the coordination was tough because I couldn't get the nozzle angle consistent to make my hair go in the direction I want while also twirling the round brush at the perfect angle and not tangling my hair.  It always turns out a frizzy mess with tangles, pulling, and damage to my hair.  I wanted to try this product because it seemed like it would require less coordination, and it did not let me down!  I used a moisturizing balm beforehand and after my first attempt I was extremely happy with this blowout tool!  I found it very easy to navigate the brush through my hair - which is a challenge for long-haired people like myself.  The bristles are kind and my hair did not tangle.  After only a few minutes of use, my (fine, color treated, long) hair had volume and shine, absolutely no frizz.  It's by far the best result I've gotten outside of the salon, a total game changer.  It has changed my look from frizzy natural curls to smooth, silky, shiny, voluminous, and bouncy waves.  Super Super happy with this product I definitely recommend it!"
5,I love this product. Really easy to use and your hair looks beautiful.
5,Cut drying time in half! Love this product. A little loud at first but got used to it.
5,"I’m one of those people who usually only write reviews when a product sucks so that I can save people frustration and money. But this is not the case with this product. Im not kidding when I tell you this is the best styling product I’ve ever owned...and I’ve owned a lot from the cheapest to the most expensive. This tool makes my hair voluminous, smooth and straight. It also cuts down my styling time by half. I no longer have to blow dry and then flat iron - I can skip the flat iron all together now! My only complaint is that you can’t control the heat and it gets VERY hot. But overall, you can’t go wrong with this tool.FYI- I have fine wavy blonde hair that is mid-back in length"
5,I bought this to ease my arm pain of drying with a brush. It doesn’t exactly get the same blowout but it’s much much easier and quicker
5,"I don't know what I did before I had this in my life! I love it so much, I also got one for my mom. Works great on wet hair and dry hair."
5,Lessens dry time and gives awesome volume
5,"I have had this item sitting in my wish list for probably 2-3 years, I just kept talking myself out of it. Finally a tiktoker made a video using and reviewing it and it officially sold me on making the purchase.  I was very overall impressed with the dryer. My hair is past my bra line in length and has a natural wave to it.  This dryer left it looking straight but with texture and volume still left. My curiosity with the product was mainly because I love a blown out look however I’ve never been able to accomplish the skill it takes to maneuver and work the hair that way with a dryer and a roll brush.  This truly helped!!"
5,Wish it had like a few heat settings it’s just high or low no in between for people with fine hair .. but does the job
5,Best thing invented
5,I have crazy long hair and it takes forever for me to properly dry it. This helps me dry and straighten my hair in no time and is super simple to use.
5,I have a long hair but I don't have the skill nor the time to dry my hair myself but  this dryer brush made it so easy for me. It only took me 20 mintues to dry my hair when I used for the first time. 100% recommended!
5,"It is a good product, but I must recommend that you evaluate first the results that you’re expecting and the type of hair you have. Overall, it is easy to handle."
5,Amazing product
5,I was skeptical when someone recommended this to me but finally purchased it for my daughter. She loved it so much I had to try it and now I am hooked as well. My hair was so soft and not “fried and frizzy” after using this.
5,Fast and easy!!
5,I love this dryer.  It makes blowdrying my hair so easy and quickly.Love the fact that the temperature settings it had doesn't let you burn your scalp if you get too close.Leaves my hair super shinny and just so silky as well.If your looking for a blow dryer that is easy to use and for a great price this is the one to get.
5,"This is a great purchase, and a really good price. Works well would recommend."
5,I really like how quickly this dries my hair and I don’t need to use a flat iron.  I do wish there was another setting for temp control
5,It can get very hot so careful. Easy to use and drys hair fast. I do have think hair. Looks fully when I use this to dry hair.
5,"Absolutely love this little tool! I’ve always sucked at styling my hair never could figure out the whole round brush and hair dryer thing that well. This is the perfect solution! Gives a pretty great blow out look, except at home! Just be sure to let your hair dry a little or blow dry until semi dry and then finish off with this round brush dryer and your hair will be *chef’s kiss*"
5,This is the best one I've ever bought.
5,Easy and the results are amazing
5,"I really like this dryer. I usually just air dry my hair a little before I use this. It straightens my very curly hair in just a couple passes. The only ""con"" is that I wish it had one step lower on the heat."
5,Best hair dryer and volumizer ever! Dries hair fast and gives a style as your hair is drying
5,"I let my hair air dry a bit first, then use this. It smooths, drys and makes a slight curl up on the ends just like I like it! Very easy and fast to use."
5,Not one to really style my hair but I got curtain bangs and now I have to do something with it. I look like I just got my hair professionally blown out after using this and it dries my hair really quickly. IN LOVE!
5,"I am a retired hairdresser and got this on a whim. I have cut my styling time by half and my hair feels much healthier. It’s easy to use, light weight and smooths my hair out perfectly. I would tell people to use this regularly and you’ll learn to use it quickly. It does take a couple of times getting used to it but I love it. Hope you do too!"
5,"Does an excellant job, would recommend to anyone."
5,I love this hairstyling tool!  It is so convenient to have the brush and the blow dryer in one.  It leaves my hair soft and shiny.  Well worth the purchase!
5,this is awesome. make your hair super shiny and smooth easy to use/.
5,"The product is excellent! It saving my time , specifically on combing my nice hear every morning!"
5,"Love the temperature control. Is heavier than I thought, but is not bad at all. Take me around 15min to dry and straight my hair.  And leave my hair with some volume.  Love it."
5,This product is so easy to use
5,Love this. My hair is very curly and takes about an hour to fully straighten. I now can dry and straighten my hair in maybe less than 20 minutes. I only have to touch up a few pieces when I’m finished. Makes getting ready so fast. I get good volume too.
5,"I am a very lazy person. I rarely do my hair, but this is so easy to use and it doesn't take a lot of my time or effort. I get compliments and  I love it"
5,"Shaves so much time off getting ready. Drys my hair fast and it look good not frizzy, I have replaced  my flat iron with this."
5,"You really need to have your hair a little damp for this dryer to work. If you try to do it straight out of the shower, it will take FOREVER. It is definitely not a replacement for a brush but I will tell you I have not picked up my hair dryer since I got this thing. Very handy for traveling too! Try it out. See for yourself"
5,This blow dryer works great with my long hair! Easy to use and control.
5,"This is the easiest brush dryer to use, I will not go back to regular dryer!"
5,It’s easy to use and totally love the volume it gives my hair.
5,I am disabled and have trouble with normal dryers. This makes my life so much easier.
5,This is the best hair dryer I’ve ever bought. Going to donate my old hair dryer right now. The product is a bit larger than I had expected but my hair looks amazing!
5,"I LOVE this hairdryer! For the price, it works even better than expected. I have extremely thick hair and this dries my hair faster than a normal blow dryer. It is so easy to use and saves so much time and effort. By far the best thing I’ve purchased in a while!"
5,"I have extremely thick hair, and it usually takes me forever to blow dry, and it always ends up super frizzy and puffy after.  Not to mention I can't usually use a round brush in it without it getting stuck. My sister let me borrow hers when we were getting ready and I fell in love. It was sooo easy on my hair and my hair was so soft and I had no issues getting it through my hair. This this is such a life saver. After one use of my sister's I went and bought my own!"
5,I have stayed away from these tools because they do not have enough heat or drying power for thick hair. I am impressed so far with this tool- I can towel dry and then use or I will use hair dryer first and finish with this on damp hair. Great results!
5,"I wish I had found this sooner. It blows my hair out beautifully, goodbye frizz. I get so many compliments on my hair. I don't have to use a flat iron now. I can even touch up with it the next day. The only problem I have had is the switch is on the base of the handle. Sometimes I accidentally turn it off but hey easy to turn right back on."
5,"I have incredibly thick, curly hair and had resigned myself to being a frizzy mess without at least 2 hours of styling. This this little baby gave me a blowout in 20 minutes.I actually like my hair again, thanks to this product!"
5,Drys hair quickly. Better for medium to long hair. I’ve used different ones. The only thing is this one gets hotter than most
5,"My hair is too curly and frizzy to easily wear straight, and too straight to easily wear curly. But I’ve discovered that this dryer, used with  ColorWow Dream Coat, dried in sections, gives me smooth hair that lasts through the day. It stop roses me that it works better, and is easier, than my expensive dryer and large, round smoothing brushP Bonus that it’s an inexpensive dryer!"
5,Must not be really reckon because it’s junk and doesn’t  even get hot. Don’t waste your money. I want a refund
5,I love this drying brush and wish I found it sooner! I have thick curly hair and this brush dries and styles my hair in a fraction of the time it took me with a brush and hand held hair dryer!
5,Our whole family loves it. Great product and does the job well
5,I had a similar one already but didn't like that the n brush kept separating from the handle. I bought this to replace it. This one leaves my hair softer and more voluminous! I love it!
5,This dryer is amazing! It’s so easy to use! I have long hair and it takes me 10-15 minutes to dry my hair with this dryer! My hair is naturally curly and with volume. When I heard about this product I was a little bit skeptical but I’m glad I bought it anyways! Even my 5 years old daughter likes it (I use it when I wash her hair at night)! This dryer was my Best Buy of this year for sure!
5,Great for the value . Powerful and easy to use
5,I had been waiting to buy this and it really is great for drying styling and taking out frizz...
5,Even on mornings when I don’t think I have time for a blow dry I can get blowout quality hair in less than 10 min. This thing is worth every penny.*I have straight hair that doesn’t not have any curl to it.
5,Very nice product. Isn’t heavy and it’s easy to use. Helps with frizz for my hair. Good price.
5,Easy to use. Able to dry and style at the same time.
5,"I love this hair dryer. I have curly frizzy hair and this dryer not only cuts styling time significantly, it  smoothes out my hair better than a flat iron because it leaves volume, especially on top. This newer model has high airflow at a lower heat setting in addition to the really hot setting. A fantastic improvement. It's definitely worth upgrading from the older model."
5,This dryer dried my hair more quickly and is easy used as a styler between shampoos.
5,"I’ve been looking at getting one of these but was unsure. I do not spend time fixing my hair, I don’t even own a flat iron. But this dryer works great. Better than a brush and a dryer. My hair is smooth and looks great with little effort."
5,My friend recommended it and I love it.It's easy to use and dries my hair really fast
5,I thank good for this product it changed my life my hair is smooth and healthy and it’s so easy
5,"This dryer brush is amazing. It cut my styling time in half and my hair looks great! So much volume and it's so smooth and shiny. Buy this dryer, you won't be disappointed."
5,"I literally could cry right now, my entire life I’ve never been able to properly blow dry my hair given it’s texture & thickness. This product not only blow dryes my hair but also makes it straight getting to my roots!!!!! Amazing buy this ASAP"
5,I like it
5,Easy to use and thick hair dries fast! No need to use a straightener with this: blows hair dry and straight all at the same time. The “hot” setting does get HOT. Would need to supervise youngsters.
5,This actually works. Dries hair and straightens in one step. You can also add volume and lift. Makes hair shiny and causes less damage than having to use multiple tools. One stop tool! Love it. Thanks Revlon and Amazon!
5,Very helpful
5,I was stunned at how smooth and shiny my almost-shoulder-length hair was with using this tool to dry and turn under the ends of my hair in about 5-7 minutes. Never been able to give myself a really good blowout with hair dryer and separate rounded brush. So glad I found this!
5,Bought this for my 12 yr old doing her hair without assistance/ guidance. Easy for her to do herself ( she does have long hair. She has no complaints ( except on the big side) ( that’s why I bought it- easier not to get hair tangled)
5,"This is easy to use, I liked how it grabs hair and keeps it in place. Mine smelled a bit funny, like burned plastic, so I’m getting another one just in case. Seems to be doing what it says and comparable with higher end similar brush/dryers."
5,I love this…style time down to 4 minutes with a smooth finish. My hair actually is softer and looks healthier after styling. I love it!!
5,"After seeing this on every “must have” list out there, I decided I had to have it. It’s as good as they say. Gives me a salon quality blowout in minutes. It is pretty loud on the high setting but I have fine hair so the low setting is usually sufficient if I let my hair dry enough first."
5,"To all my girlfriends out there, this is a miracle in the making.  When I tell you that this combo blow dryer/straightener/curling iron cut my ""hair"" appt with myself down from a full hour to 20 minutes, and the effect was so noticeably different, I truly could not believe it.  You simply must try it, and the price was spot on.  And, no, I did not get paid for this review.  Just thrilled!"
5,Wish I had purchased one of these sooner. Cuts dry time tremendously and styles nice without having to use two tools.
5,I like the fact that this smooths and styles while it dries.  I always used a regular hair dryer and a round brush on my hair.  Now I partially dry my hair with just a regular dryer (no brush) and then use this to add volume.  While it does a very nice job the one item to note is that it’s a bit heavy and my arm gets tired using it.  The other thing is that the brush portion is NOT round on the one that I received - it’s oval.  Don’t know if that makes a difference but this tool works for me.
5,"For the price, this is a great dryer brush. It is the largest size available from Revlon and the air flow is very good. Build quality is exceptionally good. It’s a bit loud (airplane taking off) but the results make up for it.  Highly recommended."
5,Easy to use and perfect results
5,"This is a great hair tool!  It can be used as dryer, straightener and helps give more volume."
5,I absolutely love drying my hair now. It used to take me about 15-20 minutes just because I don’t have the arm muscle to do the constant turning motion with a round brush. This does it for you. It takes me five minutes now and my hair has so much more volume and bounciness. I am so happy I made the purchase.
5,I love this tool. Makes drying my hair go by so fast now! I love the body it gives with very little effort!I will add that the tip gets hot so be careful with the heat on your finger!
5,"My hair can be a little curly and sometimes frizzy, and this dryer makes it smooth with a little curve at the end as I like it. I recommend this hair dryer."
5,"It dries hair quickly, light weight and easy to use"
5,This is easy to use. I get a lot of volume and smoothness from using this.Heats up quick.  Be sure to use a heat protector on your hair!
5,"This is the best thing ever. I was struggling with super frizzy hair after hair drying and it also took my forever to dry my hair (since my hair is thick) and use a brush to try a new get that bouncy look, but it never looked right. I decided I might as well try this product and oh my gosh I’m so glad I did. It takes me half the time to dry my hair and I’m left with it glossy and exactly how I want it! 10/10 recommend this hair brush!!!!"
5,Easy to use
5,"My hairdresser recommended this.  I love it.  Very easy to use and can style hair while drying,  which saves a lot of time.  I would have liked for a couple more heat settings.  Takes longer to dry because there are only 2 heat settings."
5,Love this. Have unruly curl/wavy hair.  Use to blow dry and straighten.  This does it all in one!
5,Bought it for my daughter and she loves it. She said that it is easy to use and it does not leave her hair fizzy.
5,I have curly hair and this cuts my getting ready time in half at least. Wish I would have found this years ago
5,"I love this hot air brush!!  Wow, its awesome!  While I put on my make-up, I air dry my hair and then use a hair dryer for a minute or two to dry it some more because its thick.  I then put it in sections and begin using this amazing brush.....when I'm done with all my hair, it looks wonderful, full and all my frizzies are gone! I highly recommend this!"
5,Mi wife is the happiest with this product
5,"I have curly C4 type hair and this gets it straight! I use a deep conditioner and only a small amount of leave in conditioner. I finish the look with a flat iron only because I prefer my hair pin straight. This beats going to the hair salon and sitting under the bonnet for 1.5 hours, hand held blow drying for 30mins and flat ironing for 30mins (yes 2 hrs minimum if I am the person on the chair) for $35 - $45. Now I blow dry my hair for free at home under 40 minutes. Best invest I have ever purchased."
5,I love this product for my uncontrollable thick hair. It now takes me 10-15 minutes to dry instead of 30-40 minutes.
5,Bought to straighten my curly hair. Works great!
5,Perfect blowout in 20 min or less. Only three options for temperature. But very high heat and great drying power. My only complaint is it is very loud but makes up with it’s effectiveness.
5,This was so easy to use and my hair was done in 15 minutes!
5,I absolutely love this blow dryer!! It makes my hair so smooth.  It does get really hot and the only thing I wish is it had another setting between the hot and the low.
5,This was the best spent money. I have super fine thin hair and with this tool it takes me no time to dry it!
5,Worth the money
5,Thank you muy agradecido
5,Fabulous product… I never have to get a blow dry again. It takes five minutes to have beautiful looking hair! Love love love it
5,Very very Good
5,"I saw this gadget when a younger lady was drying her hair in the women's locker room.  I actually bought 2 of these now, one for my gym bag, and the other for home.  It gets my hair dry and well blow dried in minutes, is easy to keep clean light and affordable.  Dyson makes a similar product that is $300.  Wow that would be such a ripoff since this does the trick."
5,"I have frizzy, curly long hair. I usually just wear it natural because I'm a single mom and the traditional two-step blow dry and straighten process takes forever. This thing cut that process down to 15 minutes flat. It tames the frizz well! Highly recommend for long, thick, curly hair."
5,"Amazing hair dryer for thick, curly hair! This will save you so much time and sweat!"
5,"This thing is awesome!!! I’m not much for styling my hair a ton, I use products on my fine hair for an extra boost then blow dry. Using this brush/blower really boosts the body in my hair and gives it bounce. It’s so much fun I tossed my blow dryer out! You need this!!! Has a cool setting as well as a speed setting."
5,It’s the easier most convenient product
5,I bought this for my mom and she loves it.
5,Super easy use.
5,I don’t use a hair dryer but my wife loves this device
5,I recommend using on slightly dry hair but works well on straight or thick and curly. Great product!
5,I put off buying YET another styling tool because of you I’ve one you have them all…BOY WAS I WRONG! This straightens and dries at the same time giving me an amazing blowout every time!Super easy to use and you can adjust temp. One pass and my wavy hair is straight; two passes and I have VOLUME!Love love love this product!
5,Made my curly hair straight so easily!
5,"Easy to use and handle.  I like the “low temp” setting because I let my hair dry a little before using my One-Step Dryer and it doesn’t take long at all to style my hair.  Gives lots of volume to my hair, glad I purchased and I think you will like it too!"
5,Omg the best and so cute!
5,Worked well. Helped eliminate frizzies. Easy to use.
5,"I love this air brush. I have short hair and it styles and dries all in one, saves me time and my hair is exactly like I want it. No breakage for my hair either."
5,I liked everything
5,Is quick and easy .. my hair was dried in no time
5,I really like this drying brush. Saves me time with styling as well. I do let my hair air dry before using.
5,I love this hair dryer. Built in brush and dryer is very easy to use. Makes my hair silky smooth. I’ve never been able to make my hair look this good with traditional blow dryers and brushes. I recommend!
5,Very easy to use. Love ❤️ It!
5,Dries my hair in half the time! Looks so much better than when I used my regular dryer and a round brush.
5,Only dryer I use on my hair now. Highly recommend.
5,"This item works amazing! It is easy to use and makes styling my hair fun! It reduces the amount of hair tools that I need in order to look my best. Not quite sure how I made it through life without this! Seller was amazing, fast shipping highly recommend!"
5,My hair stylist uses this and recommended it for styling my hair. Use a heat protectant oil and brush dry it out in sections and layers.Highly recommend
5,Great device that is easy to use
5,I never learned how to professionally blow dry my hair but this made it so easy to style in a short time and with almost no effort!
5,I had psoriasis for years and tried so many different product and only had minimal results. I found this wow product on Amazon and it helped me tremendously. I have since told other about it and they have had the same type of results. Thank you all again.
5,All of the shampoos and conditioners I've tried in the past on my fine textured hair have left my hair weighed down and lifeless.WOW Shampoo & Condioner leaves my hair clean and light and I don't have to wash it every day. Great products.
5,It is amazing
5,Love love this shampoo
5,"The scent was good, though I expected it to have more apple cider vinegar scent than it had. It felt good to my scalp."
5,It makes your hair and scalp healthy feel awesome
5,Works nice on repairing hair and really starting to love the brand
5,I love this shampoo! It smells so good n and makes my hair very soft.  I don’t even need to use conditioner after using this shampoo.
5,"My wife only uses wow shampoo and conditioner and absolutely loves it. Leaves her hair soft, healthy, and makes her hair grow fast."
5,Smells so good left my hair and scalp feeling super clean without drying my scalp & hair out like other clarifying shapoos have a tendency to do.. I will definitely purchase this again I love it
5,Works great on colored hair.
5,After using both of these products for a month now my hair feels really good and has become soft all the junk is out of it. And you only have the use of drop or two you don't have to use a lot unless you have really long hair. The hair conditioner is very for me and feel so creamy on your head and makes my hair feel wonderful. I definitely recommend this product
5,"This is my first time using this product. It really makes a difference! I have very fine, thin, straight hair and WOW! gives it volume, shine and softness .  I’ve used many expensive and not so expensive shampoos/conditioners and this one is by far the best! Highly recommend it!"
5,Best hair product I've ever used. Moisturizes immediately  without greasy feeling. Hair feels freshly cut everything I wash it. Its so soft and healthy. I'm extremely  happy with this product.
5,I love how much softer my hair is after I get out of the shower
5,"I recommend this product. My seborrheic dermatitis decrease, no itchy, no flake, and redness."
5,Love this product. I have very thin hair and it has made a world of difference in the thickness and softness of my hair.
5,"I have done all kinds of wild things to my hair. I have curly, thick heavily damaged hair. Name a color and I have done it, name a tool I have probably used it! After being a very light blonde for almost a year I decided to stop frying my hair with lightener & hot tools all together and began the hunt for the perfect shampoo & conditioner duo! I was already experiencing a large amount of hair fall and figured I didn't have much left to lose, so I went ahead and ordered this product not really sure what to expect as the reviews were kind of all over the place.I have now washed my hair with this shampoo & conditioner twice and I am beyond impressed! The first wash it did feel like my hair clumped together and was going to be impossible to manage but I left the conditioner in for 15 minutes, used a leave in conditioner before combing and it seemed to work just fine.After the second time using this product I couldn't help but notice how soft, and beautiful my natural curls were drying and I haven't stopped asking my husband to smell my hair in days.  12/10"
5,"This is a great product.  I can't believe the change in my long gray straight hair.... It actually shines and is very soft.  I use to have ""very fine"" strawberry blond hair and it turned totally white - the hair became different and hard to work with and now it's pretty again.  thank you !!"
5,Love it! Makes my hair soooo soft and smells amazing!!!!
5,Great products
5,Shampoo smells amazing and cleanses well if you use as directed. (Leave in for 5 min) Wish the conditioner detangled better and smelled like the shampoo tho
5,"Love how my hair feels after a good wash with these all natural products. The coconut conditioner smells so good, all the time. Highly recommend."
5,Love it !
5,This gives your hair a nice deep clean and then conditions so well you hair is left soft
5,"Hair feels soft, shiny and clean. It does what it claims."
5,Works well for my thick curly indian hair.
5,Good stuff
5,Love it..smells so good and thickens my hair...feels so healthy!
5,I have psoriasis and this shampoo and conditioner has worked great with keeping control of the flakes and itchiness
5,"This shampoo and conditioner is the best I have used in a long time it moisturizing my hair  ,it smalls great and leaves my hair soft I will be buying again."
5,My hair definitely feels thicker when wet or dry.  I got this for a change because I had been using Wen hair care products for years and thought it was time for change even my hair stylist noticed a change in my scalp no buildup she asked me if I changed  my shampoo.
5,Wonderful scent
5,I got compliments on my hair condition great soft styles great every one was telling me how my hair smells good 👍🏼 it really works thank you 😊
5,Love this shampoo. This is one of my favorite.  It last a long time before I used it all up. I used very little to wash my hair. It smells good and my hair feels soft.
5,This product works good on my curly dry hair as well as my wife’s whose hair is thin and on the oily side!
5,"I will admit, when you are washing and conditioning your hair with the wow shampoo and conditioner, it does not feel as soft, moisturizing or “untangled” in the shower as my hair does with other conditioners, but once your hair has been dried it feels so soft and healthy and people have mentioned how shiny my hair is since using this product!"
5,"I have had a problem scalp for years and could not find a shampoo to help, until now! Gave it about 1-2 weeks and my issues are taken care of. My hair looks great and both shampoo and conditioner smell good. Will continue to order."
5,"My hair has never been so shiny, soft, HEALTHY till i started using this shampoo and conditioner! I don’t like the scent of the shampoo though"
5,I had to try this shampoo and conditioner and I really like it.
5,My hair feels so clean and light.  Great product.
5,Love the shampoo. The fragrance is nice and works well. Packaging is awesome as well.
5,Works great! Amazing product!
5,Bought this to make my hair thicker. My hair is thicker after a shower but get greasy more easily than it use to .. but I would still recommend to anyone because it makes the hair so soft
5,"I used this for my hair postpartum to ease the fallout and tangles. It helped a lot! It made my hair SO shiny and healthy. The smell was a little bit different but thats a bit to be expected. Ive made DIY apple cider hair treatments at home and I know how bad that stuff smells lol, so I appreciate that this company did their best to cover that up."
5,At first I thought I had wasted my money and was not happy at all! I continued to use and it seems the more I use it the better my hair gets! I am a satisfied customer now! I’m really liking this set!! Especially because I have damaged hair. It did take me three times using before I started liking this but now… I have a much better opinion. It does work!
5,"My hair was WAAAY over processed and falling out, I start using this and it has stopped falling out, and is looking better it’s not an overnight miracle but you can definitely tell after the third wash."
5,I love this shampoo and conditioner!  It makes my hair feel thicker and brighter.  I will order it again depending on the cost.  I got it on sale the first time.  Granny/Nanny
5,This 2 product hair care system is awesome. Works very well and smells good too!!!
5,"Works great,no itchiness, clean ingredients.My waist lenght hair looks shinny and silky.Will purchase again when on sale."
5,"Love it, Love it, Love it....My hair comes out shiny and clean and smells great....No dangerous chemicals.....Natural Clean and Safe Shampoo and Conditioner.....I threw out all my old bottles of shampoo!"
5,"This shampoo cleans your hair squeaky clean, using only once.  The conditioner leaves your hair soft and well hydrated using a small amount. The very best part is you can use daily. I also use WOW Dream Coat for Curly Hair. I totally recommend ALL…love these products.."
5,My hair doesn’t itch after using this shampoo. It must be the apple cider!  The conditioner is the finishing touch because it’s so rich and full of moisturizing ingredients.  I am 67 years old with natural gray hair and this product really keeps the gray hair from frizzing.
5,"Great improvement on the fine texture of my hair. Gave it more body, easier to style and looks fuller. Holds a style longer, does not need a bunch of hairspray. Love the look,  scent  and clean feel even after the first use of this shampoo."
5,Love this shampoo & conditioner.Does what it says.
5,"Love this shampoo and conditioner,  great for all hair types"
5,"Very nice product , pleasant scent"
5,This makes my hair so soft and smells wonderful!! Love it❤️
5,In love with this product I haven’t used anything else besides this for the past 2 years now I also have crazy colors in my hair and it doesn’t seem to fade them that fast so it works on color treated hair as well
5,I love the way my hair feels after shampooing and using the conditioner. You don’t need a lot of product a little goes a long way.
5,I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.I will never use anything else.My hair is so much healthier.I highly recommend them both
5,"This is my go to product. Have even started using the body wash. I also use this on my daughters and notice their hair is growing fast, due to the non chemical."
5,It was decent. Not the worst but not the best. I will continue looking for the perfect product for my hair type
5,Great product like it a lot works very well also stop the itching
5,This product is fantastic - gives great body and softness to my hair
5,Great product at a good price.
5,"Smells great and gets my hair super clean soft and shiny! My hair gets thoroughly cleaned and I absolutely love how the conditioner makes my hair feel. Haven't noticed a difference in it helping with hair loss and breakage, but I've only been using a couple weeks now, and I don't wash my hair everyday."
5,Liked both products
5,This shampoo n conditioner actually helped my hair start growing bk n fall out wayyy less.. im so greatful. I honestly thought i was going to b bald. I had tried everything...little goes a long way with shampoo..conditioner is ok but the shampoo is definitely worth the price
5,Good strengthening products!
5,"I have low porosity hair and I usually get dandruff if I switch shampoos often, but this is perfect for me and the smell is great!"
5,"At 48, I have spent most of my life dealing with scalp issues.  My mom is a red head, so I inherited my pale and sensitive skin from her.  I have dealt with psoriasis, flaking, tightness, itching, and my scalp blistering from using hair products, and then irritated scalp from coloring my hair…it seemed like I would never get relief.  After just two washes with these products, my scalp looks like nothing I’ve ever known.  For the first time, I don’t have flakes, my scalp isn’t itching, no red spots, so sores or scaling.  I will be honest, my hair doesn’t feel as soft after washing and conditioning, but once I’ve dried it, it looks great, so maybe I was just used to my hair having product residue still on it with all the other products I’ve tried.  I love this stuff!"
5,I loved it I believe it's working.
5,"My gray hair is soft, easy to manage and shiny"
5,Great for helping with scalp psoriasis.
5,"Thus product was recommended to me by a dermatologist. It's great, I like it"
5,"Beautification for your hair, lovely fragrance"
5,I will not use other shampoos. I go back to kerastese as supposedly it’s fancy…and I come back to this. Love the results of this shampoo conditioner. Yes so many good reviews are all worth it. Try and you won’t regret. It doesn’t hurt that it’s much better on my pocket than kerastese
5,I really like the product
5,Shampoo and Conditioner are amazing
5,Smells great and makes my hair so soft and shiny! Great purchase!
5,This is the best shampoo I have ever used.
5,"I am certainly “WOWed” by these products!!! Several reviews say to give it time … no time needed here. First try, and I’m hooked!! I’m about 10 months postpartum, and nothing hurts your hair worse than having a baby. lol These products give me shine, softness, and my hair smells GREAT!!! Like even the next day, my hair still smells GREAT!!! Definitely recommend these!"
5,This is a great product
5,Makes my hair soft and clean!! love the smell!! Also works for highlighted hair. Probably one of my favorite shampoo
5,Love love love this shampoo and conditioner definitely recommend
5,"If I could give this product more than five stars, I would.  It is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever purchased. I have fine silver hair and it makes my hair thick, shiny and beautiful. I will definitely purchase this product again. Thank you."
5,"Smells amazing!! Lathers great. Love it! Such a great bargain, my hair gets so so clean."
5,I like the fullness I get from using this shampoo.  I believe my hair has grown since I've used it.  The conditioner is okay.  They both smell good but my hair is still snarly even after the conditioner.  Good product.
5,"I bought a year ago as a flash sale, just to try it. I only use it once a week. But after applying this shampoo and conditioner versus my daily shampoo, my hair is soft and has so much more volume than normal! It's like a spa treatment for my hair. I'm out of product though, so am on here buying it again. And thought I'd leave a review as a repeat customer."
5,I love these products!  The scent is wonderful and my hair is so soft after washing it.
5,"This is really a great product. It had some great reviews on TV so I spent the money and I am not disappointed. My hair became manageable again, it feels fuller, softer and even shinier. I will order it again."
5,Definitely will continue to buy it this. It’s a little drying so be sure to use a really good deep conditioner once a week or so. After a couple weeks I did notice my hair fall wasn’t as bad and I’ve got some new hairs sticking out!
5,It make my hair soft and smells great
5,This shampoo and conditioner are very rich and concentrated. I have waist length hair and need little to get clean and conditioned hair.
5,"I have thin, fine hair and always worry about shampoo & conditioner leaving my hair greasy and flat.  This came highly recommended and I love it.  It smells great,  it works well on my hair and I definitely have noticed less hair fall.  Will buy again.  My one complaint is the conditioner - it is so thick it's almost impossible to get out of the bottle.  The spout lid is laughable on the conditioner."
5,Love this shampoo and conditioner! It is great for my fine hair.
5,Wonderful product!! Will buy again!
5,So far I love it
5,Love the smell and the way it makes hair feel.
5,"So my daughter is really tough to please so I thought I'd try this shampoo,oh also she washes her hair every day, she said it's the best Shampoo.  made her hair soft and clean and she went a day without washing and her hair wasn't greasy and still looked really nice. This product is really good."
5,Will be ordering more as soon as mine runs low. I love this stuff!!
5,"These products have such a great scent, moisturize my hair and scalp so my hair becomes soft, shiny and very manageable."
5,Makes my hair soft and strong.
5,Awesome
5,This is product is good
5,Excelent price for the two products. Good quality and smell awesome.
5,I absolutely Love this combo ... my hair actually stopped falling out and it soo soft .... im hooked
5,"Okay so I have only used this set once now, I'll update in a few weeks. But I can already tell my review won't change. After first shower & following the directions to a tee, my hair feels incredible. I have extremely oily hair/scalp. It is also very fine & straight. I never get volume no matter what I do. It ends up falling flat. Looks like my hair is thinning out, but I actually have a lot of hair. It's just fine. After the first shower my hair felt so soft. I've been bleaching & dying a lot. Made my hair brittle. Not after this wash though! Super silky, Shiney. And I could actually FEEL more volume. The shampoo has a light scent, but good. But that conditioner..OMG. smells like tropical heaven. Left my hair smelling great, even the next morning. My only concern is, not a big bottle to justify $30. Especially when the instructions say to use a lot. Hopefully it'll last a while. I'm still gonna buy it though..lol. great product!!"
5,"I liked it so much, I have already purchased this item for several  friends as gifts.  I love the box presentation as well."
5,Good quality and great price fast delivery thank You
5,This shampoo and conditioner is the best I have used for my hair. Absolutely love these products! I bought my first bottles in January and have just now reordered more.
5,I love these products! Both the shampoo and conditioner smell AMAZING! Just a tiny amount of shampoo is capable of cleansing your scalp and leaving your hair smelling great and looking shiny. I've had this stuff since May 2021 and my hair has grown at least 2-3 inches.Excellent product!
5,Loved this!! Felt the difference instantly after one wash. We have hard water and it has really helped. Made my hair soft and shiny. No smell of vinegar at all
5,"Awesome, this stuff is Wonderful and a great value with fast shipping !"
5,I TRIED SEVERAL OTHER SHAMPOO AFTER USING WOW SHAMPOO. BUT I CAME BACK TO WOW SHAMPOO AND CONDITIONER. THIS IS THE BEST ONE FOR MY CURLY /WAVY HAIR
5,"Wow works amazing, Everyone in my family is now using it."
5,Amazing smells and leaves my hair feeling refreshing and super silky. Love it.
5,"This is my go to wash and conditioner now. It smells great and makes my hair feel incredible! The wash alone is almost enough by itself, if really seems to work well in the cleaning department."
5,I have used this product for a few years. I purchased it to replenish my stock. This shampoo leaves my hair soooo soft and shiny. I love it! Would recommend it to anyone
5,Love it smells  great
5,This shampoo makes my hair grow longer and leaves my hair shiny and soft. The scent is amazing.
5,MY WIFE LOVES IT SO FAR SO GOOD!!!!
5,"I bought the shampoo and conditioner specifically to reduce my scalp itching--it is effective for me if used daily to reduce itching.  The products are great for anti frizz and shine and the fragrance is very pleasing, not artificial."
5,"BUY THIS!! MY HAIR IS SO SHINY!!! AHH!so i dye my hair a lot and i felt like my hair was super unhealthy. i’ve used this for 2 or 3 weeks and my hair is shiny, no frizz, soft, and there’s a lot of volume. it’s been growing too!! i love this shampoo!  my hair hasn’t been falling out! i would look down and there would be a TON of hair falling out! ever since i bought this there has been no hair falling out! i haven’t used any other products btw!! this is great!! i recommend buying this!! BUTTTT the scent is strong! it doesn’t bother me though."
5,I love it.it work well.well worth  the money and smells great.!!
5,My hair dresser swears by this and it was great for my hair
5,My hair has changed a lot since I've been using this product! Less oily and smells great!
5,The first time I used this shampoo and conditioner I noticed a big difference in my hair. I have dry curly hair and it softened it and made my curls look so much healthier. I only wash twice a week and condition in between if needed. The conditioner does a great job for this. I recommend the WOW humidity spray also! Best I’ve used!
5,"I’ve only used this twice and have not seen too much of a difference yet. my goal is to help with my hair loss and try to get my hair feeling healthier! the hair loss, haven’t noticed anything different. after using this the second time tho my hair did look nicer after i blew dried it. i’m gonna keep using this alternating with my shea moisture products as well and see what happens but so far it’s not too bad"
5,Love this shampoo and conditioner. The smell is amazing.
5,Loved the product was skeptical at first if it would grow my hair but after a year of trying my hair is finally growing baby ones and with my change i diet too but it’s thicker hair
5,I love this shampoo and conditioner! The smell is amazing and so refreshing. My hair is stronger and more manageable. This is the product for me. I highly recommend it!
5,"My hair is thicker and healthier using WOW.  Love, love, love it."
5,"This stuff is amazing! We made sure to follow reviewers advice to keep the shampoo on for 5 minutes before rinsing. My daughter and I have both been using and have had amazing results. She has thick, fine, oily hair that is prone to oil-induced dandruff. I have think, coarse, dry hair that is prone to breakage. Her dandruff after using for 2 weeks is completely gone and she doesn’t have to wash it every day any more to keep the oil down. My hair has quit breaking off and stays soft and clean for several days as well. We will be buying from now on."
5,I have thick curly hair and color my hair. I do not shampoo everyday but I use the WOW conditioner everyday to keep away frizz and my hair soft & moisturized. The shampoo does a great job doing a deep clean of all products and making your hair and scalp feel healthy!
5,I like the fell of my hair after shampooing and conditioning.
5,"I have naturally curly and grey hair.  Thought I would try this since I have seen so many ads for it.  I really like it.  It makes my hair soft, tangle free and fuller.  Don't think it helps you grow hair but is really nice.  I have already recommended this to a few people!"
5,Love it!
5,I truly like this product
5,Love love this product your will be so shiny
5,"I like these products because it may cost more than other brands, but it works better than the other onces I tried.  I now do not have to use a volumize product on my hair.  Wow, seams to do the job now!"
5,Love using this. My hair feels great and fuller
5,Love love love this product makes my hair feel so soft and shiny will never use anythg else again
5,I like every thing about it
5,My hair feels so awesome that I recommended it to family and friends.
5,Best shampoo I’ve ever used my girlfriend and I have noticed an amazing difference. Will recommend product.
5,"Since the product contain natural oils, I thought it might make my hair ""too oily"" as I have very fine, already ""soft"" hair.  But this is awesome!  I  for years have a plethora of shampoo/conditioners in my shower (the guys shower their own risk for falling bottles), I believe that having the vinegar in it is very positive as well since it removes ""buildup"" from other products.  I'm dating myself, but when I was a kid we didn't have all these conditioners and shampoo  Breck was the best one and we actually rinsed our hair with vinegar.For me and my daughter, who both have very very fine, straight hair, this duo set works perfectly!  I give it an A++."
5,Conditioner makes my hair dry instead of softThe shampoo on the other hand is working good
5,My hair loves this combo. Soft & healthy looking. I will purchase again
5,My hair has gotten a little thicker and doesn't fall out as much since I have been using Wow apple cider vinegar shampoo for about a year now.
5,My hair is very dry and coarse. This product has made my hair very smooth and soft. Would recommend if needing to make your hair smoother.
5,"Amazing ,after my first time using ,it looked like I had straightened my hair n waking up the next morning u couldn't tell hair was amazing"
5,I have very thin hair and have tried all kinds of products to thicken it up and not make it greasy. In the past few years my hair was in very bad shape. My sister in law is a hair dresser and cuts my hair. I started using the WOW products a year and a half ago and she said my hair has improved 100%.  Shiny and thicker and growing. My son and my husband both noticed a difference in my hair.  Very happy and satisfied with this product !!!
5,"Love this product,my hair is so soft & shinny."
5,Nice feeling the hair gets after washing..
5,"We have gotten accustomed to ordering this shampoo because unlike others, it does not cause hair loss. Smells good and feels just right consistency."
5,This is amazing my hair was thinking and this has made it so much fuller
5,My hair smells soooooo good after.
5,Does exactly what it says it will. I love this stuff.
5,Only used it once so far it seems really nice and it smells really good.
5,"I’m on my second round of both the shampoo and conditioner but I’ve been using the shampoo for a year now.  I’ve always had fine hair so I didn’t expect much in terms of thickness but my hair is definitely growing longer faster and is healthier.  I also have an undiagnosed scalp thing where my scalp gets flaky and scaly and bleeds and I’ve dealt with that most of my life.  I’ve tried every shampoo you can think of from drugstore to salon, if the claim to treat scalps, if tried it.  This is the first time where my scalp looks and feels normal.  I still get occasional itching but that’s all and I can deal with that.  No scaling or bleeding or anything like before.  So I’ll stick with this!"
5,"This is a great shampoo & conditioner. I noticed the thickness of my hair right away. After a couple of weeks my hair wasn't falling out as much in about a month my hair completely stopped falling out and noticed my hair growing and me baby growth.I used this product for a couple of months than changed it for a different product only because I noticed these little tine white ball in my scalp, it was not dandruff though, and No, it was not head lice either! LOLAnyhow, I used this other Keratin shampoo for hair grow but it did not give me the results like I got from the Apple cider Shampoo & Conditioner and my hair started falling out again! So I decided to go back to using the Apple cider shampoo with Conditioner.  : )"
5,BEST SHAMPOO I HAVE EVER USED. I EVEN CAUGHT MYSELF LITERALLY SAYING WOW.
5,"I’ve used this set for the 3rd time now and I’m never going back to Treseme or Joico again.Hair loss for me has gone down like 90%, my hair looks healthy, thick and has shine.I’m currently pregnant and dislike the smell of the shampoo. It’s not that strong like ACV itself but it does have a hint. I get over it once it’s rinsed off and I get to cover it in the amazing conditioner. The conditioner smells soooo good!"
5,Love this product! My daughter and I both use it and it makes our hair super soft and shiny!!
5,Hair washed with WOW instead with H&S•good scent•provided softness to the hair•conditions hair very well•less dandruff after 3 weeks of use.•not too harsh like H&S.•also use it for kids’ hair• kids dandruff was gone after 5 uses.•kids love the fragrance• provided a different dispensing lid fit he bottles in the box• packaging was very good• the bottle slipped and fell so the cap broke. I recommend keeping the original caps just in case.
5,"The name of the brand is no joke... Wow! It works. My hair is so soft and feels clean and healthy, even though I’m overdue for an appointment with my hairdresser. When I blow dry it it looks shiny and strong."
5,Amazing my husband is finally free from dandruff. He was literally having very bad dandruff case I finally see him way better and no more dandruff falling on his shoulders
5,Love this combo.  I am on my fourth order.
5,Conditioner is better than the shampoo.
5,I'm very allergic to most shampoo! This did outstanding and left my hair clean and shiny.A bit pricey but worth every cent.
5,The condition of my hair.  Best!
5,Amazing product love it.
5,I Love the WOW shampoo and conditioner both smell great and left my hair shiny and soft. I will be a repeat customer for sure
5,It worked pretty good
5,It cleans your hair and is gentle.  With the coconut conditioner you will not believehow soft your hair is.  I have noticed that not as much hair is in my brush after usingthis product.  I will buy it again.
5,"This is very nice !  I’m applying it to the eczema on my hand. It goes on easily and does not irritate the sensitive tissue as I apply it. I’m very happy with this Castor Oil!  And of course, it’s organic. I wouldn’t use anything else except organic on my skin."
5,"I love this product! I have been using one my hair, and my lashes.  I removed my lashes extensions and my lashes were non existant.  I started using this and my hair feels so soft and bound and my lashes are growing fast!"
5,This brand of castor oil cannot be surpassed. I have been using another brand for over a year with spotty results.  This brand however supported new brow growth within 2 weeks. I am way happy.
5,Have not saw a lot of growth but it help my hair feels good after using heat on my hair.
5,Very effective
5,It's really good quality. Mine wasn't leaking and packaged well. It's already made my eyelashes longer. It's super thick to put on my hair overnight but it does rinse out well with a good shampoo.
5,This is so so good for hair growth. I get vitamin E capsules and this castor oil mix it and apply it on my scalp. Sometimes I sleep with it over night and sometimes i leave it in for hours and wash it off. My hair the next day feels good and has lots of volume but I do shampoo really good to wash off the oil because it feel really sticky and hard to come out the hair. But hair growth this is wonderful.
5,Amazing product :) My hair is so thick and shiny. I use it at least once a week and leave it on all night.love this product :)
5,"Happy with my purchase, Thank you."
5,"This is food grade so it qualifies as edible. I use it as a laxative, masking the taste by putting it in the refrigerator for a few hours and mixing it in with hot dog relish. Well this one is packaged and advertised as a beauty product, it has many other uses. For me the price was right."
5,Like product
5,I gave 5 star on scent cause there isn't a scent -- as it should be.This is the finest castor oil I have ever had. I use it in my eyes (yes!) To freshen when  tired or if there's dust in them. Also helps reestablish eyelash and eyebrow growth. Excellent dry skin and foot relief.
5,Keep up the great quality 👌 and the same materials used for exceptional customer 👍 👌 uses.
5,I use it to hydrate my lashes everyday and as a hair mask weekly bc I’ve been having dandruff and wow
5,good price and moisturizing
5,"This is great castor oil! Works great for irritated eye lashes, and eye lashes in general. But also strengthen finger and toe nails!!!"
5,"I had lash extensions and they ended up leaving bald spots from where my lashes were ripped out so I used this oil to help those spots grow in faster and it definitely helped, my lashes are back to normal. Also, i over tweezed my brows and this oil helped to grow out my eyebrows to the messiest they’ve ever been allowing me to go get them shaped evenly. I will continue to use this for brow and longer lash growth."
5,My kids hair has grown significantly and has more volume and shine than ever. I love this product!
5,This is great for growing brows and lashes
5,Great oil
5,I have fine hair and a high hairline. Castor oil is a great product to help strengthen hair and is good for the scalp. I am not saying it will give you luxurious voluminous hair. I am saying for me and my hair it has strengthened and moisturized and I think will help to keep my hairline from moving farther back.
5,"I have really enjoyed getting to know Castor Oil from a different perspective than I had growing up in the 50's. It works great on the outside of the body, maybe even better than on the inside."
5,This product arrived on time and well packaged .I have been using this product to help with digestion .it seems to help.my hair and nails look great and healthy.
5,"This product did nothing for me as far as lash/brow growth, however I still like it for conditioning. The cleansers and cosmetics I use dry them out, especially waterproof mascara. For that purpose this oil does a great job, seems high quality, and doesn't irritate my skin or eyes at all."
5,Very good quality. I mainly use this to moisturize my hair and I have thick and kinky hair. The oil is thick so you don't need very much. A bottle can last me about 8 to 12 months. This along with basic hair mantaince has help my hair grow and keeps it looking full and healthy. Highly recommend.
5,"Great for moisturizer and it washes away from fabric easily… such as pillow cases, etc. Doesn’t really have a scent which is better than having a BAD scent I guess :)"
5,Amazing u most order..
5,Prefect 👌👌
5,"This oil came with leak proof packaging that really worked. There was an inner plug under the lid, and tight wrap around the outside container. The oil was also fresh with no rancid odor. 👍"
5,Easy to spread
5,I’ve been using this castor oil for about 2 months and really like it. I notice that my hair is getting thicker.  I let it sit in my hair for 45 minutes with a plastic cap on and then I shampoo it out. I shampoo at least twice as the castor oil is really great moisturizer and if I don’t shampoo it out at least twice it can  still feel to oily.
5,WOW.  This stuff really grows out your eyebrows FAST.  Wish it tinted them too.  Curse you waxing trend.
5,My hair is growing back incredibly this thing works follow the instructions And your hair will start growing
5,I purchased this to help heal a couple scars on face caused by a burn from the dermatologist laser.  The technician had Aerolase laser obviously set wrong causing several second degree burns.  This oil really helped them heal and also helps the rest of my skin.  I have oily skin so seems counterintuitive to use this but it works.  I put on at night and skin is so smooth in morning.  Again counterintuitive but this prevents acne breakouts.  The oil molecule is too large to block pores I have read. Another wonderful side effect is eyebrows are fuller  and thicker since using.  I am sensitive to smells but it is not bad.
5,"Good for eyelashes, makes them look or grow longer."
5,Nice hair product
5,Smells like castor oil and works well. Is organic too which makes it great.
5,I love this product my eye grew . I loss my eyelash because I am taking medication that one the problem . This product help me eyelash and my hair grow.
5,I’ve been using for at least a month now and I actually do see my hair growing back up from a small bald spot on the side of my head. Recommend using every day for faster results. It did come cracked a bit at bottom so that was my only concern with product. But nothing I couldn’t handle.
5,It is great for regrowing hair. Using this to grow my eyebrows thicker.
5,"Love this castor oil, use for many things, from put a drop in my eyes or ears, to simply using as a moisturizer, it's very Greasy though, caution is needed with clothing or bedding."
5,I noticed the difference in my hair growth within 2 weeks of using it. Nice product!
5,I liked everything about this oil. It doesn’t have a scent.
5,I use it on my eyelashes and my scalp. Works great.
5,It feels like this adds an extra layer of protection in my hair!
5,This worked Amazingly well after just bleaching my hair. I added the Castor oil to a bowl and warmed it for about 15 seconds so that way it is easy to spread. I personally left it on my hair while I did my mom duties⏰ and washed it off with Shampoo and used my normal Conditioner after. My hair is Awesomely Hyrdrated and Moisturized👱🏼‍♀️👱🏼‍♀️. Oh and what else?! No Scent😱boom🤯🤯🤯
5,It is very moisturizing and easy to apply on my hair and it's odorless.I will be buying this product again
5,Great scalp moisturizer
5,This product is very good for your skin & hair.
5,Its castor oil....like it says on the label :)
5,It’s perfect
5,No complaints
5,I loved
5,I like this product
5,"Quality product, great packaging. Amazing consistency."
5,Love the light consistency
5,It's great on my skin and the sent is mild.
5,its better than the last brand i used
5,The price for the size is amazing! I personally put a smaller amount in a little squeeze bottle to put on my disposable mascara wands to apply to my lashes daily. I’ve seen growth in just 2 weeks! Do it once a day everyday and you won’t regret it!
5,I love the product
5,"Moisturizing for hair. Great oil, a little goes a long way."
5,Didn’t smell bad
5,very rich  makes skin look great
5,Well satisfied
5,"I’ve never used Castor Oil before but did so after doing some research on it’s beneficial uses. This particular brand is organic, without scent and easy to pair with essential oils. I use it at night for my feet. Since I started training for a half marathon I’ve gotten terrible blisters. The castor oil feels good and helps my skin heal more quickly. I will likely reorder this item when needed - a little bit goes a long way so that may be 9 months from now but I like that it’s made in the US and is all natural."
5,It's a good product.
5,Bought this to help w eyebrow growth. So far so good! Very excited that it is organic and unscented.
5,IT IS AN EXCELLENT HEALTH RRODUCT.
5,Amazing how fast it helped our feet. After a week most of the rough peeling skin is gone. Now getting smooth skin.
5,"I use this product for brows, lashes and hair on head and have noticed it has a definite effect."
5,"I use this for my tummy tuck scar along with a towel and heating pad.  Softens up scar tissue and you can tell it’s healing from within.  My lymphatic massage therapist suggested castor oil for scarring, I never would’ve even knew! :)"
5,Hexane free ; Good product; will order again!
5,Very good quality of oil help to refuse my hair fall
5,Super smooth and thick slow moving oil good on early scars or cuts too to speed up the healing proccess and limit scarring
5,Like this product will re-buy again
5,I used this product to strengthen my lashes before getting extensions- highly recommend!
5,"Good quality product.  And, it is organic."
5,Using to Try and Make HairLine Less Thin; Let’s Hope It Works 🤞🤞🤞
5,I use this for hair care and skin moisturizing
5,Yes I use it to my hair on the skin it’s really good
5,Product works great for moisturizing and getting rid of swelling overnight.
5,I am using this for my hair fall. It’s really great moisturizing and I can feel the wetness on my hair roots. You cna use it alone or mixing with any other oils. I like to keep overnight and wash next morning.
5,"I used this for my hair, eyebrows, and lashes. I don't see a huge difference with hair and eyebrows, but lashes are definitely growing A LOT LONGER. I would 100% recommend this product to anyone."
5,I use it for my hair scent it good and hair feels soft and shiny
5,I literally have only been using this product for a week and my hair is really growing back
5,"This product is absolutely amazing the scent in my opinion is not strong at all, the product is so easy to apply anywhere and seems to help grow eyelashes and helps to thicken up eyebrows. The only con to this product is it is a bit sticky but what can you expect it is an oil. Overall an amazing product and would recommend."
5,the packaging was very nice
5,Good quality! Great for soap making.
5,Love this product. I’ve been using it for years. Does wonders for your hair n a great moisturizer for face n body.💁‍♀️
5,This product has definitely helped my hair but I would recommend mixing it with a lighter oil.
5,Excellent product
5,Very easy to use and my skin feels so good because it’s soothing.
5,I am trying the castor oil on my hair and brows and lashes. It has only been 2 weeks but I am hoping it works.
5,Love this liner. I work in the heat and it stays
5,"Applies easily, very vivid black color, stays exactly where I put it for hours on end, even when I’m sweaty at work"
5,Best liquid liner I’ve found
5,I am very impressed with this eyeliner !! It beats out my previous favorite Stilo.  Glides on so easily!  Lasts the day and washes off easily!
5,Easy to apply. Lasts fairly long for price. Will buy again.
5,Love this! Even I can make a great cat eye with this! 🥰
5,"Soft, pointed brush.  Great application and waterproof.  Lasts all day.  Would buy again."
5,"The eyeliner stays on for a good amount of time . It will smudge /smear after awhile .. don’t rub your eyes . As long as you don’t rub your eyes the makeup shouldn’t smudge . I had to use a makeup eraser to get it off , so I would say somewhat water proof . Last longer than 8 hours :) very happy with product and will be purchasing again."
5,Easy application.
5,All went well
5,This is a great eyeliner. You can get a thin or thick like snd it doesn’t flake. This actually stays on! I wear contact lenses and others get funky or flake and make it impossible to wear. I love this brand!
5,This eyeliner is very easy to use and gives me those sharp edges and corners I want.
5,"I think I have found the perfect liner. The application is effortless, and it looks great. I'm in my 40's and haven't experienced any smudging yet. I would definitely purchase again."
5,"Really cannot express enough how much I love this. I was previously using the Kate eyeliner from Japan. However I can no longer find them where I am, and they're a bit pricey online. I've then searched everywhere for something similar. Everything I've tried in this price range usually sucked! The brush/applicator was usually too rigid or too soft and difficult to apply. This was perfect! I'm in love! Ordering a whole bunch more because I'm so afraid of running out again!"
5,Nice eyeliner that my daughter and I use daily!!! Nice for making the winged eye
5,Easy to put on even while my husband is driving. I get less messes and mistakes.
5,I've decided to switch to brown eye liner.  I like how this went on and the brown is a softer look for my eyes as well as my age.
5,"The tip is firm but not terribly so, makes it easier to get a steady line. It's a fine tip too, for detail application. Sleek dark look. Live it!"
5,Love this eyeliner! Very easy to use! Will purchase again!
5,Stays out and goes on easily
5,I love the way it goes on.
5,Great dark liner! Goes on great!
5,"OK, I just wanna start by saying that I have extremely bad Eye allergies.I am also allergic to a lot of make up. I can’t wear mascara at all, and I can’t wear false lashes because of the glue. I have a hard time with eyeshadows and I have never been able to wear liquid eyeliner because of my allergies. I have been using NYX products for a little while now, especially the eyeshadows and the pencil eyeliners. I decided to just try the liquid eyeliner because it is extremely Cost-friendly And all of the other eye products I have tried from NYX have been OK. I am shocked that I  can use this but I can! I will put this on at 4:30 in the morning and at 7 PM it is still holding strong. I can finally do winged liner And I am so very happy with this product. If you have struggled with my allergies, give this a shot. Even though it does not say it on the box, it is gluten-free, it is paraben free, and it is hypoallergenic. I cannot praise this enough"
5,Easy to apply with control.
5,Easy to apply and stays on without smudging till I remove it.
5,It’s very good
5,Best affordable waterproof liquid eyeliner I’ve tried!
5,I consider myself a eyeliner snob and the reason for that is that I sweat pretty good and on my face. This eyeliner glides on like butter! No lack of product throughout the line. As far as being smudge proof and water resistant...on point! Went through a workout and big grocery shopping trip in 98 degree weather. My face was drenched but my eyeliner stayed perfect!
5,Wonderful product! Will be ordering again
5,Great precision and lots of ink!
5,"I bought this for my daughter who has perfect eyes, not hooded like mine. She’s been making wings since 8th grade and she does it so fast! I can never get my wings to look like hers! This eyeliner is her favorite."
5,"Best eyeliner! Goes on smoothly, doesn't smudge and it won't come of until I take it off!"
5,The liner actually come out very nicely. It pretty water resistance for me. As I apply a bit of water on me. It very longevity as it stay on me for a long time. It also didn’t get smudge when I was touching my eyes. So good product for me.
5,"I was spectacle about this eyeliner being as good as people said it was just because how cheap it is but when I tell you this stuff is amazing I mean it, I’ve been texting it out for the last week I go out on walks with friends a lot and especially in 80 to 90 degree weather I sweat alot, I didn’t notice any smudging at all but the real test was today when I went to kings dominion, with a combination of sweat in 90 degree weather, the blast or air from the rides and water from the splash zone it held up even till right now, it’s lasted since 6 in the morning it’s currently 7pm and still looks like I just did it, I fully got my face submerged under water and sprayed in the face and eyes and it didn’t run down my face at all there was minimum smudging as expected from completely putting my face under in water but I 10/10 recommend it’s cheap and amazing !"
5,I've bought it before and I will continue buying it. Love it
5,The liquid liner is easy to use and does not fade throughout the day. The brown color is what I needed.
5,"I’ve been using gel since I’ve started using eyeliner, the gel liner I was using smudged easier than this, and when I went to take it off it smudged EVERYWHERE around my eye making it so much messier, tested this eyeliner out and it came off so easily and clean. I tested it being smudge/water proof and unless you’re applying A LOT of pressure it won’t smudge! If you use anything other than liquid you should definitely try, it’s so much easier to apply too even!"
5,I love this eye liner! GET IT
5,"I loved how it looked after I applied it, it went on so smoothly, and looked great hours later!"
5,"This eyeliner is excellent! Goes on easily, looks great, wears well and is inexpensive. I'll be buying again!"
5,"OK, so I actually use this pencil to draw and fill my eyebrows in and I will NOT use any other pencil. It's not really smudge proof, it will absolutely smudge, but it is pretty waterproof. I've gone to the beach, and yes I drew my eyebrows on, and they survived sweat and ocean water, granted I made it a point not to touch my forehead as to not smudge them lol but they withstood the water! The pencils themselves last quite a long time before running out and the applicator tip stays nice and pointy. Oh, and the eyeliner has a little bit of a shine to it, it's not matte at all.You will not regret trying this eyeliner."
5,"Easy to use, glides on smoothly. Lasts all day. Very happy with it."
5,Excellent quality and long lasting.
5,"Easy application, easy removal, over all a nice liner, came on evenly and easy from pen tip"
5,"I have worn eyeliner for over 50 years and this one is my #1 go to.  It's not overyly priced, goes on smoothly and easily, and it is even VERY water resistant.  I went swimming without the big black streaks running down my face.  Love, love, love this stuff.  The brush stays moist and useable longer than other brands I have tried."
5,"I can not go wrong with this eyeliner. The product is coming out smoothly, you don't have to go many times over the same spot for the color to be intense.Add a little bit of setting spray at the end and definitely you don't have to worry about the product smudging everywhere on to your eyelids."
5,great
5,"I have hooded eyes and generally tend to struggle with eyeliner formulas that won’t transfer to the top part of my lids. Haven’t had a problem with this eyeliner so far. Also, the applicator is really thin and you can get some really nice and precise lines (this is probably my favorite thing about this eyeliner aside from the smudge-free formula)."
5,Really liked this eye liner. Better than mu Mac.
5,Great price great product thank you amazon super fast shipping 😀
5,I loved this eyeliner. It is very easy to apply. It stayed on for hours
5,Loved and bought more!!!
5,I wish the tip was a tad thicker for better control but I love how is stays on & is smudge and water resistance.  I’ll continue to buy this product
5,My favorite eyeliner of all time.
5,"Easy to apply, strong color, does not smear and lasts all day.Excellent brush"
5,I have tried seemingly a million different eyeliners with varying levels of success. This is by far my favorite! I love the fine point and the precision I get with each line. I will buy this product again and again.
5,I’ve gotten numerous compliments since I’ve started using this. Just the other day at checkout the cashier told me my eyeliner looked so sharp and good! I love this stuff and it’s so affordable!
5,Love the product
5,Beautiful
5,"This was a perfect dupe to the much more expensive Younique eye liner marker that is now discontinued!! Super long wear, easy to apply thick or thin, no smudge and solid color!!!"
5,"Great pigmentation, very soft and beautiful design. I love Nyx! It worth the money."
5,Goes in flawlessly.
5,Was very surprised with the quality for the price! A good product that lasts!
5,Found my new favorite eyeliner. I love Kay vin d but not the price tag. This one is comparable and less expensive. Win-win.
5,"amazing product, cheap and stays forever, doesnt irritate my sensitive eyes, fine tipped and great application"
5,amazing application
5,Love this product!
5,Great eye makeup
5,"I really liked it though I had some problems with the product. Sometimes the makeup wouldn't apply so I'd have to angle the pen a certain way for the liquid to come out. Makeup does come off with a wet napkin, this will leave smudge marks."
5,"Definitely holds true, no smudging. Highly recommend."
5,very good for hooded eyes because it dries quickly. doesn’t last as long if you have more oily eyelids but still lasts the day. pretty waterproof if not fully submerged in water.
5,Love this eye liner! One of my top favorites. It lasts pretty much all day as long as you don’t rub your eyes
5,Fabulous!
5,"If you like a thin line or a cat eye look, then this is the best eyeliner to use.  It allows you to line your eyes with precision and not have to worry about messing it up.  I've never been good with liquid eyeliner until I started using this product.  I hate the pencil liner because it goes on too thick making a cat eye look too difficult to achieve.  So I stick with this product."
5,Love the quality
5,I absolutely love this soft gray colored NYX EYELINER. It lasts n lasts. Is definitely waterproof too. The smudger on the opposite end is one of the best i ever have used. Got it at a good price too as the price point does fluctuate a bit fyi
5,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS EYE LINER.!!!! No more $25 eye liner from Mac that gets lumpy in few weeks.
5,"Smudge proof, lasts all day. Best eyeliner I’ve ever used!! Will definitely keep buying!"
5,This is the only eyeliner that is at a good price point and will last a whole work out! I live in a very humid and gross environment and I’ve been using this eye liner for years. It’s a great doupe for the KVD ink liner and it will last without transfer to your eyelids or smudging.
5,"Great liquid liner. Smooth, no tugging. Accidently slept in it and it didn't budge..."
5,Best eyeliner ive ever used
5,"This eyeliner is easy to apply, dries quickly & stays put. I would definitely buy again."
5,Goes on easily but doesn’t last all day. I don’t have time to refresh. I’m older and now have a shaky hand. This flows well and when I blend with a brush it looks nice.
5,"Easy gliding,stays put,very nice product."
5,Loved how long this eyeliner stated on! Did not budge during a hot outdoor wedding.
5,I really love this product and have re-purchased it cents. It goes on very smooth not bumpy. And if you let it dry it does stay on and it’s waterproof.Definitely worth it’s five stars.
5,it’s just my favorite lol
5,My favorite eyeliner.  Easy to use. Stays on all day.
5,Well its not water proof. And it has a fine tip so good. It’s easier to take off at least but cool. Get it? :)
5,"Be sure to use a light hand bc if you go into heavy you will get a little bleeding of the product bc it’s thin, but if you adjust to that you can get great well defined lines overall for the price I feel it’s the best in its price point."
5,Good liner
5,Great price and very similar to one purchase double the price
5,"Easy to apply, it lasts all day even through those emotional crying days."
5,Just as described so it should work perfect.
5,Perfect! Thanks
5,One of very few I have found available in brown. Goes on easily and stays on well. Thank you
5,It’s my go to eyeliner when I actually decide to wear some. If I prep my face with even just a wash and moisturizer it stays well for me. Lasts me a good chunk of the day/evening and only starts to really smudge right before or during my sleep when I forget to take it off (guilty of laziness). I don’t always use eyeshadow or anything else with it but it’s nice for a eye shadow look or not.
5,"I have gone through pencil, gel, and felt eyeliner and this is the best one that is the most affordable. Ever since i started using this, I have been getting compliments on how sharp my wing liner looks. I have recommended this to all my friends. I have dry eyes so i have to put eye drops throughout the day. And sometimes i forget and i accidentally rub the liner and when i check, it’s still there. Not smudged at all."
5,This is so easy to apply and it stays on better than anything I’ve tried. It really doesn’t smudge. I live in extreme humidity and don’t even have a/c in my vehicle so I sweat a lot. This holds up day after day!
5,"i liked everything about it, good product I would definitely buy this again"
5,"I love this liner. First, it goes on easily and does not crack or smudge. My right eye waters all the time...and this was the answer I was looking for. I like that it is really black black...but mistakes can be cleaned up pretty easy with ruining the whole eye. This will be my go to liner for a good long time. When you get older and your skin is no longer smooth and taunt it is harder to do the perfect eye liner. I am 68 and still love a good eye liner even when my hands are not as  steady as they once were. This is now my favorite go to eyeliner."
5,I honestly didn’t have my hopes up considering the price. But I love it. Its long lasting and waterproof. Definitely will be buying again!
5,Definitely worth buying this compared to $20 or 30 eyeliner pen! Last for a long time and doesn’t smudge at all.This is my 3rd time buying!!
5,"Nice clean line, and doesn’t smudge or rub off when I perspire. My new favorite!"
5,Excellent eyeliner for the price!
5,"Works great! I don't even have to ""set it"" to ensure it doesn't crease. After 9 hours, it looks the exact same. I have it in black and the color is vibrant all day. Tip - takes a learning curve if you are not used to liquid eyeliner - make sure you have a steady hand!"
5,Very happy with my purchase
5,Seriously love this eyeliner! It stays in place even with sweaty workouts. It doesn’t budge with oily skin either. It makes the perfect cat eye too.
5,"I like to do designs and with my eyeliner and this is the perfect tool for it. Hands down best eyeliner I’ve ever used, and I’ve been through a lot of different brands. Literally accidentally slept in it and nothing smeared."
5,"Have always used a small brush liner, this was so much easier and constant flow, love it!"
5,"I am 63 and have been wearing eyeliner since I was 13 years old. I have always used liquid eyeliner that uses a brush. I got this and when I opened it I was like how does this even work as it's not like the liquid eyeliner where the brush goes into the liquid eyeliner, this comes out more like a marker. Well, I LOVE IT! I love it so much, I ordered two more to make sure I don't run out for a long time. Don't hesitate. If I can use this at my age when my hands are not quite as steady as they were in my younger days then you don't need to hesitate."
5,I was ableto get a very sharp looking wing with this eyeliner and I would definitely recommend!
5,I was skeptical but I took a chance and bought NYC eyeliner and I am surprised to say that it does what it says. It won't wipe off easily. I accidentally rubbed my eye and it didn't even smear. I will definitley be buying NYC eyeliner from this seller again. I recommend!
5,This is my new go to. I love this stuff so much. Never using a different eyeliner.
5,Great! Lasts all day... this will be a staple item for me from now on
5,Best eyeliner I have ever used
5,Fabulous product ❣️  I won’t buy anything else from now on....
5,"Nice, very easy to use, I'm not used to own points but this one I like. It last the whole day."
5,"This is the best liquid eye liner I have ever used. The brush applicator is perfect! Always gives me a crisp line with no skipping (and it doesn’t dry out like felt liners end up doing). And lasts a really long time! If you’re looking for an inexpensive liner that performs like a high end brand, look no further. I 100% recommend this one!"
5,I love this eyeliner because it got into my eye once and it didn’t burn my eyes at all
5,Wife loves it
5,"This is a great eyeliner! Most of the eyeliners I’ve tried, even the waterproof and smudge-proof ones, still smudges and I end up with raccoon eyes. This one doesn’t though! Buying it again!"
5,"this is my favorite affordable eyeliner, no need to spend all your money on an eyeliner that does the EXACT job as this one, I'm so happy!"
5,Great eyeliner! Very affordable and really good!
5,one of my favorite eyeliners
5,"Great product, glides easily...reccomend!"
5,Oh my gosh! This stuff is awesome. Made a small mark on my hand and it didn’t go away for days. The longevity of this eyeliner is longer.
5,"Wowza...works great! Goes on easy, doesn’t dry up too quick, and terrific control. Can’t believe how affordable it is."
5,"No problems! I switched back to this after trying some stamped eyeliner, but it burned my eyes so badly, I came back to NYX. So glad I did. I can wear it all day and it never irritates my eyes at all."
5,Awesome!! Definitely recommend it!
5,Works really well last long time
5,the application is so easy and smooth!
5,Is good
5,"It is easy to apply and shape and has great staying power...all day, in front of camera."
5,By far my favorite eyeliner I’ve found in a long time.
5,Glides on so smooth! I love it!
5,"Smudge proof, long lasting, intense pigment, bold color : what is not to love? Totally recommend buying!"
5,"I do not think it is truly water resistance, you can not wear it in pool or gym. But I easily apply it and it stays on very accurately and pretty for several hours."
5,The wife loves it she will be having me oder her some more soon lol
5,"Great coverage, glides on smooth and lasted without smudging for the duration of my day. Sorry, but I didn’t take note how many hours I had it on and didn’t test it out in the water, so can’t verify if it’s waterproof."
5,This is so nice.  applies easily - stays onvery impressed
5,The thin line allows me to create exactly the look I want each time. It does not smudge once it dries in a few seconds. It lasts all day. I have used many different eye liners and finally found one to stick with.
5,This is my go to liquid liner! I’ve literally worn this liner from morning to night without any touch ups. It’s absolutely perfect.
5,I love the way this doesn’t smudge!
5,"This eyeliner is really good, I’ve been using it for quite a while now and it’s just a guaranteed great look. It’s not streaky, is a genuine black with a beautiful finish, and  I love how thin the tip is while also still being thick enough to do bolder lines with ease. Overall it holds up really well to sweat and daily use for all kinds of things (e.g. work, workouts, etc.). It’s 100% worth the buy, especially for its comparability to higher end brands and honestly being better than most in term of quality."
5,I needed one that would be be easier to apply like this one.
5,"It is easy to use.And, I can have it a long time to use.I love it!"
5,I’ll admit for a long time I was kind of a makeup snob. I only used the Marc Jacobs liquid eyeliner pen which is about $30. This NYX one is awesome and even better than the Marc Jacobs one. I will be using this from now on.
5,"This is a really good eyeliner, really easy to grab and apply, and it lasted a long time, however; I don't think is 100% waterproof."
5,Finally an eyeliner that is truly smudgeproof!  Ordered two more!
5,Works as well as my Bobbi Brown.
5,I thought this would be hard to remove but it comes off easy with eye makeup remover or wvwn just washing your face.  Stays on all day no smudging.
5,It’s not really water resistant but it apples good
5,I love this eyeliner! Use it when I wear my makeup!
5,I've used this for years. It lasts and it is easy to apply
5,This makes doing winged eyeliner SO EASY. It usually takes me like 5 minutes to do winged eyeliner but the flexible brush tip and pen like tube allows you to effortlessly draw on your eyeliner
5,"I have been using the Maybelline precise eye liner for years. I think they stopped making them because I can't find it anywhere now. I had been trying different ones to find something as good, but most end up smudging and transferring under my brow. This is the closest I've found to the Maybelline precise one. It doesn't last quite as long, but it doesn't smear or transfer."
5,Great for the price. Love it. I do find it smudges near my crows feet.
5,Petty good for price! Comparable to my Vat Von D
5,"I'm not very good with eye liner pencils and have always used an applicator brush with pomades. I decided to give it try because the price was not too bad. Am I glad I did!! It's very easy to use, dries up almost immediately, does not smudge even if wearing for than 8 hours. My eyes were not irritated either and I have super sensitive skin."
5,Worked great and easy to apply 👍
5,I bought it for my daughter she love’s makeup I have used the liner it’s waterproof for real not like others that claim they’re waterproof but they really not
5,First time I’ve ever bought this. I love it! I use this over my foundation instead of regular powder. It gives me the best looking tan!
5,Smells like coconut sun lotion reminds me of the tropics and goes on so perfectly pigmented and smooth
5,"This is an outstanding product and value. My face just doesn’t tan and I don’t go without sunglasses. This blends perfectly and looks so natural. The coverage is great. A little goes a long way. I’m normally a Bare Minerals user and this covers just as well, but in bronzer form. Highly recommend."
5,Great everyday bronzer
5,Love this bronzer. It’s my go to.  Affordable
5,Great product!  Light is perfect for my light to medium skin tone. Added bonus is that it’s not really a powder so bits of it don’t get all over your clothes or other areas of your skin where you don’t want it.
5,"Such a creamy, blend-able, gorgeous bronzer and it smells great!"
5,"Wonderful beachy coconut scent, glides on with a good make up brush. Love it."
5,"Love the coverage of this product.  2 small complaints....1.  The blush color is too light, 2.  I don't care for the smell"
5,"I have used tons of bronzers over the years and this is by far my favorite I was shook! I have very oily fair sensitive skin and even though this bronzer smells of coconut quite strongly, more than I would like, it does not bother me at all. It glides on really well and last longer than any big namebrand I’ve ever used. The color bronzer was actually perfect for me even though I am super pale I’m glad I went with a slightly darker shade because I don’t need to use much of it. I highly recommend it if you’re on the fence just get it you won’t regret it!"
5,This is a perfect Bronzer creamy and has the perfect color and lasts for good time
5,This lasts well throughout the day. It also has some sun protection.
5,Love this bronzer blends beautifully
5,I was hesitant to buy this at first because I have ridiculously oily skin and most makeup just melts right off my face after a couple hours… but I went ahead and gave it a shot because of all the great reviews and my favorite beauty blogger swears by it. It is a beautiful bronzer and sits well on top on all the different foundations I try and trade off with. The scent is amazing as well and reminds me of something tropical. Give it a try if you’re skeptical. You won’t regret it.
5,First off smells amazing. Creamy and applies smooth. Great for natural looking contour
5,This make up is the best make up bronzer you can buy it's worth writing a review I love it and it smells tropical.
5,It's my first time trying it. And it is a good dupe for the Hoola bronzer. I like the buttery smell too!
5,"I already love physician's formula to begin with. But they're butter bronzers are awesome, smooth, not greasy at all and smell great. I also love the perfume, it smells amazing!"
5,Love this bronzer and it smells like coconuts better than any high end brand bronzer I have used
5,Loved it!!
5,This product is so amazing it smells so good very soft to the skin and you can make yourself look like you have a beautiful beach tan
5,"Great color and super easy to apply! Nice scent, too."
5,gift
5,This item was a gift she liked it.
5,AMAZING
5,"Smells like coconut, smooth like butter, has shimmer"
5,Smooth application the scent is amazing smells so good
5,"I purchased this based on good reviews. I'm 60-ish and never wore bronzer or contoured but decided to try after seeing too much of my own flat-face on zoom meetings. I've already tried a couple of other products which turned out pretty meh. This formula sounded like it would be great for aging, dry skin. Unfortunately, it arrived broken, just like so many others here. Rattling-around-inside-the-case type of broken. There was another blush in the same package that arrived perfectly and the box was in great shape so this felt specific to the product and I think it's the whole 'butter' component. Took about 3 minutes to request a refund and mailed it back, no problem.Yesterday, I made my first trip to W****** in about 4 years and saw this on the rack and let me tell you, it's worth the hype. I'm fair skinned with a peachy undertone and bought the original Bronzer shade. It's lighter than it looks in the case and goes on with just the barest wisp of color that makes such a difference. It blends beautifully. Honestly, I could not believe the difference. I'd catch sight of myself in the mirror and think, my goodness I look good :)So 5 stars for the product but, honestly, this one probably needs to be bought localling if you can find it."
5,This smells so good! Love it
5,"This is an awesome product. As a redhead, it’s impossible to find a good bronzer that doesn’t look orange or weird on my skin. I also have super sensitive skin and this was perfect! Looks very natural, smells like nice beachy/summery sunscreen but feels light and adds a nice color without being too much. If you are a redhead, definitely go for the lightest shade."
5,I like everything about this product. The shade is very natural looking and has been great for sensitive skin. It comes in nice compact with mirror and applicator. I have bought other products of this brand so I had confidence in trying their bronzer.
5,Pretty color. Strong but good coconut-like scent
5,"I’ve always stayed away from contouring and bronzers because they can be too harsh and dont blend well at times, but I don’t have this problem at all with this product. It’s super easy to blend, buildable, great pigment without being too harsh, and gives such a good sun kisssed glow. Definitely recommend"
5,Love the scent! I feel like I’m on vacation! Highly recommend!
5,Smells amazing. Blends very well. Definitely will buy over and over again.
5,Love this bronzer. I have pretty fair skin and this gives a nice glow.. the scent is one of my favorite things about it
5,"I love it, its coconut smell is my favoritego"
5,My sister loved it
5,smells so good
5,Excellent product. Not too heavy.
5,It has a coconut scent but it’s a beautiful color and it’s better than almost any expensive bronzer. I will be buying back ups on this stuff!
5,I love the scent and color..will buy again
5,Love it for a sun kissed look and to add some color back to my face. It takes forever to use all of the product too so one will last you a long time
5,This collection of products is as expected for the price. However I have fallen in love with the lipstick. The bronzer is handy and the grey eyeshadow is sexy. Overall it is a nice start to a  travel make up kit.
5,"I was worried about how this would look on my very pale skin, but it works great! Not too dark, just adds some slight bronze.Looks natural and smells great!"
5,"It’s so worth it. I love the products and the scent of the makeup. Not a big fan of the perfume, too sweet for my taste."
5,Super jenial
5,Love it natural looking bronzer
5,"I have slightly fairer skin, but I tan and don't burn. I have been trying to find a natural looking bronzer for AGES. This stuff is so easy to control (the amount you put on/how dark or light. It gives a nice, subtle glow.  The smell is absolutely amazing. Don't think I'll be using any other bronzer until I find one that tops it."
5,"This is great but as others mentioned, even the darkest shade is pretty light."
5,Nice fragrance. Nice texture. Nice color.
5,"Perfect bronzer, way better than high end stuff"
5,Peachy look for summer. If you want a soft tan it looks best
5,"I love this stuff so much. I have sensitive, red skin. If I blend too much, my face turns red and makes my makeup look AWFUL. This stuff glides right on & blends so easily. better than my Hoola bronzer for sure"
5,This product smells so good and I love the coverage! Super nice just to use for summer!!
5,Loved this product so glad I tried it. The color warm the scent is summer like and the product is long lasting.
5,Love this stuff
5,"Beautiful! Everything about it is so nice. From the minute you open the lid and the fragrance it’s you, to the easy application and the gorgeous color. I’m very satisfied."
5,I love this thing :)
5,Great price and value.  Nice color and brushes on easily and not patchy.
5,This is my favorite bronzer.  Thanks for shipping it fast!
5,"Love this, especially for my sensitivity with anything. Is perfect."
5,The smell! I honestly did not think much about it but when I got it I was taken to a tropical vacation (obviously kidding) but it does smell like coconut! I Love it!! It works great to give you that extra glow.
5,"I am very fair skinned and I have not had luck finding a nice cool toned bronzer for my face since benefits hoola bronzer. That one soon became out of budget for me so I had to find a more affordable option. That being said it’s been hard and I’ve looked grey orange brown and every other shade in between since then. THIS right here is my new holy grail I will purchase and repurchase until they discontinue it and even then I’ll bid for it online. The perfect cool tone for my face gives me a nice bronzed look without making me ashy grey or orange. The smell is interesting it legit smells like butter to me which I don’t love, but for the amazing product you’re getting I can easily overlook that. Also!! Amazon has the best price for this baby. In stores it’s around $14 or so, so buy it here but it now!!"
5,Love and the smell is amazing.
5,I love this bronzer and it smells amazing
5,A favorite purchase of mine. Definitely my on the go look! The powders are so silky.
5,"I like this shade for my fair neutral skin. It’s buildable and blends nicely. The scent is good too, beachy."
5,"Smells good but the smell doesn’t last.  Kind of wish it did!  Nice bronzer, goes on nice and stays on.  Includes an applicator but I use a large soft brush.  Looks nice.  I’m fair skinned but I got the darker one after reading reviews.  I just go easy with applying and it’s great!"
5,My new GO TO for the summer. And the smell is so nice
5,I use a light fluffy makeup brush to put this on a well-moisturized face. After the moisturizer has soaked in really well then I lightly brush it across my face. I like the brush better than the sponge which comes with it but that is a personal preference. The container is really easy to open and I can put a tiny fluffy brush in the bottom of the container and the sponge on top of the bronzer.I have also tried putting on lightweight makeup since I am really fair and then light dusting of the bronzer over it. This works as well.
5,"Love the smell and love how it looks on me, I have olive skin tone and packaging is lovely"
5,I’ve used this product for a couple of years and love it.  I recently traveled and it broke so I reordered through Amazon.  Received quickly.  Love the color!
5,"I picked this up because my daughter loves makeup and we have similar complexions. Even though she does use some high end makeup she loves this product! I tried to find this color in local stores and they were sold out or didn’t carry PF.The packaging is so pretty, it smells amazing but not overwhelming. I love it, it will last me forever because I don’t need to use much. Great product for the price point ."
5,"Love it! Smells wonderful, goes on so smoothly with a smooth appearanceGreat for sensitive skin. I ordered bronze and I am light to med skin tone it was perfect.Highly recommendI won’t purchase any other bronzer now"
5,"Smells super good! Very pigmented and easy to blend , just don’t put too much because it’s very warm toned."
5,Smells great. I have sensitive skin and this worked wonderfully for me. I love the sponge brush that it comes with and the holes in the bottom of the case where the sponge sits so it can air out.
5,It’s good
5,So pretty!
5,"Works so well, light on my skin and smells great!"
5,Perfect for fair skin as summer begins!
5,Beautiful shade for Summer & lasts all day!
5,Love it! And the smell!
5,Really like this product! Works for many skin tones.
5,Love it.
5,"Great, super concentrated formula. Smells amazing. Will last me foreverrrr."
5,I love this collection..the colors are perfect and shimmery...
5,"This is great!  Finally, a bronzer for fair-skinned people!  This product goes on nicely and I love the little foam brush that is provided.  It gives a nice glow to your face without being too dark, but you can build on it if needed."
5,The most amazing bronzer out on market !! It’s natural looking and easy to use . Love the smell too !
5,BLEND-ABLE BUILD-ABLE RICK VIBRANT
5,"Lovely matte bronzer with a light delicious scent of pina colada. It's very blendable and doesn't irritate my very fair, very sensitive skin. A small sponge is included under the pan, which is great for applying the bronzer right where you want it, then it blends like a dream with a brush. Would definitely recommend!"
5,its like a powder and a liquid makeup all in a powder. works very well and feels soft on the skin. would recommend
5,I use this and I purchased for my daughter. She loves it too. The smell is fabulous. I love the coverage.
5,I love the smell of this and smooth feeling of application.  I regularly buy this.
5,This is so awesome
5,"This smells amazing, kinda reminds me of the hoola by benefit. The difference I’d say is a lighter warm tone but it’s beautiful and buildable. Look like I’m bronzed and not just pale with anxiety. But Golden with anxiety."
5,My favorite bronzer and use it for highlighter and eyeshadow as well!
5,Love this !
5,Love this product!!!
5,This covers my uneven skin type great coverageGives the appearance of healthy skinGives to a glow
5,Smells SO GOOD!!!! New favorite
5,"Literally blends like butter. Smells amazing. I’m pretty fair and I don’t have to use much, but this creates the perfect bronze look! Doesn’t get splotchy or feel dry."
5,I love it. I have never used a bronzer before. It's a game changer for a 70 year old woman.
5,"After resisting purchasing this for so long, I finally did buy it and it is everything it's cracked up to be,  and more!!  I'm tired right now, so will come back and edit this review,  and add details another day,  but I love the bronzer!! :)  OK--Edited to add-- only thing I don't agree with which everyone else raves about is the scent. I think it has the scent of additives which aren't natural,  certainly not butter or coconut,  however it doesn't last for long after using the bronzer. It's not such a  big deal :)"
5,"Smells nice, and covers well. Very pleased with this product."
5,The smell is amazing....like Hawaiian tanning lotion. Hands down.. best bronzer out there!!!
5,"Physicians formula bronzers are gorgeous. Super blendable, not muddy, just fantastic"
5,Perfect color for lighter skin
5,My favorite bronzer on this planet. The smell alone is amazing. It blends out perfectly. I would never switch to another bronzer.
5,Smells great
5,Love physicians formula!
5,Came perfectly. No cracks or anything
5,Great value and product
5,"This is one of the best bronzers I have used. I love it so much I purchased another in a darker color. I have sensitive skin and I am totally ok using this, there is a slight scent and usually I am pretty picky about stuff like that but it isn’t strong enough to really be a problem."
5,"This is a good bronzer. It does what it’s supposed to. I have medium skin, and it gives a little definition and looks sun kissed. I’ve gotten compliments on my “tan”, lol. I wish they used other ingredients besides talc, but I don’t wear it often."
5,"Switched from the benefit bronzer, great dupe, amazing smell"
5,This is very soft and smooth. It does not irritate my skin and I like the color
5,This is my all time favorite drugstore bronzer. Smells great of you enjoy coconut. This products goes on buttery smooth as well. HIGHLY recommend!!
5,"I went through a makeup phase, and I've owned an embarrassing number of bronzers ranging from drugstore to high-end. This remains as one of my all-time favorites. It's not too loose or compact, so you pick up a perfect amount of product on your brush. It looks seamless, blends easily, and the color has the perfect balance of golden undertones with a touch of red (to look realistic). The smell is definitely coconutty and can be a lot for some, but I personally love it. The only downside is the packaging - it's a bit bulky to travel with, but I also travel with a separate brush and mirror, so I don't need the ones included. I have light to light-medium skin tone, and I purchased the regular shade ""Bronzer"" - it looks perfect."
5,I haven't worn bronzer in ages and this felt so buttery and good on my skin! I'll be buying again!
5,Goes on smoothly and smells good
5,"I have very sensitive acne prone skin, but I’ve been using this for 2 weeks already and I love it!!! Love the scent and the color is amazing...It’s not too dark... overall great buy!!!"
5,"I really like how this bronzer creates a natural look. I'm cool toned and I ordered the ""butter bronzer"" color. It did not show up too dark and it was light enough to where you could notice the difference. This product has a silky feel with no given personal skin irritations and smells amazing too."
5,Love this stuff!
5,All the hype and more! This bronzer is now my personal favorite. The smell only lingers for a min or two. I don’t use much product. The formula is buildable and leaves a wonderful natural bronze.
5,Love this stuff! Smells amazing and works so great as bronzer and an eye shadow.
5,"Love this! I usually use Hulu bronzer from Benefit but thought I’d give this a try. I won’t be going back to my old bronzer. This smells good, reminds me of summer and makes my skin glow."
5,Smells like butter ....And also works good
5,Love Anything physicians formula! Lightweight but still great look and coverage!
5,"Excellent for my sensitive skin. Its a lighter bronzer, so its perfect for my pale complexion.  Lasts all day and looks great!  The applicator storage beneath the compact is a nice touch!"
5,This smells so good! Love the color as well!
5,It blends so smoothly and smells good
5,My favorite. Everyone has been using it so I thought I would give it a try. It will be the only one I buy from now on.
5,"I use this as a highlight and a contour! This smells great, goes on smooth and not to dark and not to light. I don’t use the applicator it comes with, I prefer to use my own makeup brush. Great product!"
5,"I love this product so much! It compliments my skin tone so much, smells amazing, and came just as pictured."
5,"My wife says: ""The best bronzer I have used. It doesn't look too orange or dark on my pale skin."""
5,I bought this after seeing it all over TikTok. It smells great and blends well to my pretty pale skin. I will even someday use the bronzer in my eye makeup in my crease in a quick weekend look.
5,Beautiful color and not orange looking and went in so smooth!
5,"Smells amazing, beautifully packaged and it’s very soft. Perfect tanned look."
5,This is one of my favorite bronzers. It's very natural looking and it smells nice too!
5,Great product with wonderful shade to add the look of the sun on your face!
5,Smells like coconuts! This isn’t my first choice for bronzer but it works!
5,Smells great. Applies smooth. Provides a beautiful finished look to your makeup routine.
5,"Been excited and pumped for this product, as many people recommended. The color is amazing and scent is the best. Will buy again for scent and summer feel and color."
5,Love the whole package. Great product.
5,"I love this product! It smells great, smooth consistency, pigmented- all around great product. Worked for my fair skin and tanned skin as well."
5,LOVE!
5,This is just the perfect bronzer ever! Loving it
5,ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS BRONZER! So soft and sun kissed glowed !
5,"I was skeptical at first but once I opened this, the fragrance brought me back to summertime as a child with its tropical, Coppertone sun tan lotion-like smell. I read the reviews to get the shade just right for me as I didn't want anything near orange.Take a few to ensure you pick the correct shade for your skin tone and you'll end up loving this bronzer."
5,"I love everything in this kit. The eyeshadows are a little dark for me personally, but I still use them by blending with other colors. The scent of the perfume is amazing and the products work great."
5,This smells like I am on a tropical island in the best way possible. Love to brush over the top of my foundation to give my winter Midwest skin a little kiss of color!
5,"worked for my skin color and blended very well, liked it"
5,"Smells fantastic, first of all. Lol Secondly, it blends so nicely and I'm not even a huge fan of powder bronzers. I normally just use my Rimmel duo stick, but this bronzer has such a smooth finish! And the color is perfect for my pale skin. I'm a red head, so I struggle with most bronzers being too dark to blend out well. This one in the shade Light Bronze is amazing. I don't look like an orange clown. Lol The ONLY negative thing I have to say is what the heck is up with that weird little applicator gadget? Hahaha That thing is useless. I use my makeup brushes to apply it instead. I'm sure most of you will too."
5,It was great
5,Great design for compact!  Color and size perfect for me and comes with spongy - easy wash applicator!
5,"Read great reviews on this so I wanted to try it.  The smell is amazing!  Very beachy, like suntan lotion.  If you’re sensitive to smells this might be too strong for you.I got the bronzer color, and it’s a great color on me.  I’m fair to medium complexion.  Oh and no shimmer or sparkle to this, which I appreciate.  I’ve already recommended to a friend!"
5,The smell is amazing!
5,"Loveee it!! Smells so good, and looks amazing. I have very fair skin, and this is the perfect shade. Easy to build up so you can go for a more dramatic or subtle look. Great price too, I like this one more than too face's or bobbi brown's 😳"
5,Great
5,"it's so beautiful, it smells BOMB and it makes me look so good! it blends in SOO WELL. BUY BUY!!"
5,The color is a bit too light for me yet I love the way it smells
5,Why didn’t I know about this sooner.It’s the perfect cool tones bronzer for me. It made my skin look flawless.I love it.
5,"The only bronzer I will ever use. It is SO cute for summer. When wearing a tank top, try putting some on your shoulders and color bone. The shimmer and bronze is so cute on tan skin"
5,"I love the scent and doesn't bother my sensitive skin. This is good for fair skin, it shows just enough."
5,"The color, scent, and formula is wonderful! It is so easy to apply and blend with a brush. I love how natural it looks."
5,"Beautiful color and formula. It's my go to bronzer every time I do my makeup. The scent is wonderful, blends great and perfect color for my light skin tone."
5,"Very nice drugstore bronzer. I got the Light Bronzer and original Bronzer shades and, as of January 2021, they're still coming from Amazon in the packaging with yellow letters (I wish it were the newer, more elegant package, to be honest). It has a smooth application with a little bit of sheen but no chunky glitter, and a strong but not unpleasant fragrance. The packaging is a little bulky and I wish it didn't have the characteristic ""hump"" on top, because it makes it harder to keep organized in a makeup case.I'm pretty fair but not the palest, usually within the first couple of neutral shades for most foundations, ie MAC NW15, Maybelline 115 Ivory, Juvia's Maricao. The light shade doesn't leave a ton of pigment but is buildable, so it's a good shade for people of my coloring who like a very gentle bronzing effect, or folks who are a bit paler than myself. It doesn't look orange on me, and the sheen isn't enough to emphasize light skin texture. The original Bronzer shade is still pretty subtle, but it's easier to see on my coloring.I'm currently awaiting delivery of the original ""Bronzer"" shade just to compare the colors. I'm hoping it comes in the newer, less cartoony packaging style."
5,"a little orangey for my pale tone, but works great when used conservatively"
5,I love the scent of it not too strong but smells delicious.
5,"I really love the scent but it is strong, so might not be for everyone. This bronzer is very subtle but just warms you up. I tend to use it everywhere, perimeters of my face, neck, eyes, you name it. It really is the only product I have found like it. It's not sparkly, or shimmery, just smooth glowy and warm. It's perfect. Very similar, but dare I say, better than benefit hoola! Hoola is more neutral and this bronzer is warmer so not a perfect dupe but equally wearable and impressive I would say. Hoola is more powdery and this product is smoother."
5,I have super sensitive skin and a sensitive nose. I love that this basically smells like cocoa. The color is beautiful and blends well.
5,subtle but noticeable glow on my fair skin
5,"My friend bought this and let me try it and I immediately fell in love so much I stole hers and then bought a new one as soon as it ran out! The smell is heavenly, its buildable so I always start with a little and add on as needed. I dont use the applicator it came with though so I can't say how well that works. I'll probably never try another bronzer in my life!"
5,"I absolutely love this product. It blend was on the skin, applies super well, overall a great experience! I would say the only downside is if you don't like scented products, this isn't for you. It definitely has a strong coconut smell, that can feel a bit overwhelming at first."
5,This bronzer is beautiful! It smells so good and blends like a dream. If you're light complected it can even second as an eye shadow.
5,Omg this smells so good! I love the smell and it is a nice calm color. I am super pale and it doesn’t make me orange. I got it because I am on zoom all day and I was looking paper white. This just gave me enough bronze that I don’t blend into a white background lol.
5,"I was skeptical to buy this, absolutely love it. It's very buttery and smooth and soft and easy to put on and the packaging has a little mirror"
5,Makes me feel like I'm on a beach! Amazing scent and great quality. You gave it the right name - Sun Kissed.
5,Love this stuff. I use it mostly as blush. It smells so good!
5,works well and smells AMAZING. Plus it's super cute with the palm leaves. Great bronzer.
5,Love this brand of blush.  Didn't really like the brush that came with this one though so I just used a previous brush I had.
5,This is a very good under eye concealer. Goes on so smooth with very little fuss anduuss. Quick swipe and blend. Love it
5,My favorite
5,The best concealer I’ve ever used
5,So happy with this purchase and it’s always exactly as everyone says in reviews ... amazing in every way!! I hope they never stop making it. The color HONEY is my favorite amd I have medium skin with pink undertones because I am English.
5,The best ever!
5,I use it almost everyday. I lasts and does not crease. It is easy to apply.
5,I got both the medium and sand shades! Love the sand for under eye and the medium for touching up my makeup on the go! A must-have in my makeup bag for traveling!
5,Covers my under eye circles and melisma wonderfully. Covers just as well as the more expensive concealer at Sephora.
5,Concealer by Maybelline perfect
5,The coverage was good for such a light feeling product. I wouldn’t say it’s full coverage. It’s a medium coverage with a light silky feel. I would buy again.
5,"It works as a concealer, contour, or even toner. It is perfect for every need and very small so it is portable and you can use anywhere!"
5,Creamy and moisturizing. Just perfect. Will continue to purchase indefinitely
5,I have always had luck with Maybelline and they continue to provide great products!  Easy to apply and the correct shade works well for me!
5,This is great for highlighting and counteracting the dark circle under the eyes without being cakey and settling into fine lines. This works great for a highlighter on the nose and cheek bones
5,"I’ve been using Nars concealer since I ran out of Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Concealer. I’ve read Nars is the best, give me Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Concealer any day. Goes on much smoother, sheerer, doesn’t highlight your wrinkles, rather smooths them. Highly recommend."
5,Easy to use
5,Best concealer money can buy! I even bought a couple that are a little darker than my complexion to use are a contour and it blends and looks absolutely flawless! Very impressed!
5,I must say I love the simplicity of this product as well as how good it works! I will definitely be reordering this product!
5,This product provides excellent coverage.
5,I love everything about it first time buying this concealer and will buy it again
5,"As a career woman for 40 years, I would never have used a drug store product on my face. No, ma'am, I was a Dior girl all the way. But after retiring, I could not justify spending the cash on cosmetics. So, after reading some ""4-5 star"" reviews, I decided to try Maybelline foundations, concealers, and powders. Am I glad I did! They are wonderful, and yes, comparable to high end brands. Cannot say enough good things about their products."
5,my favorite!
5,Like the product. Easy to apply. A good purchase
5,perfect product
5,This concelear it's great!
5,Feeling like the undead due to lack of sleep? Waking up all hours of the night to feed a tiny human? Do you then have to go outside in the bright world the next day and would like to look like you slept more than 3 hours? Well this is for you then!This brightener concealer does wonders to hide those oversized bags that airlines would charge you extra for. Just dab some of this magic goo under your eyes and blend in with a small makeup brush. Then voila you look like a normal member of functioning society that knows what the back of their eye lids looks like.*warning* does not help you sleep better or feel better about the tiny amount of sleep you got while your husband slept like a rock. This product only makes others think you dont want to hit him at 2 am when the baby is up again and he is sleeping through it all.This is not a paid review I just couldn't go back to sleep at 3 am after baby woke and thought making you smile was a good way to pass the time.
5,Liked how smoothly it came on.
5,"Ease of use, good coverage but not heavy. Have ordered three times and will continue to use"
5,LOVE IT
5,I love this stuff and it was shipped well and quickly
5,This is absolutely a great product and I wish I  would have known about it years ago! It doesn’t cake in wrinkles and provides a nice cover over flaws! LOVE it and will definitely purchase it again!!
5,"I’m happy with this concealer. I was hesitant at first because of all the other brands that I’ve tried and have failed to do what they claim. But for the price, I figured I’d give this one a try. I have light skin, so matching the shade was a little confusing to me  because I wasn’t sure if the shade would work with my cool undertones. I went thru the reviews, someone mentioned that they have cool undertones and light skin so I went with the review to guide my purchase. The light 120 shade was a perfect choice and I was pleasantly surprised. There was no fuss with applying the concealer. It easily glides on. The texture is just right. It’s not too thick or thin. It lasts almost thru the whole day. I say almost because for me, it didn’t last 8 hours like it claims on their website. Maybe 6 hours for me, but then again I live in a humid climate so that may be why.  I still love it though, because it conceals pretty good!"
5,Thank you it's perfect
5,My go-to concealer :)
5,"This concealer is the best! It covers better than any other I have ever used, is non drying without being greasy, does not settle into lines, lasts all day and the application is effortless I honestly have not used or purchased another brand since my first purchase of this product several years ago. I am never without a spare! Do yourself a favor and give it a try. I have learned that products reasonably priced can be superior to so many over priced makeup items on the market that do not deliver.Yes I  love this product!!"
5,Fades well. Looks natural. Very light weight on the skin good cover
5,This is perfect and I will definitely buy again
5,I didn't think I would like this product but to my surprise I love it and use it daily. Fact is it just makes me look a little better. I don't like having dark circles under my eyes or hollows into my cheeks. This erases anything you want to cover. You look better in a photograph.
5,"Goes on so smooth, perfect texture, excellent applicator.  I will buy this over and over.  Highly recommend if you need to cover up those spots under your eyes, or just want to brighten up your eyes."
5,Works well to cover dark spots and uneven skin tone.
5,"Might take some time to guess the right color/shade for your skin, but gives great coverage and is easy to use! Would buy again."
5,Works great
5,I really liked this concealer. It was easy to apply and covered well.
5,"Best product for lightweight coverage I’ve ever found.  Love the texture, packaging and ease of application"
5,The applicator tip is amazing!  Love this product!
5,This is the 2nd time I've purchased this - love it!
5,I use this product regularly. It's easy to use and covers nicely.
5,This is a fantastic coverage for blemish to wrinkle.Product keeps fresh until you turn the dial.
5,"Easy to apply, dries quickly, good coverage"
5,"This concealer is awesome! It’s very easy to use and covers beautifully, giving me flawless even skin. It evens out the darker areas of my face. I have so many half used expensive products in my bag that did not live up to this same claim. I am ordering two more to ensure I don’t run out! All levels of skill can easily use this."
5,Covers up dark circles very good
5,"I was skeptical of a $5 product...however, this product quickly proved me wrong!! I'm a 35 year old single mom with a demanding career. The darkness under my eyes is atrocious, but the brightener made it non-existent!! I'm a believer and will be a loyal fan for life!"
5,"This concealer is one of my new favorites. It has great, light coverage, and the sponge applicator makes for easy blending. For the money, it’s definitely the best I’ve ever used!"
5,New favorite beauty product
5,This is the Best cover-up of them all buy it now❤️
5,I would recommend it as a good spot concealer
5,I was looking forward to trying out this concealer; just not able to do so. Turning the top and squeezing gently-still nothing?
5,Great product coverage is great
5,Love love love this product 😍😍😍
5,Super blendable and does not highlight lines
5,"I barely wear makeup but since I am getting older I am noticing my dark circles and age spots so I figured what the heck I’ll try this crap. Omg I love it!! It blends nicely and is easy to spread. Thisis all I use, it eliminates my dark circles and spots. I purchased two different shades."
5,Applicator leaks.It is a great concealer!
5,Wow. I really liked this product. I wasn't sure about the color but it was perfect. I used Mary Kay foundation 105 Ivory in the past but I now prefer not to wear makeup every day so I wanted something less expensive. This is a gentle cover. I can use in spots and it blends well with my skin. I wasn't exactly sure how to use it but it was easy to figure out. Definitely try this out. I will purchase again.
5,Great coverage and doesn’t leave area applied to dry.  Recommended
5,"Thrilled with this product!  So much so that I ordered a second time to make sure I didn't run out.  This is the first concealer I've found that covers without caking, hides dark circles and moisturizes without being weighty.  Please don't ever discontinue this product as it's currently manufactured."
5,"This is by far the best concealer/foundation I have ever used. It covers acne scars and under eye circles beautifully. I actually just use it under my eyes, and on acne spots before applying powder. Looks like a full coverage job."
5,I like the way it spreads easily
5,Love this brightener. Definitely will continue purchasing this product.
5,"For me it is one of the best concealers on the market, not only for the price but also for the quality of the product."
5,Liked the sponge tip and the fact that it covers age spots so well. Very easy to apply too.
5,Super recomendado
5,Yes I will most def.  buy again. Coverage is smooth and build able and many colors to choose from.
5,Nice coverage.
5,Sheer and covers bags under eyes very well. I recommend this product.
5,The best product! Really blends well and brightens my under eye area. I love using it on my eyelids when I don't wear eye shadow some days. Doesn't flake or crease as the day goes on. Love this product!!!
5,"Easy to match skin tone, easy to use, nongreasy, natural look."
5,Love this concealer! Covers well. Long lasting. Easy to apply.
5,"Spreads easily, covers well, not cakey."
5,"I absolutely love this concealer! I can see where the hype came from! It is so easy to blend and just looks flawless on the skin. It’s a tad bit drier than other concealers I have. But overall, it’s a must have!"
5,"Maybelline is owned by L’Oréal - they are the largest makeup company in the world. Google them to see how many brands they own- I think it’s almost 40- urban decay, YC, Lancôme, Nyx, and many many more…. So when you start off your review saying that you use YC or Lancôme - you are using one of the many many brands of L’Oréal. That said- this concealer is very good. The brands that I use are: il makiage, tarte shape tape, Purlisse, complex culture, elf, wet n wild, Milani, Charlotte tilbury, Giorgio Armani, IT Cosmetics (another L’Oréal owned brand) yensa, real her, dose of colors, colourpop, KVD, Anastasia, makeup forever, wander beauty, Nyx can’t stop won’t stop, Maybelline fitMe, hey honey, Sephora, I honestly have a serious makeup addiction. I know I left out quite a few. I have 4 extra large organizers, and 3 small ones, one rotating tower, and a 2 drawer table filled with palettes from everyone.I could’ve stopped buying makeup after I bought this concealer, and the Maybelline total temptation eyebrow pencil, as well as the fitMe matte pressed powder, foundation, and the urban decay palettes. There was simply no need for all those expensive brands I mentioned. I love maybelline.  I love urban decay eyeshadow, and Maybelline mascara. I did just order a Nyx primer that got amazing reviews.Bottom line- all of you makeup “snobs” lol, this concealer is everything. Im no snob, I’m just a lover of beauty and beautiful cosmetics and I keep 90% of my products in their boxes, and my vanity is gorgeous and well organized with all the pretty packaging. But my goto “holy grail” is always this concealer- in different shades- one for contour, one for brightening, one for concealing. I just had my eyebrows permanently tattooed (at La Femme Permanent Makeup & Esthetics) as well as my lips. They use PIGMENTS not INK- so if you are thinking of having it done make sure you research the person doing it, because ink is a no-no.I know this is a long review.  Partly, I was responding to a few ppl’s reviews that asked for a comment on their review which I don’t think is possible. We can click “helpful” but we cannot respond to reviews directly. I hope this gets posted so that those self proclaimed “snobs” can see that there’s no need for that expensive makeup when there are products like this concealer out there. Im no snob- but I definitely love to try as many products as I can, because playing with makeup is fun! But the only products that I will buy again and again, are this concealer, and other Maybelline items. Then I can save my money for clothes & shoes :)"
5,This has great coverage and is so easy to use.
5,This is my go to concealer!  I love how the sponge on the applicator is so easy to use.  It’s definitely my favorite concealer.
5,"I was blown away by this concealer when I used it as both a concealer and as an eye shadow primer. There is minimal creasing, it's buildable, and it offers pretty great coverage for my genetically very dark under eye area. This out performs most high end brands. I'm astounded."
5,"Definitely helps cover under eye circles. I have always had dark circles and always will. This is one of the best concealers I have used. Lots of shades to choose from, too."
5,I like the ease of application and the fact that it isn't heavy.  Perfect for an under eye cover.
5,This color matches my skin tone exactly so I usually combine it with a lighter color to highlight certain areas and to help get rid of my dark circles. It’s very natural and I love this product
5,Excellent color match. Goes on light and easy and looks dewy and fresh
5,I have been using foundation or foundation powder for years without covering up my blemish sites first. What a huge difference this made in my overall look! It evened out my tone and brightened the areas I wanted brightened. Really impressed.
5,I've been using this product for at least ten years and I absolutely love it.  It's long lasting and a little goes a long way.
5,"This concealer is a little miracle to me.  It is creamy, so it doesn't give you a cake-y or dry look, but is still opaque enough to give you coverage.  It is just very important to get a shade that matches your skin and make-up color.  A note about the applicator:  When you turn the top of the tube, the concealer comes up through a sponge applicator.  I didn't find that to give me a smooth application.  I took the sponge tip off and I just take a tiny dot of the concealer on my finger and apply it that way.  Much more control."
5,This Is the perfect size to carry in my bag for touchups
5,It’s everything the ppl have said it isss!! In my 40s & wear very little makeup but definitely need this for under eye darkness & sunk in eyes
5,"I love this concealer: I am very pale, and many other brands are very heavy on my skin.  This concealer has great coverage and wears long, plus it's easy to just keep in my purse and touch up when necessary without additional sponges or brushes."
5,This product didn’t give me no creases what so ever and usually products give me the worst creases but it’s so moisturizing that it just stays beautifully! Nothing negative to say about this although I did order the wrong color it was too dark so that’s on me lol
5,Excellent product
5,"So easy to apply and blend, worked great"
5,Had been using the same brand yet the typical beige colored under eye concealer. This is even better! Looks so natural and bright after using and its so simple to put on. I have an organic version of this of another brand but needed an economical every day version to slip into my purse.
5,Blends really well
5,I like the easy application! It covers wrinkles under eyes well!
5,Once you start you will ALWYS dermaplane. Amazing! If you havent done it...there are how to videos on Youtube.These blades are easy to use and come with a separate cover to help cleanup eyebrows. I use these a couple of times before I toss em. (Cleaning blade after each use with alcohol)Leaves your skin SO soft!
5,Loved it
5,I'm an old lady and this is so easy to use on your face.  Removes hair around eye brows and on face quickly.  I use it once a week.
5,"I can’t believe I’ve gone my whole life without these. I use them for my face, legs, etc and I’m in love."
5,i like it
5,"I used to stick to Japanese brands for these stuff but this one is so good! It’s sharp yet protects skin, very handy for eyebrow trimming"
5,These WORK!! I’ve paid more for other brands that do nothing but irritate my skin. But these take off every single hair and also really scrapes the dead skin off. Amazing!!
5,I like how long it last and it works well
5,"Great product, Great price"
5,"Love exfoliating my skin with these, as well as getting rid of peach fuzz, or annoying darker hair on my face! They work great and they’re cheap :)"
5,"Good safety razor for dermaplaning. They have a guard on them to prevent accidental scrapes and cuts, they remove dead skin cells and peach fuzz, stimulates circulation in the face and makes one's skin look younger. The price is good also. I give this product 5 stars."
5,Loved it!
5,"I’m turning into an elder and with that—things change. I don’t know if it’s always been there, but I recently noticed a lot of peach fuzz on my cheeks. Thankfully blonde, I didn’t like it. This implement is perfect for gently removing the fuzz and tidying up my eyebrows."
5,I love those to get my eyebrows done
5,"Works great, easy to hold shames well."
5,Arrived on time and in good shape. Very affective with removing my peach fuzz on my face and neck.*Warning it will leave little cuts if not careful using it*I've always found Shick products to be the sharpest and most effective brand.My opinion of course!
5,Initially bought it for mustache/eyebrow area but i used it along my cheeks and sideburns to thin out the hair there and it worked great. be sure to replace when they turn rusty. Lasts around 6 weeks for each
5,Works great and I have sensitive skin and it has not caused me any problems
5,"I had never tried a women’s shaver before this, and I highly recommend this product!"
5,Good  product
5,"I didn’t even know things like this existed until I saw a Facebook ad for a $100+ fancy version. When I looked into reviews, I found these for $5. They are amazing!!! I have (had) light peach fuzz on my face forever … but no longer!!!!!! So easy to use, no pain, no problems, and the peach fuzz is gone! Id like to use this on my entire body :)."
5,Love this.  Works as advertised.  I love this and so does my skin.  If I miss a spot shaving this takes care of it in seconds.  Recommend 100%
5,Easy to use
5,These are better than what I can find at the store.I really like these. And I don’t have to do it everyday like I did with the other brands I used.
5,"These facial razors are great! I use on my entire face, sideburns, mustache and all! I always clean them with alcohol and thoroughly dry them after use. After the second use of each, however, I started to break out horribly over every area that I had used them. I would advise others to treat these razors as disposable, and you shouldn't have a problem. I am pretty hairy due to hormonal imbalance and I do my entire face about once every three weeks."
5,Works amazing!
5,Clean shave and easy to use
5,it took off alot but the top of it is really sharp like i was moving it off my face and it nicked my nose
5,This is an okay purchase. Make sure to dispose properly
5,"Compared these to a frequently-advertised brand; these Schick brand dermaplaning tools work MUCH better. They have a finer blade than the others I tried, which gave better, more manicured results. Highly recommend these."
5,They last they work good price
5,"this is a really good high quality razor and i’m so glad i finally bought it!i’ll definitely continue to use this instead of cheap throwaway razors, it’s the best razor i’ve ever bought. and it’s durable! i have accidentally dropped it from high off the shower shelf several times and it hasn’t broke. the blades etc do however always fly off into pieces but it is in no way broken so that’s a huge plus that it is hardy.it feels soooo smooth and comfortable and moisturizes great. it’s not the absolute closest shave possible but it gets the job done. i’ve also noticed the blade is lasting a long time and isn’t rusting so far, i haven’t had to replace the blade yet. battery also seems to last a long time.TRIMMER: this is the real winner here and what makes this razor so great and worth it. it’s completely waterproof and so convient to use in the shower. also very simple and easy to adjust and clean, but you definitely need to clean it out after every use. it doesn’t cause any irritation or discomfort at all, i think it would basically be impossible to cut yourself with it. it works really well and is plenty sharp, it’s pretty quick to finish up and be done.COMPLAINTS: only two and these are minor inconveniences. it is a bit too bulky to be comfortable to handle. i know there has to be room for the batteries and inner workings but i have very small hands and it is slightly hard to grip and maneuver for extend periods of time especially around the bikini area because of the needed angles. another small complaint is that it’s kinda loud? it’s not massively noisy but it’s enough to annoy you and be heard from another room.it’s excellent overall and i would definitely recommend this for anyone nervous of and/or first beginning to trim/shave their bikini area."
5,"I love how easy it was to use this to remove all the peach fuzz on my face. The little attachment for trimming your brows worked perfectly, no more tweezing for me! At first I was anxious that I'd nick myself, but it's literally impossible with these. So glad I made the investment, my face feels so smooth. It didn't really exfoliate though, just removed all the hair."
5,I used to wax my facial hair. Some facial hair I just gave up on because my skin was too sensitive to wax. I will never forget the scar I had between my eyes for a year from hot wax ripping a hole in my skin. This little shaver takes all my hair right off with the same quality as waxing! So easy to use. I'd never wax again.
5,"When I looked at these tools and read the reviews, I was a bit hesitant. Tell you what though, I'm sold! This is the most effective product I've ever used to tackle my 60yr old over abundance of fuzz on my face. Easy to use."
5,So smooth and easy to use
5,"I love using this product for a quick cleanup job.  I use it to remove peach fuzz and to shape my eyebrows when I don't have time to get them waxed.  Definitely, a must-have for all the ladies."
5,It worked VERY WELL to the point I accidently cut my eyebrow with 1 sec mistake.It works very well. Trust me. I got half of one brow gone in a blink...
5,"First time user and it was very easy to use, I didn't get any cut. Recommend to watch some tutorials before using it"
5,"I bought these awhile back and absolutely love them! They work so well, and it’s nearly effortless. I have a lot of peach fuzz and this keeps my face fuzz free. When it came time to replace them, I saw a different brand that also had great ratings but were cheaper. I’m certain those reviewers haven’t tried this brand because these work WAY better than the off brand that I used! Like wayyy better. Spend the little extra bit if you’re between these and another brand because these will not only work better, but they’ll last longer."
5,One came broken and snapped in half but Amazon immediately replaced the product for me. Works well and not too sharp
5,Easy to use. Great for all areas of the body. They don't go dull fast.
5,Sharp and well!
5,"These are the best facial razors I’ve tried. They are safe & easy to use. The value is amazing. I always will repurchase. I recommend shaving with these once every few weeks, sanitizing between use and disposing after 3 or so uses. I don’t break out with these as I have with other brands. 10/10 recommend."
5,I am a first time user and I was pleasantly surprised at how good these worked. I have sensitive skin and did not have a acne flair up after using. I recommend these to anyone. You just have to use about every two weeks.
5,Very easy to use! It does shave old skin off so you do need to lotion after. I love it though! I can get those pesky eyebrow hairs off that I hate plucking.
5,I have tried like ever tool like this (dermaflash and all the cheaper alternatives) and this by far gives me the smoothest skin the fastest. Its easy to maneuver and you can use it more than once without it being render completely useless. Highly recommend
5,What an awesome alternative to waxing and plucking. Quick easy and you get good at it! Forever my go to.
5,These work great! Good for shaping brows or taking peach fuss off face.
5,I like these brow razors.  They get the job done and I will definitely re-order them.
5,Gets the job done better than the small rinky dink one.
5,This razors are amazing! Perfectly sharp and they get the job done!
5,"A fantastic product...easy to hold, reasonably priced, and it did the job - I'm able to clean up my eyebrows in no time. I plan on purchasing more of these."
5,Get these now if you are over 40! Lol no joke. I can’t use chemical peelers or exfoliants because my skin is so sensitive. These give you that fresh skin without the burn.
5,I got these to clean up the stuff I missed shaving my legs
5,Super easy to use and faster!! No roughness or swollen skin after using it. Easy to shape eye brows and shave face.
5,"After using nair on my face and waxing strips, they tend to still leave hair behind. This worked GREAT at getting all those fine hairs that get left behind. I was shocked at how much it took off my face. It did not scratch my face and I have very sensitive skin. I Highly recommend it."
5,They easily remove eyebrow hairs and peach fuzz. You won't hurt yourself as long as you are careful.
5,Easy to use and gets the job done.
5,Work great!!  Love the precision they provide and the close clean cut.  I use them for the fuzz on my eyelid and about my mouth.
5,Best razors for women's face that I’ve found. Highly recommend!
5,"I ditched all of my other ""lady 'stash"" products.  This is so easy to use and travels well. No more plucking or clown face burns or rashes from waxes. Make the switch."
5,I use these for eye brows and chin hairs and there awesomeSo many to choose fromBut this brand is goodThere sharp and easy to use
5,Easy to cut hair and leave area so clean highly recommended
5,"So, the first time I used this I was not paying attention and might have drawn a tiny bit of blood (sadly no Bill or Eric in sight). My bad. I am one of the most impatient people I know. Anyway, paying attention and slowing my roll, these work great. Removing those fine hairs off of the face really help the overall appearance of my skin and help it look smoother. GREAT ITEM."
5,Love these. Smooth. If used correctly they’re great. Any negative reviews about these I feel is lack of knowledge on dermaplaning
5,Easy to clean up peach fuzz & make up goes on better.
5,These work so great. They are (obviously) SO sharp. I wished they lasted a little longer!
5,I get dermaplaned professionally on a regular basis but some times we have a unexpected dinner out with friends and this is perfect for the in between appointments! It has a safety guard so you can’t cut yourself which is a plus for me!
5,"Easy to use. Good product, works well"
5,I have bought these a few times. I’ve also recommended them to friends. They work well. You can probably get 4 to 5 uses out of each blade if you’re using it to shave the peach fuzz off of your face and they don’t scratch your skin.
5,They don't seem to be different from any others I've used. They are sharp and work great
5,Love these.
5,"I just started ""planing"" my face with razors, and am using the ""As Seen on TV"" light hair remover, which is serrated, so now I have a chin full of scratches! I did try one last night with some oil on my face and they were very smooth and worked well. From what I understand, you're not supposed to do this daily, so I'll use them once a week to be safe. The bubble package was nice and they were at my house in 2 days. Thank you!"
5,So easy and simple to use. So great for my skin!
5,"Ordered these and absolutely love them!  Was going monthly to the spa for facial hair removal, but don’t need to any more.  Super reasonable price and easy to use!"
5,"I switched from plucking a few random hairs on my chin to swiping this quickly over the area. It takes the ""whiskers"" along with some peach fuzz easily and it is so smooth. My dermatologist said it is great exfoliation too."
5,"I have the world's most sensitive, 60-plus year old skin. This well great IF you hold it very lightly, barely whisping over the surface of the skin. The burns shown in product review photos are the result of too much pressure in use. Don't apply the same pressure as with a razor. 100% pleased with the product."
5,"I’m honestly about the last person to want to try something fancy. But, when the wife of a NASCAR driver talked about “dermaplaning” and even had a how-to tutorial, I decided to give it a try.When searching for the blades she’d shown in her video, I came upon these ones. They were reasonably priced, and I do use a Schick Hydro razor. So, I got them and some witch hazel (which is what she recommended to “prep” the skin).I felt two things when I got these: anxiousness and excitement.And, like most, I worried about having beard face. But, I decided to press on. I did use them the night I got them (about 2 weeks ago).Okay, here’s the deal – these are not a razor. They have a sharp blade, but they are NOTHING like a razor. Technically, I didn’t “shave” my face, but “skimmed” the surface thus removing a ton of peach fuzz. My face HAS NEVER been smoother. And, it was as easy as she stated – thank you S.B!!I “dermaplaned” before my shower, washed my face (Honest), used the Honest hydrating mist, and my avocado facial cream (More) – my facial didn’t “glow”, but it certainly felt SO MUCH better.There has been, even two weeks since doing it, no real emergence of hair – dark or otherwise. So, I do like that. This is going to be a new routine for me when I need it.I will state this – these do not work on the darker, coarser “goat” hairs under the chin. Thus either waxing, tweezing, or actual shaving might be necessary.I am definitely stocking up on these and they’re now part of my subscribe & save items."
5,These are great and easy to use!
5,Works well and seems to last longer than the electric facial hair removers for women.
5,Worked great and good value
5,I love these so much and they are so easy to use!
5,"My boyfriend had some crazy thic and messy eyebrows but once I used this product… one single line it took so much off and to the root!!! His eyebrows are looking amazing and also was very smooth while shaping!! Can’t explain how perfectly it worked not only on his but on mine! I have very sensitive skin, but as I was trimming and shaping mine. It was so soft and took every inch of hair I had off my face!!! I recommend this product strongly!!! Don’t wait!!!"
5,Easy to hold. Very sharp and easy to use. Would purchase again.
5,My favorite face razors they work amazing.
5,"I used to go to the salon monthly to get my upper lip waxed. The skin would be irritated after and grow back so quickly, not to mention $20 each time I went. Now I use these whenever I notice the hairs growing in. It’s super easy and my skin doesn’t get irritated anymore."
5,"Good material! Cut hair nicely. I have pretty sensitive skin with eczema, and it didn't irritate me at all."
5,Easy to hold and use. I have sensitive skin doesn't irritate.
5,Works great. Took all the peach fuzz off!
5,Easy and cheap
5,Havent even cut myself yet!!! Very easy to use.
5,Easier to use than tweezing and also can take peach fuzz off of your face
5,"As a woman ages, we get fuzz on our face. This works perfect for shaving"
5,Best decision you’ll ever make!
5,"easy to hold , easy to use , and pretty sharp so pls be careful when handling"
5,"Be careful, they’re sharp… good product!"
5,Love these! Perfect for touching up in between my eyebrow appointments and great for peach fuzz
5,These are the best ones I’ve used so far for derma planing. Just be careful at the tip because it’s rather sharp.
5,Love this so much! It helps sculpt my brows and get rid of my baby hairs.
5,Works great and easy to use
5,I wasn't expecting a whole lot but these worked pretty well. Better than the wire wrapped ones I tried in the past.
5,"NO PROBLEMS USING THIS, SHAVES SMOOTHLY AND EFFECTIVELY"
5,Easy to use. Very sharp (be careful)
5,I have super sensitive skin and this is the best razor I’ve found. It’s sharp enough that it gets all the dry skin and fuzz off my face but also not too sharp to where I cut myself. I recommend these razors to everyone because of how smooth my face is now!
5,I absolutely love these. They are nice and sharp so they don’t pull at the tiny hairs like some brands do.
5,One of the best things I’ve ever bought from Amazon!! I had NO IDEA how much peach fuzz/hair was on my face until I got these!! & My face was so smooth after! Buy it! You won’t regret it!
5,"These are very sharp, so be careful when using them on your face, but I’m very happy with these and now prefer these over the tinkle brand"
5,A great product to touch up your eyebrows. I only use this brand. I recommend this item.
5,Great for touch ups & close trims.
5,This works well for me with limited eyesight as I can't tweeze anymore.  I recommend this product
5,Easy to use and works well with sensitive skin. I also like the cap that goes with it.
5,Amazing. Be careful they are super sharp obviously but you definitely dont want to take off half an eye brow.
5,These are easy to hold and don’t cut if used properly
5,Best razors for shaping eyebrows ever!! I shopped around a lot for razors like these and these are by the far the sharpest most accurate razors. You go over the area once and the hair is gone! I love the plastic piece that allows you to be more accurate without cutting any hair you want to keep.
5,Simply the best. I’ll never buy another brand again.
5,"amazing for shaping eyebrows, very easy to use and absolutely worth the money."
5,"I love to use these for my face, so sharp and easy to use. I have not experienced any breakouts using these razors for dermaplaning."
5,These are far better than another brand I tried. They were easy to use and gentle on my skin.
5,"I love these durable/non-flimsy dermaplaning tools to touch up my beard because I prefer a clean-cut look. When using the tool, make sure to taut your skin and do gentle strokes in a downward motion. These are easy to travel with, and it comes with a cap to place on it so you can't really knick yourself with it. I wish a pack came with all blue ones for personal preference, but it is 2021 after all; there should be no such thing as gender-specific color options."
5,"These are super easy to use to clean up peach fuzz and fine hairs around the edges of my eyebrows. It is really easy to control and target exactly what hair I want to remove. My skin does feel a little rough afterwards, but I just wash and moisturize and it's back to normal."
5,"These are great, you don’t need the most popular or expensive tool! These work very well! Yes, as all of them….SHARP!"
5,I love it so much it takes off all my hairs from my face and eyebrows I love to use it with aloe oil 10/10🤩🤩
5,Amazing!! Easy to use. My skin is sooo smooth after. Love the cap you can place on it for when doing your eyebrows so you protect your eyelashes. I mainly use it for eye brows and upper lip. Wish I would have bought these sooner!!!
5,These worked great. It was my first time dermaplaning at home and I felt confident with these little razors. They're good quality and get a nice close shave. No complaints here for the price and quality!
5,Good product I use this for my wigs it’s nothing to special it’s just ur average razor comb
5,"I just started using this brand and I am already in love!! Great price for the quantity you receive, blades are super sharp and easily get the job done, and the shape of the handle makes it easy to shave the hard places."
5,Really good product and super easy to use
5,"Easy to use, this was definitely a blessing for my sensitive skin. I’d buy this again!"
5,"As a slightly fuzzier lady, these are godly! I use them on my face and arms and they erase the hair as if I never had any there. I've only nicked myself a few times but mainly because I wasn't holding them right, super easy to use!10/10 will buy again!"
5,"These work great for exfoliation and removing hair from face. The size is good too if you're using it for your face, I use the smaller ones for my eyebrows."
5,"- easy to use- be gentle if you are using on skin with acne, cuts, scarring, or sensitivity- a good, gentle face razor- try to shave downwards when using, works great!"
5,"Successful in helping to shave down my husbands beard as it grows in, and mine too. Oh, also use on my eyebrows and baby goatee hairs."
5,I use this product mostly to remove peach fuzz and my side burns and it works great for me! I've reordered once and I'll probably continue to use this product going forward
5,"One you use these, your makeup goes on smoother and looks better. I use on my entire face"
5,"They were sharp, so be careful when using. Easy to use"
5,pretty self explanatory.
5,I’m shocked at how well this works on fine facial hair! I’ve paid a lot of money for fancy gadgets that come with monthly subscription plans for replacement blades and this cheap fix blows them out of the water. A must have for easy grooming!!!
5,I love these they’re perfect for sensitive skin
5,These are so perfect
5,"Easy to hold,  easy to use. That razor is sharp. Be careful! But gets the job done!"
5,Love these for getting the fine baby hairs on my face.
5,"Thank you, love the produce. It came quickly."
5,This by far my favorite brand.
5,"I bought these well because they're cute 🤣. I actually used one on my cats that had matted fur, worked great and was quick so he wasn't so irritated with me messing with his fur!"
5,Easy to use and sharp! Perfect for cleaning up my brows
5,"I was debating buying these for quite a while, but finally grabbed them when I saw a really great deal. I’m glad I did! I was afraid that I’d cut myself up, but these things are kind of serrated in a way that the sharp parts are perpendicular to the actual edge. It’s a fail-safe for the extra clumsy (like me). I use them everyday and have even tidied up my kids’ brows with no injuries yet. So far I’m still using my first one, but it’s nice that they come in a multi-pack now that my beauty routine can’t survive without them."
5,Gentle on my sensitive skin. Removes my hair without leaving stubble! This is fantastic. Done with twinkle and other products.
5,Wish I would have known about this years ago.  I've always had long blond and peach fuzz hairs that glow in the sun.  So embarrassing.  This takes care of it no prob!
5,My favorite razors yet
5,These are fantastic! It gets rid of the peach fuzz without irritating my skin. And they are a three pack. They will last me for awhile. Highly recommended.
5,I saw these on TikTok and was skeptical but they work so well. I use them for any facial peach fuzz and to shape my eyebrows and they're perfect.
5,Easy to use and hold.
5,These are super easy to use and work great. After a while they do get dull but the price is so cheap it doesn’t hurt to buy more!
5,Worth it
5,Where have these been my whole life . These are amazing and so easy to use. I got rid of peach fuzz I never knew I had . Ha ha .
5,:-)
5,It’s such easy to hard and great for my sensitive skin! I was honestly really hesitant to shave my face with this but it doesn’t make my hair come back any darker and it saves off all the dry skin! You have to be really careful so you don’t cut your face but it’s easy to get the hang of
5,I absolutely love the razors for getting rid of small fine hair. It also leaves my skin feeling very soft. I'll def keep using it in the regular
5,Great for getting all those extra hairs!!
5,These are the best razors ever. Seriously don’t hesitate to buy!
5,I love amazing
5,the work so well. i use them to get dirt and peach fuzz off of my face
5,This is my first time dermaplaning  and I just went super slow and moisturized a lot. I had zero issues!
5,"This is the tool of tools. All that ever was, and all that ever will be. I bought this 3-pack impulsively, and did not brace myself for the magnificence of the results. The gunk that came off my face was insane. During the process, I literally watched my face change, it was like an unrealistic infomercial that comes on at 2am. Do yourself a favor, and buy these dermoplaners. I will never need to exfoliate with anything else ever again, I’m pretty certain."
5,I love these!! I definitely recommend them!
5,"No more threading for me!  A terrific product.  I recommend watching a couple YouTube videos on how to use.  A light touch, short strokes,  and proper angle is essential, but only needs a bit of practice."
5,"I use these for at-home dermaplane between my appointments. You don’t get as good of a dermaplane as at the aesthetic office, but it’s good enough between visits! Also great alternative if you have mustache hair — use this instead of waxing, which would irritate my skin."
5,Great product! My teenage daughter loves them.
5,"I just started shaving my face after hearing that makeup looks better if you get rid of the peach fuzz. Wow. It’s true!  These little blades are small enough to use between brows, over lip line, etc, and the do a great job of exfoliating. I shave my face once per week. My foundation looks way better since I’ve been using them."
5,Wow! Who knew? Use this and you will instantly look ten years younger! This is a very cheap and easy way to improve the look and feel of your skin. It’s non irritating and easy to manipulate. I’m sold on these! It also improves the look and finish of your makeup.
5,"I had been considering trying a facial razor for an at home ""dermaplaning"" experience. Glad I went with this product! Super easy to use! Not sharp enough to accidentally nick yourself, but sharp enough to effectively remove that peach fuzz and exfoliate. Also comes with a guard to do eyebrows, which is super helpful. Honestly, I can't get enough of it"
5,"I'm pretty happy that it works well. Now I can quit using a body razor on my face LOL. If you can't always make a trip to the salon, this product is amazing! I use it weekly, and fun fact... It helps my make-up go on more smoothly! Huge plus there too."
5,The improved version is much more efficient
5,Very convenient easy to just grab those stragglers when you’re moving through life I keep it in my purse.  No woman likes hair on her face. I also bought one for an elderly family member and it’s worked out more convenient than ever to keep her well groomed.
5,I was hesitant to order this product but so glad I did. I should've ordered it a long time ago. Super easy to use and painless hair removal. It completely rids my face of the small white peach fuzz and my white hair lady stash. I absolutely love it!
5,Works great!
5,Love this shaver. Hate razors but gotta get rid of mustache and chin hairs!!! Works great for me. They last around three years. This is my second one. The colors are really pretty too!!!
5,Very easy to use.
5,I love this product! I don't normally write reviews but when I do..  I do it because I seriously LOVE the product. This product is easy to use and for my sensitive skin it works wonders. I was a bit nervous to purchase this product but I am sooooo glad I did!! I used it for my peach fuzz and for my eyebrows and it worked wonders!!! Sooooo much better than just the razor method or the nair. Save money and save your skin! Use flawless!!!!
5,Being able to buy new heads has been a game changer. Highly recommend
5,"Love this thing! Since I've had such a positive experience, I just ordered the Flawless device for brows as well. I have fair, sensitive skin and have had zero issues or irritation with this. I don't even know how it's possible for someone to injure themselves. It's the easiest thing ever. I've also found that the hair doesn't grow back quickly, the way it did after using those dermaplaning razors. In fact, I've only needed to use it once time in the last 9 days since receiving it. Before, it felt like I had to do maintenance every couple of days. (I also developed a really bad cyst once after using those, due to an ingrown hair.) This device is soooo much better than those little razors in every way."
5,I am fairly hairy and I use it every couple of weeks.ProsSmall and very easy to carryLong battery lifeSo easy to useConvenientPainlessConsNone! Sad i didnt know about this product earlier!

5,Love this item as it is easy to use and does the job.  Only problem is the battery life is short.
5,Goodbye facial hair. Flawless is a game changer
5,"I bought this one because I’m allergic to a lot of products I’ve used to shave my face. And this facial remover is incredible!! It’s small but powerful and easy to use. I highly recommend it! If you’re scared to buy it, just give this a try because it’s affordable and it works great!"

5,"I am not overly hairy, but this product works great on those stubborn chin and jaw hairs!"
5,This is an amazing little tool!  Can’t believe I waited so long to buy one of these for my peach fuzz. Very easy to use and I feel that I look much younger!  Best $20 I’ve spent in a long time.
5,"Amazing, but only for face use! Do not try to remove your hair in other areas like ur vagina lol"
5,Drop whatever you’re doing an buy one of these for every person in your life. They are the best thing ever
5,This device removed hair easily & without complications

5,"I love this! Easy to use, small for traveling, and takes care of small unwanted facial hairs."

5,"It's easy on sensitive skin, the battery life is amazing, and it is compact."
5,It’s cute and really handy when u miss a spot on ur leg

5,"It is easy to use. However, battery life leaves something to be desired."
5,Usually pluck hairs. Would be unable to for a long time. This saved the day. Easy to use and does the job.
5,Very quick and easy to use. Comfortable. This is the second generation. Be sure to order the Gen2 refills as the first size will not fit or stay attached.
5,Make sure you clean it out between usages. It works well and I like the product.
5,"This is my first time of using a product like this.  After burning my face by using hot wax for hair removal (and what a mess!) I was so happy that this actually works, it's easy, and no mess!!!"
5,I recently lost my original and was literally panicked after going a week without it. Little chin whiskers were sneaking up and hoped my boyfriend didn’t notice me pulling them as he got out of the car. LOL Finally stopped searching for it and decided to order a replacement. Shaves even smoother than the first. Long battery life but now I may replace more often on this one to keep the smooth perfect cut. Worth every penny and small enough to toss in your bag and carry everywhere.
5,This works great!! I love this! The little light is helpful but it is amazing on its own! Highly recommend!
5,Works wonderfully.
5,Gave as gift to picky friend and she was thrilled.
5,"I have been given the genetic gift of unwanted facial hair (thank you mom) and have tried waxing, shaving, plucking, etc…This little device is the best facial hair remover I’ve ever used. Painless, quick and easy to use. I wash up, moisturize and buzz this thing across my chin and even the shortest fuzzies are gone in seconds. It’s also fun to use on toes and fingers. lolBuy it!"
5,Need top change different size items
5,"If your eyebrow hairs migrated down to your upper lip and your chin, this handy little device is a lifesaver. It painlessly removed those pesky hairs that haunt us and leave a your face nice and smooth. This mini shaver is the best one I’ve ever tried. Read the product insert to make sure you’re using it correctly and clean it after every use. I’m impressed!"
5,"I like this product. Because it small and easy to use. And it came with a battery. How smart, I thought about not having one great job."
5,Small enough to keep in your purse and easy to use! I bought it for my daughter who has super sensitive skin and she uses it without issue.
5,Works great. Good value for the money
5,"I love this tool and would 100% recommend to anyone. Previously I used a facial hair removal cream or got the occasional wax. This tool is quick and easy as well as gentle on my skin. Don't hesitate, do yourself a favor and get one!"
5,Love my little shaver! It works well. This is my 2nd purchase.
5,"Wow, I am so excited about this product. I've been using a ladies facial razor and/or trying to use tweezers for most of my adult life, and just found out about this product. It works perfectly and I can do a quick touch up in less than 5 seconds when it used to take several minutes, before. Also, it's so cute! It just looks like a lipstick, so I can carry it with me without feeling awkward. Absolutely love this."
5,This is my third time purchasing Flawless. The average lifespan of the previous two were about two years. I hope this one can last longer.
5,ThiS works well for the hair on my chin and neck didn't cause pain or irratation
5,Great product.

5,Love this and will purchase again. Easy to use and does the job at getting the peach fuzz off my face which getting rid of the peach fuzz makes my makeup go on so much more smoothly.
5,Works great upper lip!
5,I have always had unwanted facial hair since I was around 18. It is dark and mostly course.  I have tried everything except laser hair removal. After coming across this product in a blog I figured I’d give it a try. It leaves my lip and chin so smooth! I really do wish I would have found it sooner. I have sensitive skin and it didn’t bother my skin at all. I highly recommend!
5,I use for my lip easy and painless
5,Excellent I have to have this I cannot go without them I didn’t know all I had to do was order a different head so I ended up ordering a whole Nother one but now I have to
5,I like it a lot. Best invention. It’s smooth results
5,"This is the greatest product ever! It is super easy to use and does exactly what it's supposed to do - removes unwanted facial hair. I used to rely on the uncomfortable and painful ways of plucking or threading to remove the hair above my lip. No more of that since I purchased this lovely new tool. This battery operated tool causes no pain and no redness, and the hair is removed quickly without flaw. The light will help you find any hairs that you might miss. I really love this product and I've recommended it to my friends and co-workers. They also love it."

5,"I use this to remove the peach fuzz from the sides of my face.  It does not pull my hair, and does a good job.  The unit does not cause any irritation to my skin."
5,The item was delivered promptly and is a great little gadget
5,Omg it really works. Everyone should have one. Will definitely purchase again.
5,cleared all of the peach fuzz
5,"I loved close this worked without pain or irritation, but it just quit working after one battery swap out.You also need to replace the shaving heads periodically."
5,"Easy to  handle, works like  charm  removing my  old age facial hair"
5,"This works great and its small and easy to take along on vacation and such. Works well on my sensitive skin, no reactions. Beautiful color! This is my second Flawless and I recommend them to all my family and friends."

5,I absolutely love this little shaver! It works so well in removing all of the unwanted peach fuzz and stray hairs from my face without pulling or tugging. I have tried to use it under my eyebrow to clean up any strays there but it does seem to pull those hairs. It’s so compact and can be carried in your makeup bag and takes up no room in your purse. The little light is really bright and makes seeing the hair so much easier. So happy with my purchase!
5,It’s a great compact product for the money
5,love this product
5,I have one and wanted another to put in my camper because I loved the way it worked so much better than the one I was using.

5,I love Flawless Touch products. They work perfectly for me and each type does its job. No more plucking eyebrows or nicking my legs.  OH...and did I say how much I love Flawless Touch products?
5,"Great for lip hair, only product that does not hurt my 8 year old or me. Sometimes I just use vaseline after if my skin is a little irritated. Then fine after."

5,My daughter loves this for her face
5,I have purchased two before (from another provider) but they don’t last long. They break. This is my third. I hope it lasts because they are very useful
5,Perfect
5,Like it
5,This device is so easy to use.  It is a comfortable procedure. I am so glad that I purchased this device.
5,Does the job of removing fine hair that is to hard to see & tweeze. Bought this one as a gift.Love the bright color.
5,Works well.
5,"I can’t believe I didn’t know about this sooner. This is just freaking amazing. Used it on this chin hairs women don’t talk about. My whiskers. Hell did my legs too to see how it went. Like I said, still in shock. Works great. Worth the money. I’d buy again and again"
5,So quick and easy to use! Works great.
5,Pretty case. Easy to carry and use
5,so easy to use for sensitive skin and my face feels super smooth
5,"Great compact product to keep for quick clean ups. Super easy to use, non abrasive and affordable."
5,Love this product. I wish I had this years ago! Perfect for people that are sensitive to waxing.
5,Bought my first one in 2018 and over time it’s gone bad . This one works so well. I just glide it over the area and it takes off the hair. It’s quick and painless!! I love it! So much better than waxing or threading !
5,Product does what it promises
5,This product is amazing and simple to use
5,A great device thats easy to use and even better easier on the skin! The Ms. Loves it.
5,I had bought a couple of these for my girls I got the purple and the mermaid ones and decided to get myself one. I got the blush one. I also have the flawless eyebrow one. I love it and how easy it is to use. The only thing is when mine arrived and I got it put together the battery that came with it doesn't work. Oh well not a huge deal i replaced it and it works great.
5,"Although it smells pretty bad, this stuff is great. I have really sensitive skin and this didn’t bother me at all. Yes, 😸 friendly, although not advertised that way"
5,"It smells like hair relaxer with lye. I only put it on for 4 minutes, wiped off with warm cloth and I was pleasantly surprised. I did underarms n pubic area, it turned out amazing.!"
5,ok so no one told me that it smells and that you can possibly get a chemical burn. i personally ended up being just fine and actually really really like the product but just wanted to add those warnings because no one who hyped it up online mentioned it at least that i saw lol. i honestly think i’ll be using this instead of shaving from now one. i used it on my arms legs armpits and downstairs snd it worked really well. i left it on for about 5 minutes then wiped it off with a wet washcloth. it smells way better than nair and unlike nair actually got off every single hair i put the shaving powder over. definitely need to wipe it off with a cloth to make sure it gets wiped off all the way just be gentle when removing to not irritate your skin and moisturize afterwards. i normally get itchy after shaving or the one time i used nair but i had no itchiness with this at all. baby lotion is one of the best things for your body’s skin in my opinion so is recommend using that after using this powder. i’ve never been so stoked about a product until now
5,"I didn’t expect for this to work as good as it did, I have sensitive skin and it didn’t both me one bit. Only bad thing about this product is the scent, it does have a stench to it but hey, as good as it works I can live with the shell"
5,So struggled with bikini area ingrowns and I seen this stuff on TikTok. Smells like nair but this stuff is magic. Applied a nice even layer only left it on for 7min. Don’t leave it on longer!!! You can burn your skin if your sensitive I would highly suggest the other kinds. But I love this stuff and makes my life so much easier
5,This product work so well my legs feel so soft. It got rid of the hair great. It comes with a stinky price. It's smells like ammonia and rotten eggs. It did stink up the whole house. I did see in several other reviews that it was bad but I was prepared for it. It does work well enough that I will still use it.. Next time I will do it outside or in the garage.
5,It did it's job but it's not for sensitive skin for sure and it smells like relaxer when mixed with water. It was everything I expected it to be. I will definitely keep using it because it did what it was supposed to.
5,It most definitely done the job!!!!! Smell isn’t pleasant so I’d advise you to be prepared to bathe afterwards
5,I seen it on tiktok so I recommend
5,"Loved the results just let sit on and wipe away with a cloth hair is gone skins so smooth, have some ventilation it stinks pretty bad but smell doesn’t linger after rinse off. Def buying again"
5,"It was actually pretty decent. I’m the type of hair grower where it seems like I shave and by night time I have stubble back. This was a pretty okay alternative for shaving. I say this because nair doesn’t work for me, but this actually wiped the hair away. Do use a warm rag when wiping hair and product off, I found that to be nose efficient. However, I don’t know if it’s worth the smell… A friend of mine swears by it though. She was smooth for a week, I was smooth for about a day or two. I think I’ll stick to waxing my legs… as painful as it is. Not too bad if your in a time pinch or out of wax. Also, I do not have sensitive skin, so I won’t speak to that… just don’t leave it on for longer than 7-8 minutes and I think you will be fine. Just try it, not expensive, and might work really well for you. The same friend said she’s never going back to shaving. The odor is strong, reminded me of nair, so might want to open a window… I showered afterwards so the smell wasn’t engrained into my pores."
5,My legs are so smooth and soft. This is amazing . The smell on the other hand is horrible.
5,"Aside from the God awful smell, this thing worked WONDERS on my arms. My arms were pretty hairy, not too terrible but I was pretty self conscious. After using this and withstanding what smelled like rotten eggs, my arms came out completely smooth and void of any hair. It was my first time using it so I missed a couple spots, but when it grew back I had about 2-3 weeks with hardly any hair and now that it's growing back, it's def not as thick as it was and the grow back process is not at all itchy."
5,The scent is very strong
5,"It smells awful yes, but it helps not having to shave so much. I used it 1-2 weeks ago and my skin is still pretty soft but slowly growing in. And I always struggled with my hair growing back so quick on my body. No ingrown hairs with it yet."
5,This is awesome! Only bad thing is it smells like rotten eggs/ sulfur. I used on my husbands back and it works amazing! I’m gonna try on my legs but i will definitely be doing this outside because of the smell
5,On my sensitive skin it works well it’s been 48 hours and I have no complaints but the smell is strong and terrible🤮
5,"I wouldn’t recommend for sensitive skin, but definitely works!"
5,Scent was really strong. Highly suggest a well ventilated area when using this product. Leaves your skin smooth and a bit lighter.
5,"I have really thick and coarse hair all over my body so when I shave it’s razor bump city no matter how much I exfoliate, moisturize, and take every precaution to prevent them. I used this on my legs and lower body even tho you aren’t tech suppose too. And I’m really impressed with the results. It got 95% of the hair off my legs in one sitting. It didn’t burn or irritate my skin which is amazing. I would suggest this over nair and shaving any day. The only down side is that it is a bit messy so I would try to do it in the bathtub or bathroom and it has a slight odor of rotten eggs but is isn’t as bad as everyone says it is. Unless you’re super sensitive to smells."
5,"The smell isn’t that great but I can get over that, works like “magic” ;)))))"
5,"Bought this after I saw a tiktok video and had to get it , I love it it works great has me smooth and bald. The smell is strong but not that bad"
5,"I like everything in this product,"
5,"This product is interesting, I found through TikTok and decided to give it go. Definitely make it a cleaner smooth shave when using for any area. The only major con to this product is the horrible smell. But I do recommend if you think you’d bare the stench lol."
5,i bought this because i have sensitive skin and prone to strawberry legs but it works so well and the price is right.
5,"Smells like stinky eggs but not as bad as other brands that smell like it’s burning. My skin reacted really well to it (arm pits, legs, arms and the V area) now everyone’s skin is different so definitely do a test before you do the sensitive spots. And I did stay very smooth and silky for about 2 weeks (will start staying longer the more you use)"
5,"This is THE best, not to mention the cheapest stuff to use on any part of your body that you want to remove unwanted hair! Forget waxing, shaving, or electrolysis-this product is what you need. It doesn’t smell the greatest(think Nair) but the results make it worth it."
5,"I’m a girl and love using this product! I’ve used it in pretty much all areas and have not had issues with it sensitivity wise. It does smell very bad so make sure to do it outside, or else your house will smell like rotten eggs for quite some time."
5,It stinks terribly but it works great on legs AND bikini area.
5,I have to say I am very impressed with this product! Works amazingly well! It does have an order once water is applied but totally worth it for the results!
5,"Saw it on tik tok and order it right away but of course sold out and had to wait weeks to get one. Worth the wait because it works so good on wet skin, wait for it to dry white and wipe off with wet $1 exfoliate gloves. I use it on all parts of my body. Last for a week and love the results no burn!!!! Smell is bad so use air freshener or candle."
5,Smell was horrible but really easy to use. And made my skin smooth
5,"Works excellently, after wiping the hair off I was quite surprised to see it worked to the extent that it did. My only complaint is that when I got the package the lid was off on the can and I had to funnel the powder from the shipping package into a plastic bag."
5,"Absolutely amazing. I use to have dark armpits and few razor bumps, after ONE use I can see the bumps clearing and my skin goin back to its natural color. Love this"
5,"I’m a, well, hairy woman. It happens, it’s genetics, been dealing with facial hair since I was a teen.  Same with my legs.  Nair always failed me. It would remove about half the hair I applied it to. So I shave. Well. Saw this product mentioned in a mom group I’m in.  It was cheap enough to try without a big loss if it didn’t work.  I used it on my face first. Took care of the stache and all of the beard except some grays with one application. Next was my legs. Total success.  I also find the hair isn’t growing back as quick as when I shave.If you are a hairy female I highly recommend you try this once"
5,Works amazing!! probably won’t ever shave again!! Even works for your downstairs area! I definitely recommend.
5,This stuff is amazing. Smell horrible but does an amazing job. Left my skin soft and hair free. But they did go up in price which is sad. But I love this!
5,"It work perfectly, and fast too. I didn't have to use it a second time."
5,It was great! It removed all the hair and no issues with my skin. My skin can be sensitive and I was afraid to used it but it worked great!
5,"This product works very well! I was expecting the type of burn that happens with other depilatory products but it was surprisingly mild on the skin and removed all of the hair covered by the paste completely! The smell is exactly like sulfur, but it works so well that I will probably continue using it despite that."
5,Take off your jewelry or it will tarnish it.  But product works well
5,This product works well for those who don't take well to razors or who have skin-sensitive issues with them.
5,Awesome on my sensitive skin. Its very moisturizing and leaves my skin feeling amazing even after a couple of days. I will definitely be buying more
5,This product right here is something else. Yes it does smell terrible but that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t get it. I was skeptical about because of the smell but I got it and it amazed me. It took all the hair off my body. It was amazing. I love it.
5,"I bought this based on a review I saw with the reviewer essentially giving a raving review of the product. I figured for 3 bucks, it was worth a shot. This product works the best on longer hair, so if you plan on using this on leg hair, the longer you didn't save the better. Think along the lines of at least 1 week of fast leg hair growth, preferably longer times between for the best results. There wasn't a fragrance added to the product. The only signs of irritation to my really sensitive skin were from previous irritated spots that were caused from the last time I shaved."
5,Best thing ever!!!! Especially since its summer and i live in florida
5,I've been an avid Nair user for years but it either didn't get all the hair off or always almost burnt my neither region but this stuff is AMAZING. I tried it as soon as I got it and I'm as smooth as a baby. The smell is def not pleasant but totally worth it for how well this stuff works.
5,"This product gives me a razor-close shave and slows downthe growth of hair on my face. However, it does smell like rotten eggs."
5,"I got the extra strength, and it’s so easy to use. Yes, it smells terrible but if you READ THE INSTRUCTIONS (*cough cough* i don’t think some people in these reviews did) and leave it on for 7-9 mins (i know this is a bit longer than recommended, i have really thick hair). I safely use it on my pubic area (careful to not get it on the inside ladies). I used to get horrible razor burn, but with this everything is so smooth! Keep it wet with a spray bottle of water. Wipe it off after 7 mins and the messy cleanup afterwards is worth it!"
5,Works perfectly kinda smells tho
5,"Wow! Bought this after seeing it on Tik tok! I used it for my bikini area. No matter what products I’ve used, I always get razor burn. This definitely did not give me any...but it also didn’t completely remove the hair. There are stir stubles."
5,"This stuff is amazing, it does stink like nair but it works great. Left my arms and stomach smooth like a baby ass! I will totally recommend!"
5,"Stings a little bit if I leave it on too long, and there was some temporary redness, but overall it worked great! I have used it on my chest, stomach, and even south of the belt line with no major problems. The smell really is bad, but that's just the cost of hair removal with this product."
5,it works great even on womens legs
5,Works great!!
5,"I was a little skeptical about how well this product would actually work, I've seen so many people talk about it and how it works really fast or how it basically melts away the hair. But I finally caved in and tried it and I have to say I'm seriously impressed. I have incredibly thick and coarse hair and it took it away with ease. Plus it doesn't burn or smell like most razorless shaving products do. In my opinion it's well worth every penny"
5,I love it it is good but the only bad thing is the smell do it in a well ventilated area it does have a strong smell almost like eggs when you had water and stuff but when you open it it smells like bleach. I would recommend this
5,"Female here. I purchased this product to test out for unintended purposes. Use at your own risk in this manner- but as a female I've rried razors, nair, etc. While razors tend to do the job I need, they never leave me smooth and I always end up with razor bumps no matter how much shave cream, lotion, or brand new of a razor I use. I also tend to have sensative skin and nair almost always burns me or leaves me with a rash.  I'd given up on my dreams of being as smooth as a naked mole rat, until I discovered this product.Initially i tried the regular strength, which works excellent for my facial fuzzes, and (again not intended for these uses) arms and underarms.I then purchased extra strength to see if it was strong enough to tackle my industrial hairs on other unspoken body parts. I proceeded at my own risk according to the warnings and instructions advising against this obviously. And did a test section.To my wonder!! I was was left with absolutely no stubble! No reddness or rashing, bumps or chemical burns! Instead I was silky smooth and my dreams came true in that moment.Good bye razors. Good bye expensive, ineffective nair!!I only wonder where this product had been all my life.As a woman, if this product can take tackle my hair strength, I have no doubts it would work excellent on some industrial strength facial hairs for men as intended.Absolutely love."
5,"Great as a hair removal product. Smells, but in the land of hair removal...whatever it takes."
5,It is very easy to use. Just mix the powder and water. It does have a little bit of smell.
5,Product must be fresh. Carefully follow the instructions.
5,"Regardless if it’s extra strength or regular: once mixed with water, this stuff smells like dog fart! Wet green farts! But it WORKS! I love how it removed my LEG hairs. Kinda chips like sawdust when it’s dried and leaves a dusty mess upon removal so I recommended washing off near a drain. Idk about sensitive skin I haven’t used on pits yet."
5,"The fastest way to get smooth, hair free legs."
5,"Thought I would give it a try...as soon as the weather warms up, too get rid of the face fur"
5,works amazing! smells terrible but my hair didn’t grow back for weeks!
5,"I give it 5 overall becausebit does what it says,removes the hair BUT i MUST add that im a white female, this clearly states for african american men so take a few minutes off the time to leave it on if u have sensitive skin or are caucasian, not being racist but with this being meant for thick coarse african american hair i figured id let yall know,i love it though ive order 2 more since buying this 1,but 2-4 mins tops"
5,"I’m so glad I tried this! Cheap, accessible, and EFFECTIVE! I hate shaving, always get razor burn and bumps. I pulled the trigger on this powder and did my calves, thighs, and bikini line. Everything is smooth and hairless! I followed instructions to a T and heavily moisturized after with a beeswax and coconut oil cream. 10/10 would recommend and will buy again."
5,"I am so happy I found this product, it’s the only thing that works for my very course hair. Even when I shave, there’s keratosis Pilaris bumps. This has improved my KP and no ingrowns. Never shaving again. There is a technique though, you need to have a spray bottle, and keep it wet, DO NOT let it dry otherwise it won’t work. Also, scrape it off, don’t just wash it off. Otherwise it’s great"
5,I genuinely loved this product it works wonders BUT HOLY GOD does it smell rancid.
5,"I have very thick hair, I’m tired of shaving and I’ve been meaning to try something different than Nair I could have that on my skin for 10 min and it will still leave a lot of hair behind. I tried this and I left it on for seven minutes and it took all my hair out completely I’m very satisfied with this I’m certainly going to keep buying this. I got to say it’s a little messy but it’s worth it."
5,It is super gentle unlike Nair or veet..or waxing. This is the best product ever.. except the smell. Imagine..if you will.. the smell of hot trash..then add in rotten eggs.. and a pinch of death. That smell that makes your mouth and eyes water in the worst way.. that feeling like you're going to vomit..still smells better than this stuff..if you can get passed the smell.. you'll have an amazing product. my hair stayed away for at least 3 weeks..probably terrified of the smell again 😂
5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! Besides the fact it smells like a place where eggs come to rot, it's amazing, especially if you have sensitive skin or if you're just prone to constantly injuring yourself with a razor (like me)"
5,I honestly didn't think it would work. I took a leap of faith on this. I followed full instructions. To my surprise it got the job done. It's been a few days and there's no chaffing. No ingrow. No irritation. It's like it regulated the hair after I shaved and used this. The hair is growing back and it's not prickly. I would 10/10 recommend if you have thick hair and hate how after shaving it feels like a cactus. This is for you.
5,Worked great for hair removal
5,Very easy to use but the stench is intense. It doesn't irritate skin and comes off easily.
5,My daughter told me about this stuff. She was right. Hair on the nether regions came off like magic. Less than 5 minutes.
5,"Despite the REALLY bad smell, I love it. It doesn’t give my sensitive skin razor burn and it actually takes ALL the hair off. I will be buying again."
5,"You know why your here.... tiktok! Let me say: but this, but it now!!!! Maybe get the “fragrant” one that only a dollar something... cause the extra strength does smell like rotten eggs.... but my gawd does this work. Picture is deceiving, small than you’re thinking, but for $3.00, an “okay” size. Maybe get a few and keep the rest when you need it later. I did my legs and armpit and got wonderful results..... OH ALSO get the silicone mask applicators, you know, the pick and blue paint brush looking things! That’s what I used to apply the cream to my legs and armpits!"
5,Absolutely love this product I will never shave again. All though the odor is strong it's not as bad as other products out there.
5,This works so good! Great for the price
5,"I have been shaving my legs for years, but razors are expensive and I get horrible in grown hairs often even with fresh ones because of my sensitive skin. I was leery to try this product because of my sensitive skin, but I tried it anyways. I used it on both my upper and lower legs. There was no burning or irritation. I left it on for five minutes (it says 5-7, but again I was leery) and it removed nearly all my leg hair. I'm certain that if I would have done the full seven minutes, it would have gotten it all. I would definitely recommend. However, make sure you have a candle burning or the fan on, because the stuff smells very chemically and my nose was not a huge fan."
5,Super easy use.
5,I have severe allergies to most products but not to this one. Although it smells of rotten eggs it works great once you find the right consistency
5,"Okay so I saw this on tic-toc and thought why not give it a try. BUY IT! I have very sensitive skin and always get ingrown hairs and razor bumps. This is really magic. No bumps, no irritation. (The smell is terrible so don’t use right before having a guest over it stinks up the house) but I honestly don’t care it works so well. I have used it for all over hair removal. One caution- if using on arm pits don’t put deodorant on right after it will burn, but if you wait an hour or so it’s fine."
5,"Water based, works well for acne prone skin"
5,"This feels great on my skin! Silky smooth on my skin and once it’s absorbed I can’t feel it at all. I use it first thing in the morning, every morning! I have sensitive skin and I haven’t had any issues. I will 100% be buying this again."
5,Good Product. I continued and bought second time.
5,"I like this moisturizer, I use this when my skin feels particularly dry. It feels so nice and cool going on, and absorbs quickly. And strangely enough, it seems to smooth out some of my wrinkles just a bit. Yes I would recommend this to a friend."
5,This goes on my face super smooth. I love this moisturizer very much! it's inexpensive and works great!
5,It’s been the missing piece. I use retin A and get peels so this is a nice balancing moisturizer .
5,"Super hydrating, with no greasiness, melts into the skin leaving a refreshed feeling. The scent is amazing too. Love it"
5,"Love the feel, the way it moisturizes, especially with my extremely sensitive skin."
5,Like everything about this moisturizer.
5,This is a quality product and fulfills exactly as advertised.  I wouldn't use anything else.
5,Everyone should get this moisturizer. Highly recommend this product.
5,This is the best hydrating cream I’ve used over my 60 years. I’ve had jars that cost $100’s so imagine my surprise to find a $20 miracle cream!
5,Love the moisturizer
5,"Not oily, my skin feels happy and soft!"
5,I love this product! It leaves my skin hydrated and not oily. I used it everyday with other skin product from the same line. Its affordable and been using the product for several months. My skin is sensitive but this product leave my face smooth and when I applied my make up it looks good. I used it on my face and neck. It feel fresh and cool on my skin.
5,"No scent, works great all day"
5,Product is used for my face good for sensitiveSkin . Scent is very light not overbaring.
5,"This really locks in the moisture! Visible softening of wrinkles. I put it on after a shower when my face is damp.  In the evening, I wet my face and apply it for a second time for the day. I will definitely be ordering this again."
5,"I love the product, but not the price !!"
5,Love this. It doesn't make the skin oily
5,Best moisturizer I purchased in past 5 years! Leaves your skin hydrated n velvety n even has a nice refreshing smell..I’m on my third one! Absolutely loveee it
5,"I always meant to put moisturizer on my face at night before bed but never did, until I found this.  I use it every night and I love the way it makes my face feel.  And it dries so quickly, not sticky or tacky.  I have tried almost every moisturizer made and this by far is the best.  I will use this moisturizer for the rest of my life, will never waste my money again on anything else."
5,I love this so much that I use it all over especially on my eczema. I'm buying more today.
5,I really love this product. You only need just a little as its very thick. It does not feel thick on your face though. It goes on VERY smooth and leaves your face and neck very moisturized! It also gives you a glow! Even though its a night cream I use it in the day as well and my face looks really good and feels good.There is no heavy product feeling.
5,"Started using this product a month ago in combination with the hydro boost face wash and this week i have gotten 3 seperate compliments- 2 in person and one over facetime! can't believe people can see the difference, but can't deny 3 shout outs! never going to stop using this now!!"
5,"So lightweight, no scent . refreshing and feels lovely ."
5,Love it it feels great on your face
5,Just feels good. Not sure what else its supposed to do...
5,This is probably my favorite thing I’ve ever gotten for myself! It’s sooo hydrating! When I read the reviews I read that it was like giving your face a drink of water that is the best description! My husband and I both love this stuff!
5,"I have combo skin that can be sensitive during certain times of the year. This is the only moisturizer that works for me! And I’ve tried SO MANY. It’s light, no over powering scent, and feels amazing on my skin. Brings it to life and stays moisturized all day. I highly recommend’"
5,Nice moisturizer.  It’s light and smooth and does not leave any sticky feeling after it’s applied.
5,They are very good products
5,This is so moisturizing and makes my skin feels great. It doesn't go on too thick either (I have blemish-prone skin). The scent is very pleasant as well.
5,"I read the reviews and the product is a good buy. I’m not sure how it moisturizes but it does seem to plump the face up with what I assume is moisture. It is not greasy and there is not a residue. My pores clog easily so I didn’t place around my eyes. Also, a little goes a long way."
5,It is a great product for hydrating my face! It has a very light soft scent! I even put under my eyes with no problems!I wore my makeup over it and I love it!
5,"From the first time I used this product, I saw immediate results! My skin was visibly smoother, softer, and moisturized. I'm amazed and would recommend this product to any and all who are looking for immediate results."
5,"After having gone through so many moisturisers, I've finally found a moisturiser that is just perfect. It's moisturising but not oily, light but not drying and absolutely refreshing :)"
5,I love this gel! It does what it says and works better than any moisterizing cream I have ever used. This gel helos moisture soak right into your face. Slather it in & wait a minute. It goes right in and your face feels so much better.
5,"I had used the Neutrogena hydroboost years ago, and for some reason had switched to other products. Started using it again a week ago and now I remember why I loved it so much! It feels so good when I put it on, cool and has a dreamy texture."
5,I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer! It keeps my skin hydrated all day and it definitely smooths my skin and got rid of fine lines!!!! I just wish it came with more ❤️❤️❤️❤️
5,"Moisturizing,  soaks into skin and feels great! No greasy feeling. My daughter uses it on her sensitive skin with no problem."
5,"Love, love, love this moisturizer!"
5,Good product it made me break out a little otherwise good product
5,"I like this gel cream for use in summer, as it’s very light and cooling.  It is moisturizing but may not be enough in hit, dry climates."
5,"The product does what it says it will do, The result is dependable, consistent, and beautiful."
5,This moisturizer really checked all the boxes for me. I sometimes get dry patches and this really solved that issue. The best part is that it gives you a nice glow
5,"I love this product!  I have always had oily skin ( even in my 50s), so I don’t want something oily, but need moisture-especially on certain patches.  This stuff smells so good, so light, and soaks into my skin, foundation goes on smooth, patches are smoothed."
5,"amazing quality, so lightweight, feels great on the skin"
5,I used this product because a dermatologist recommended to me as a cheap option for moisturizer and I highly recommended
5,I use it everyday before my moisturizer and it gives my skin such a boost.
5,I love this hydrating cream.  It feels so great everytime I apply it.  I have very dry skin.  I started using it on my face but now I use it on my arms which are crepey and always dry. It’s a great pick me up!!!
5,"This is Amazing!!! Great for sensitive skin, moisturizing!!! Wonderful for Aging Skin!!!"
5,This is my second jar. I love this. Very ligh. Feels refreshing. Great soft scent
5,"WOW, talk about a discovery!  I'm in a cycle of mixed dry or oily facial skin where my face feels tight after washing, which causes overproduction of oil or whatever it is the body produces to try to correct itself but it's out of whack. I've researched it and bottom line seems to be that I need a moisturizer but not an oil-based one. On quite a number of websites, including ones that are not just basic generalized fluff info in order to justify affiliate links, I kept seeing that Neutrogena Hydro Boost was mentioned as high on the list in spite of overpriced alternatives being pushed. On the more credible  websites, it was presented as a surprisingly good choice in spite of its lower cost by comparison with some of the others. I finally tried it for the first time tonight and I can tell you, right off the bat after quite a thorough face washing, the kind that makes for tight feeling skin, after applying it, there was no feeling of residue but my face felt healthy and nourished. I will definitely update this review after some time using it regularly, but I wanted to share specifically that immediately, first time using, it goes on wet because it's a gel, but nothing sticky about it, it absorbed or for all I know dissipated otherwise, but my facial skin feels noticeably balanced and calmed.  The consistency is really nice feeling and comforting. Not oily or greasy (or in any other way like a superficial ""coating"") in the least."
5,I Love how it leaves my skin.its refreshing and leaves my skin very soft. I have older skin so that is a plus.
5,Best moisturizer for dry skin. I really love this . Very hydrating and it’s also have Hyaluronic acid which is very good for skin.
5,"Wish I had discovered this sooner! I never used moisturizer until the past couple of years (now that my skin is..ahem...mature) This sinks right in, a tiny bit goes a long way and that scent! It reminds me of lilacs and violets, yet isn't strong or overpowering. My face feels so soft and velvety, even though I've only been using 2 or 3 days. Definitely will keep this on my daily routine."
5,Hydrates great.
5,"Great product especially when used as a moisturizer before makeup. Not too heavy, smells great!"
5,"I have sensitive skin and this works great, especially when you purchase the other products from the same line."
5,Loved the water gel texture. Perfect for summer.
5,Exactly as described. great delivery.
5,Non greasy and absorbs well.  Perfect daytime moisturizer.  Feels cool and smooth when applied
5,Perfect for my aging dry skin!
5,"This product is amazing! I’ve been seeing it on commercials and in ads for a while now and finally decided to try it. What took me so long?? This stuff is amazing! From the beginning I noticed a drastic difference in the feeling of my skin and I’m beginning to see a difference! I’m almost 55, live on the beach and also work outside. I have mature skin despite the use of sunscreen and moisturizers throughout my life. Comes with age, I know. Honestly, this product is really making a difference for me. Wish it was sold in larger quantities for full body application! 😁 I will definitely be purchasing again and oh yes I recommend!"
5,"I live in Hawaii and would not like anything that’s heavy to my skin. This is perfect for day and night, all seasons here."
5,I was actually shocked how hydrating this is. Very impressed with how my skin looks after using it.
5,"This product works amazingly. Within 1 week i noticed a major difference on my face. It leaves my skin feeling smooth, acne free and glowing."
5,I tried several moisturizers before finding this one. Most are heavy and cause me to sweat. This feels good and light on my face. Dries quickly on my skin while keeping it feeling moisturized all day. I use it daily. No strong odor.
5,"Hydro Boost is perfectly named because that's what it feels like, a boost of refreshing water on the skin.  This is a very lightweight moisturizer that hydrates the skin and keeps it smooth all day. I have sensitive skin and break out easily. This is perfect for me.  I don't really notice a scent to it."
5,I love it hydrated my skin
5,I had very dry sling from constantly wearing mask and Neutrogena really helped with dry patches. It leave your sling feeling supple and smooth. Great product for the price.
5,"Soaks in quickly, seems to fill out small eye chin lines, very refreshing.  Wish the jar lasted longer.  My husband and I use it up quickly living on the beach in Florida.  I need coupons from Neutragena for this product and can never find any.  Suggestions?  Susan H"
5,I liked everything about this product.

5,"Best moisturizer I've ever used!  Skin glows.  Not greasy.  In fact, keeps grease at bay... doesn't make make-up run.  Softens fine lines amazingly well.  Leaves a lasting positive effect too!  Not just a temporary puffing of fine lines and wrinkles!  It sells itself after trying it for a week!"
5,"The best moisturiser, it is perfect for my very sensitive skin! I've used a lot of moisturisers and creams and this is the best I've gotten. The cream is not thick, it is very light and fast to absorb"

5,"I'm quite picky with my face moisturizer. I always come back to this specific one. I have gone through at the least, 5 tubs! I have oily/combo skin and I love how this makes my face feel. The smell is not overwhelming either."
5,"Love how it applies, leaves skin soft,  smells nice and mild, decent amount for the price. It was so hot when it arrived that it was a watery consistency. Hopefully that won't spoil the ingredients!"

5,I love this moisturizer.  Light and so nourishing!
5,Love the feeling on my face
5,I’m in love with Neutrogena products period! This cream has so much moisture in it. I apply this after cleansing every morning
5,I’ve tried many creams but this one by far is the best. Not only does it provide moisture for my sensitive skin but it does so without the heavy scents some tend to have. It’s all I use.
5,I love this moisturizer.  It’s got a nice slight tingle to it and and is not greasy.  I like the little bit of glow it gives.
5,"This product is amazing! I have acne-prone skin and have struggled for YEARS trying to find something that is lightweight enough to not make me have clogged pores and break out, but also moisturizes well and THIS IS IT. This stuff is so lightweight and smooth, it’s just blends right in and makes your face so soft. Also, there isn’t a whole lot of fragrance which I like, but the little bit it has just smells like clean - I like it a lot"
5,"I love using hyaluronic acid at night. After cleansing, this product really relieves my skin and prepares me for sleep. Worth the price, it's on sale sometimes at your local grocery/retail pharmacy (like CVS) so look out for it there. I only wish I could easily recycle my product's package back to the company AND that they didn't test on animals.No scent. This night cream is a little thicker than the regular hydroboost and can be used for a longer amount of time I have noticed. These packages usually last me a couple months. A+++"
5,AMAZING. Very pleased with it. Lightweight and long-lasting
5,I love this product so much feels amazing on the skin use it everyday
5,I like it does make my face looks nice and clear  it gives it this hydration look and feel it's nice.
5,I put this on after washing my face and it makes my face feel soft and moisturized. I recommend it for everyone.
5,I love this moisturizer. It’s so moisturizing and the smell is very nice as well. It leaves your skin glowing and very soft!
5,I used to have serious dryness issues where my skin would literally flake away. Used a very little amount of this cream and all the dryness went away. Seriously a god sent. Never used any other cream which worked so well for me.
5,I had to change my skincare routine after getting pregnant and this is 100% staying after I give birth. It makes my skin so incredibly soft and no breakouts whatsoever! I highly recommend.
5,"I have tried a lot of face creams and moisturizers. Many have made my face break out. I am 43!!! Why in my 40s it is ok for acne is beyond me! This is by far the best I have been used. Scent, sheerness, doesn’t feel heavy or greasy on my face. I use at night and in the am.I love this product and recommend to everyone."
5,I thought the hydro boost gel was incredible - but then I tried this. Absolutely marvelous!
5,"My daughter loves my PTR Water Drench but has a teen’s budget. After trying this product, I’ll be switching to this Neutrogena moisturizer, too. Great product at a great price."
5,I just received this 06/22/21 I only had it for one day and I already like it my face is pretty dried/flaky at times one day of use my face feels a little smoother this is exactly what I needed.
5,This is my fourth time buying this cream.  Great under my makeup and my skin looks great for my age (59). My 28 year old daughter loves it also.
5,"I absolutely love this!! It is so light but moisturizing. My skin feels incredibly hydrated and I've noticed less acne (i didn't have a ton to begin with). It also doesn't have a scent, which i love because those can be harsh on the skin. This is now my go-to product. I can't get enough!"
5,I love this moisturizer. I will be purchasing again soon. I have very sensitive skin and almost every moisturizer would make my face break out except this one. It’s very light as well. I love it
5,Great product! It beat my expectations!
5,What a surprise! At 71 my skin looks like I am in my fifties. This Neutrogena product is my favorite moisturizer. I have used hyaluronic serum for several years and I am pleased that it is an ingredient here. Neutrogena products have been on my table for years and this is my favorite.
5,I'm very happy with this product. Have been using it for several weeks and I can see and feel the difference in my skin.
5,Light and not greasy. No perfume scent quite neutral
5,I have been using this product since 2018 and I really love it
5,Love this stuff! I hate lotion and how greasy it is and this is not. Leaves my face moisturized without the gross feeling.
5,"Literally feels so cool , feels easy on me , smoothLove the feeling"
5,"this product really feels good on the skin, im old and cant expect much, but if it feels goood you have me as a customer. i love it."
5,"I have never left a review for a product before, but oh my gosh. I LOVE THIS MOISTURIZER. I’ve always had oily skin and I kinda just accepted it and even embraced it when all else fails. But I have used this moisturizer while my skin is damp every single day for 5 days now and my skin looks absolutely incredible and oil-free. My skin looks plump and healthy and not dry or tight. I have acne-prone skin too and I have not broken out once. I recommend to anyone with sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. You’ll look forward to putting this on every morning/night :) also, it does have a bit of a scent, but I don’t have any issues with that. My skin doesn’t freak out and I would say I have sensitive skin. I like it, smells clean. And not in a bad way ;)"
5,Just a really good ultra hydrating moisturizer with no oily or greasy feel. Doesn't make me break out. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin
5,This is good for all skin types and it help's moisturize your face and is light weight and works great in heat. Makes your skin nice and soft
5,I been using this product on my neck &Forehead .  I like this product
5,Great moisturizer and I have tried a few. There is a distinct scent but I felt a difference in my skin after a few days. Use in the morning after brushing teeth or at night before bed. Works great and I can feel the difference for better feeling skin.
5,I get dry cracked skin especially in the winter and most moisturizers burn my sensitive skin except for this one. It is my go to I would recommend for anyone
5,Great moisturizer at a great buy
5,Absolutely love this stuff! Keeps my face moisturized all day! Never going back to anything else!
5,She likes it and says it works and that is all that counts!
